Errungenschaften: Ja

Positiv:
- Verschiedene Alien-Rassen

Negativ:
- Viele Abstürze
- Frustrierende Fehler

Fazit:
Was habe ich mir hier angetan? Anfang 2022 habe ich zum ersten Mal Lords of the Black Sun gespielt. Es war ein Desaster! Die vielen Abstürze und frustrierenden Fehler haben dafür gesorgt, das ich es in den tiefen meiner Steam-Bibliothek einstauben lassen habe.
Jetzt, 3 Jahre später, habe ich dieses Spiel im Rahmen meiner Errungenschaften-Jagd-Kampagne herausgekramt, um es zu vervollständigen. Hätte ich es mal gelassen...
Das Spiel wurde komplett vergessen. Es gab keine Updates oder sonstige Verbesserungen, was dazu führte, das dieses Spiel mehr Lebensstunden und Nerven aufgebraucht hat, als es eigentlich verdient hätte. Die Abstürze und Fehler sind weiterhin vorhanden. (Bsp.: Ich musste einmal neu laden, damit mein eigener Planet, nicht als feindlicher angezeigt wird.)
Lords of the Black Sun ist ein Weltraum-Strategie-Spiel was viel verspricht, aber nur wenig einhält. Das einzig positive an dem Spiel waren die verschiedenen Alien-Rassen, die fantasievoll umgesetzt worden sind. Ansonsten ist das Spiel nicht Empfehlenswert!!!!","Recommended: No (personal rating: 3/10)

Achievements: Yes

Positive:
- Various alien races

Negative:
- Numerous crashes
- Frustrating bugs

Conclusion:
What have I done to myself? I first played Lords of the Black Sun in early 2022. It was a disaster! The numerous crashes and frustrating bugs caused me to let it gather dust in the depths of my Steam library.

Now, three years later, I dug this game out as part of my achievement-hunting campaign to complete it. If only I hadn't...
The game was completely forgotten. There were no updates or other improvements, which resulted in this game consuming more life hours and nerves than it actually deserved. The crashes and bugs are still there. (Example: I had to reload once to prevent my own planet from being shown as an enemy one.)
Lords of the Black Sun is a space strategy game that promises a lot but delivers little. The only positive thing about the game were the various alien races, which were imaginatively implemented. Otherwise, the game is not recommended!!!!"

Many lazy ""amateur"" developers don't pay attention to their obligations under copyright law, and often steal the ideas of actual, real game developers without credit, such as the ""developer"" here has done.

Putting aside the unethical intellectual bankruptcy of stealing someone else's game concept for profit, this is also breaking that unwritten law of stealing other people's game ideas... you should at least try to do better than the game you're ripping off.  ""Lords of the Black Sun"" is considerably worse than Master of Orion.  You could even say this is MoO from Wish.  And that's being generous. 

Don't get me wrong, there's a steady demand for Master of Orion style space 4-x games.  Stellaris fills a lot of that niche, but it's also a flawed game in some ways (like being punishingly difficult unless you stick to one single playstyle... build military like crazy or die). 

This is really badly made, clunky, missing a lot of features... it was dumped out of Early Access without being completed, and should be treated as any other abandoned Early Access failure. 

On the upside, the game does feature customisable controls and resolution, so at least some of the basic, minimum requirements have been met.  Unfortunately there's a number of other technical defects and shortcomings which contribute to the game being difficult to recommend to gamers.

The game features lazy low-polygon ""retro"" assets, making this look like a barely functional 3D game from the mid 2000s.  It's unclear why the developers weren't able to arrange high quality, high polygon count contemporary assets for the game, and also irrelevant... what matters is that this looks bad as a result of their decisions, a compromise PC gamers shouldn't have to put up with.

The game only displays in 4:3 pillarboxed aspect ratio.  It's possible they developed this using an old CRT they found in a dumpster, or this game has been specifically designed for people gaming on PC's from 1995... either way, this isn't really acceptable in the modern era of PC gaming.

These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.

Reviewing SteamDB to check how popular this game was with players reveals a surprise... there's a modest spike in player counts for the game.  But this only happened once, around the same time that trading cards were applied to the game... so this is just card idlers getting their cards and moving on.  A closer look at the numbers shows the game just has a couple of players every week running up the game and idling it for cards, then deleting it.  We must ask how it benefits gamers for there to be so many games like this, with no merit as a serious game, that only generate sales from people idling and selling the trading cards.

So, should you buy this game?  Is this one of the best of the 100,000+ games on Steam?

""Lords of the Black Sun"" has the utterly INSANE cash grab price of $25 USD, for which you could easily get any number of older AAA games.  Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, this is impossible to recommend.  For comparison, the $25 asking price for this game could get you games like ""Dishonored 2"", ""The Elder Scrolls Online"" or the Mass Effect Trilogy Pack (all three Mass Effect games!).  This costs more than twice what you could expect to pay for Stellaris!!!!

 И появилась Arkavi Studios Португальская маленькая но амбиционная инди-компания которая анонсировала 4х космо. стратегию Lords of the Black Sun.

Релиз игры 12 сен. 2014.

Игроки завалили претензиями разработчиков о качестве.  
 Дети думали что когда они будут ставить палиц в низ и опускать рейтинг игры разрабы их услышат и поймут.

Почти так и получилось. Разрабы услышали. И через три месяца после релиза закрыли студию Arkavi Studios.

Дети остались со своими гордо высказаными мнениями и одним патчем от 17 ноя. 2014.



 И в 2015 году появилась Grey Wolf Entertainment Португальская маленькая но амбиционная инди-компания которая анонсировала 4х космо. стратегию Dawn of Andromeda.

Дата выхода 4 мая. 2017.

Ха ха ха безжалостный космос ждёт вас детки.","Back in 2012, a small but ambitious Portuguese indie company called Neogen2 Creations announced a 4x space strategy game called Star Lords.

A year later, the company dissolved.

And then came Arkavi Studios, a small but ambitious Portuguese indie company that announced a 4x space strategy game called Lords of the Black Sun.

The game was released on September 12, 2014.

Players inundated the developers with complaints about the quality.

The kids thought that by downgrading the game's rating, the developers would hear and understand.

That's almost exactly what happened. The developers listened. And three months after the release, Arkavi Studios was closed.

The kids were left with their proudly voiced opinions and a single patch from November 17. 2014.

And in 2015, Grey Wolf Entertainment, a small but ambitious Portuguese indie company, was born, announcing the 4X space strategy game Dawn of Andromeda.

Release date: May 4, 2017.

Hats off to those talented Portuguese developers.

Ha ha ha, the merciless cosmos awaits you, kids."

Jedoch, ist ""Lords of the Black Sun"" wirklich so grauenhaft, wieviele der Reviews es hier wiedergeben. Das Spielt wirkt wie eine völlig unfertige Version und ist leider voll mit Bugs und anderen Fehlern. Die Idee ist an sich sehr gut, jedoch ist die Umsetzung so unfertig das es echt unspielbar ist und leider keinen Spaß macht.

Die 5 Euro hätte ich wohl besser woanders investiert. Bin leider sehr enttäuscht vom Entwickler Studio und dem Publisher das sie so ein Spiel tatsächlich veröffentlichen und verkaufen. Desweiteren ist es Schade drum das Steam dieses Spiel tatsächlich weiterhin verkauft. :(

Kleiner Tipp an alle die eine gute 4X alternative zu ""Lord of the Black Sun"" suchen.  Endless Space und Pandora - First Contact sind günstig zu haben und mit den DLCs kosten beide Spiele nur jeweils 20 €. Damit wird man auf jedenfall mehr Spaß haben und bekommt dafür ältere aber auch ausgereifte Spiele.","I bought this game a while ago for a small amount of money and thought I couldn't go wrong with it.

However, is ""Lords of the Black Sun"" really as terrible as many of the reviews here suggest? The game feels like a completely unfinished version and is unfortunately riddled with bugs and other errors. The idea itself is very good, but the implementation is so unfinished that it's truly unplayable and unfortunately not fun.

I would have been better off investing the €5 elsewhere. I'm unfortunately very disappointed with the developer studio and the publisher for actually releasing and selling such a game. Furthermore, it's a shame that Steam continues to sell this game. :(

A little tip for anyone looking for a good 4X alternative to ""Lord of the Black Sun"": Endless Space and Pandora - First Contact are affordable, and with the DLCs, both games only cost €20 each. You'll definitely have more fun with them and get older, yet mature games."

As with all space strategy games, it comes to a point where it's just a slog - dealing with one civilization after another. Spent my 5 hours on building trade routes and being mr. nice potato to everyone I met. Have to play it multiple times to see what strategy will push you to a resolution, I played 2 incomplete rounds in the 5.1 hours as of this review.
First round, I didn't make any Colony ships so really only had the one planet.
Second round, I expanded to 5 areas, made 5 friends, Allied with 1, declared war on another.. but then I was deep into the slog.

I think Production only has to do with the planet it's on, whereas Research adds across your empire. The number of factories you can build depends on the 'Resources' of the planet, so often you can make 2 Factories, then all Research. Demolish later to add banking, police and whatever else you unlock, depending on the planet's purpose. What I should have built more of were shipyards as it took 11 turns to get anything from my Home to the front lines.

Research Tree is pretty vast; it's split into 3 categories - Science, Economics, Military. Spent most of my research on Economics to get the gravy flowing, then some into Science to help later research. Military I only touched for the engines, really. But if you focus on Economics, then you should finish with them as progress will just slog while you get your weapons up to snuff.

Menus are pretty self-explainatory. You have a handshake for diplomacy, eye for intelligence, ship-with-arrow for next ship.. stuff like that. You only have to click on them once or twice to see what they do. Only issue I had with that is the Tutorial's (descriptive boxes) font is really small.

Navigational plane is 2-d, and I haven't touched on battles yet. Ships have a preset shape; the 'building' part is just placing different parts into their respective slots so kinda disappointed about that honestly.

Conclusion: Currently it's marked as 32.99 CAD and for that price.. HELLLLLLLL No. I got it on a Steam sale for a really good price so in my opinion 10.00 is the most I'd pay... but when it comes to a Steam Sale, I can still be El Cheapo :P.","Hasn't crashed on me yet.

Das Spiel hat es bis in die Beta geschafft, dann erfolgte geraume Zeit kein Update und schließlich wurde die letzte erschienene Beta als ""final"" bzw. ""release Version"" bezeichnet und sämtliche weitere Entwicklung eingestellt. Das Spiel ist also unfertig geblieben. Sehr schade, da es während der Entwicklung zunächst einen wirklich guten Eindruck gemacht hatte.
Man kann wohl tatsächlich behaupten, dass die Entwickler mit dem Early-Access das gewünschte Geld verdient und dann vor dem Release die Arbeit eingestellt haben. Die Typen sitzen jetzt vermutlich wie dieser miese Lars Ulrich an nem Pool, lachen über die Käufer und schlürfen Cocktails. Sollen sie doch an der Obsteinlage ersticken!

Mittlerweile ist mir zu Ohren gekommen, das gleiche Team arbeite an einem Titel namens ""Dawn of Andromeda"" (oder so ähnlich). Ein weiterer Versuch eines MoO-artigen 4x-Spiels. Diesmal gibt es keinen Cent von mir, selten kam ich mir derart veräppelt vor, wie bei Lords of the Black Sun. 

Schade, dass nun auch die kleinen Studios mit solchen Betrügereien anfangen, man kennt sowas ja sonst eher von Ubisoft & Co.

[b]TL;DR[/b]
[b]Auf keinen Fall kaufen, keinen Cent für Leute, die E/A-Versionen als ""final"" umdeklarieren und dann die Entwicklung einstellen.[/b]","It started as a promising Early Access game. The game made it to beta, then there was no update for quite some time, and finally, the last beta released was labeled the ""final"" or ""release version,"" and all further development was halted. So the game remained unfinished. It's a shame, since it had initially made a really good impression during development.
You could actually say that the developers made the money they wanted from Early Access and then stopped work before release. They're probably sitting by a pool like that lousy Lars Ulrich, laughing at the buyers and sipping cocktails. Let them choke on the fruit!

I've since heard that the same team is working on a title called ""Dawn of Andromeda"" (or something like that). Another attempt at a MoO-like 4x game. This time, I'm not contributing a cent; I've rarely felt as taken for a ride as I did with Lords of the Black Sun.

It's a shame that even smaller studios are now resorting to such scams; we're more used to seeing this kind of thing from Ubisoft and the like.

El género 4X (explorar, expandir, explotar, exterminar) se refiere a los juegos de estrategia con cientos de opciones para personalizar, una elaborada historia, diversas batallas por turnos y mucha gestión de las tropas, recursos, bases, etc. Hoy probamos Lords of the Black Sun, una nueva interpretación del género de mano de Arkavi Studios y publicado por Iceberg Interactive, por el momento en fase Beta desde diciembre del 2013 en Steam con la opción de Acceso Anticipado, que pretende ofrecer lo mejor de otros títulos del género ambientados en el futuro tales como Endless Space, Stardrive o Master of Orion. Aptitudes no le faltan como veremos a continuación.

Lords of the Black Sun, que anteriormente se conocía como Star Lords (el nombre se cambió en abril de este año, quizás para no confundirlo con el protagonista de la inminente película Guardianes de la Galaxia o con la fase beta de Master of Orion, allá en la época de los 90), nos lleva a un vasto universo con cientos de secretos y peligros que descubrir, con ocho razas muy diferentes que buscan hacerse con el control de todos los planetas, descubriendo diversas ruinas milenarias, haciendo complicadas alianzas interplanetaria y venciendo a los rudos piratas que solo buscan la riqueza rápida.

El planteamiento del juego es el mismo que otros títulos 4X futuristas aunque en esta ocasión las ocho razas son muy diferentes entre sí, no solo en el aspecto sino en sus árboles de habilidad y las propiedades de cada una. Contamos por ejemplo con los agresivos Atrox, la raza acuática modificada genética Xenom, los rocosos Kriffith, los equilibrados humanos, los lagartos humanoides Draakian, los religiosos Rasmuth, los avanzados Arkonoss o los peligrosos Commatus; aparte claro está de los piratas que tienen algunos sus propias razas y aparte de repelerlos podemos comprar su protección o sobornarles.

","Early Access Impressions. You can read the full review at Areajugones: http://areajugones.es/2014/07/16/impresiones-lords-of-the-black-sun/

The 4X genre (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) refers to strategy games with hundreds of customization options, an elaborate story, diverse turn-based battles, and extensive management of troops, resources, bases, etc. Today we're trying out Lords of the Black Sun, a new take on the genre from Arkavi Studios and published by Iceberg Interactive. Currently in Beta since December 2013 on Steam with the Early Access option, it aims to offer the best of other future-set titles in the genre such as Endless Space, Stardrive, or Master of Orion. It has plenty of capabilities, as we'll see below.

Lords of the Black Sun, formerly known as Star Lords (the name was changed in April of this year, perhaps to avoid confusion with the protagonist of the upcoming Guardians of the Galaxy film or with the beta phase of Master of Orion, back in the 1990s), takes us to a vast universe with hundreds of secrets and dangers to discover, with eight very different races seeking to take control of all the planets, discovering various ancient ruins, forming complicated interplanetary alliances, and defeating ruthless pirates only seeking quick riches.

The game's approach is the same as other futuristic 4X titles, although this time the eight races are very different from each other, not only in appearance but also in their skill trees and the properties of each one. We have, for example, the aggressive Atrox, the genetically modified aquatic Xenom race, the rocky Kriffith, the balanced humans, the humanoid lizard Draakian, the religious Rasmuth, the advanced Arkonoss, and the dangerous Commatus; apart from, of course, the pirates, some of whom have their own races, and in addition to repelling them, we can buy their protection or bribe them.

I love 4X space games and I was hoping that that alone will overcome all the problems this game might throw at me. Sadly I have to agree with other reviews – this game goes out of its way, to frustrate you, ruining any possible fun.

I guess I’m lucky in the fact that I got it on a huge discount (the only option I would recommend anyone getting this)

I don’t recommend playing this game on bigger size of galaxy when vs AI – the map is big enough anyway and tbh size differences in the galaxy settings are very small increments. The only reason I’d choose the bigger galaxy sizes is if I have all 8 factions in play, and most crucially playing it in multiplayer. The distance between systems vs the speed of the ships is really far and AI has an awful tendency to snatch the best planets from under your nose making all the empire borders look as a checkered patchwork of planets on the bigger maps.

Good:
+ Has multiplayer (every 4X tbs should imo) including LAN
+ You can scan planets to find out their bonuses (but this at times feels like a waste of time)
+ During exploration you find special debris that works as a special encounter
+ You can give speeches for glory-hole points
+ The type of government your empire has depends on your policies
+ I like the in-game music
+ You can do diplomacy with pirate clans - even use them to harass your enemies (AI factions will make sure they harass you anyway)
+ Different factions to play (8 total) – tech tree and buildings seem identical while govt type, faction bonuses, preferred planets and ship models differ
+ Trading cards
+ Diplomacy
+ Trade routes
+ Random events
+ Turn based battles on hex battlefield

Bad:
- Multiplayer is human only. The game won’t let you add AI factions to play with you and your friends when you play multiplayer
- Only two types (shapes) of galaxy to choose from disc or circle
- Four main galaxy ambient backgrounds, nice bluish ones or an ugly muddy mustard ones
- Reloading saved games is very bugged often creating weird things and most importantly – loading the next turn instead the one you saved the game at.
- No sound in intro movies for me (have to watch them straight from the game folder in explorer to just get the vibe)
- Alt-tab doesn’t work
- No schematic view for ship designs you’ve already created makes it hard to remember what design had what module
- Cycling between planets is bugged, if you go left then right… it will take you to the wrong planet, so basically you can cycle them just one way at a time
- Game does feel empty at times, so I recommend you play it with good buddies to actually make up for less actual content

Ugly:
- AI cheats, especially during colonization phase. AI factions have colony ships spawn out of nowhere right next to the planet you were on the way to colonize flying there over 10 turns. And in fact, if you load a save 3 turns earlier or so, their colony ship might spawn even sooner and it’s kind of like random which AI faction will it be, including those far far away from the colony you’re aiming for
- AI cheats and gets at least 8 warships at the start of the game when they couldn’t possibly make them so fast (every AI faction gets it, not just the more industrious ones)
- When you load the game your ships will all be crippled to 5AU speed instead of full speed, which further compounds the planet stealing by AI or outmaneuvering you since you won’t even be able to reach the target planet even if you adjust your planning with reloading the save
- You can put more than 1 type of weapon on a ship design, but during a battle you can shoot only 1 weapon type at once per ship, while in practice this might make sense for you to say use missiles if enemy is away then beam/plasma when close, in practice you start the battle very close so firing long range loses the benefit and the limited number of hulls available in the game (4) makes it practically pointless to mix weapon types
- There’s no experience on the ships, so fighting AI (pirates or other factions) is a chore, even on easy difficulty because they keep getting tons of new ships out of nowhere, while you need to keep sending your own at them over and over eventually running out of cash unless you have a very strong economy already. The good thing is that other than pirates AI factions tend to be rather peaceful so I’m not saying it’s impossible to beat them, it’s just far more frustrating and time consuming experience you would want

The game also has a “total war” option which puts all AI factions at war with each other since the beginning of the game, which theoretically might be better (haven’t tried it myself) but I worry it might make things worse and with the level of AI cheating they would simply all gang up on you from the start which is not fun at all.

I must be the lucky one because so far the game hasn’t crashed for me even once.

Bottom line is, it’s an overpriced, often frustrating 4X game with bluntly cheating AI. I still probably recommend it if you want to play it in multiplayer (just remember, no AI factions in multi) but mostly because I love space 4X games so that is my bias.","I really wanted to recommend this game. I love 4X space games and I was hoping that that alone will overcome all the problems this game might throw at me. Sadly I have to agree with other reviews – this game goes out of its way, to frustrate you, ruining any possible fun.

I guess I’m lucky in the fact that I got it on a huge discount (the only option I would recommend anyone getting this)

I don’t recommend playing this game on bigger size of galaxy when vs AI – the map is big enough anyway and tbh size differences in the galaxy settings are very small increments. The only reason I’d choose the bigger galaxy sizes is if I have all 8 factions in play, and most crucially playing it in multiplayer. The distance between systems vs the speed of the ships is really far and AI has an awful tendency to snatch the best planets from under your nose making all the empire borders look as a checkered patchwork of planets on the bigger maps.

Good:
+ Has multiplayer (every 4X tbs should imo) including LAN
+ You can scan planets to find out their bonuses (but this at times feels like a waste of time)
+ During exploration you find special debris that works as a special encounter
+ You can give speeches for glory-hole points
+ The type of government your empire has depends on your policies
+ I like the in-game music
+ You can do diplomacy with pirate clans - even use them to harass your enemies (AI factions will make sure they harass you anyway)
+ Different factions to play (8 total) – tech tree and buildings seem identical while govt type, faction bonuses, preferred planets and ship models differ
+ Trading cards
+ Diplomacy
+ Trade routes
+ Random events
+ Turn based battles on hex battlefield

I love the genre, and it seemed to look very nice, but the actual product was not as good as expected from the description, screenshots, and video. It seems to lack polish and actually seems somewhat unfinished, with plenty of bugs and lacklustre dev support.

On to the one pro I've found so far for the game... the hex-based, turn-based space combat is actually a quite interesting addition to the 4x space genre, and one that I quite like. Admittedly, it can turn into a bit of a chore once the participants have large fleets, if you can get to that stage... but I do like the idea.

However... the game is plagued with a multitude of crashes, which makes any sort of progress, especially in multiplayer, very frustrating. Even when you're lucky enough to not encounter a Crash to Desktop, the gameplay itself is not quite up to scratch. The tech tree and units are somewhat disappointing, and there are many better games out there if you want to customise your own space ships as part of your plans for galactic domination - which brings me to my next point - the galactic maps are pretty sub-par. It doesn't look nice, the travel is boring (there are no restrictions or wormholes or gravity wells or any other mechanic) between systems. There is an arbitrary limit on which systems you can travel though, in an expanding circle, but I have not been able to figure out how that works, but apart from that, you can travel to any system without any changes.

And the economic and diplomatic options are both also disappointing. This combos with the 8 ""different races"" you can play as or against - they don't look or feel different, and the bonuses and ""unique generals"" aren't very noticeable. In combination with the lack of options, and a lack of descriptions of the various pre-game setup options... it just doesn't make for a compelling experience.

Weit gefehlt!

Das Handling der verscheidenen Steuermenüs ist anstrengend und umständlich, die Aufteilung der einzelnen Menus zum Teil sinnfrei, die Aufteilung beim Schiffsbau (ja, man kann eigene Schiffe entwerfen, allerdings nur die zu verwendenden Module beeinflussen, nicht die Hüllenform) schlecht (für ein Frachtschiff benötigt man die größte vorhandene Struktur? Mit was soll ich dann Schlachtschiffe bauen?) das Spiel nicht stabil, generell sieht alles lieblos und auf das BNötigste reduziert aus und eine deutsche Übersetzung im Spiel (bis auf einzelne Wörter) ist schlichtweg nicht vorhanden.

Wer bei Weltraumkolonisationen von MOO geprägt ist und etwas ähnliches sucht, sollte einer Enttäuschung vorbeugen und die Finger von diesem Titel lassen.

So long!

Far from it!

Managing the various control menus is tiring and cumbersome, the layout of the individual menus is sometimes pointless, the layout of the shipbuilding (yes, you can design your own ships, but only influence the modules to be used, not the hull shape) is poor (for a cargo ship, you need the largest available structure? What am I supposed to use to build battleships?), the game is unstable, everything generally looks sloppy and reduced to the bare essentials, and there is simply no German translation in the game (except for a few words).

Но я забегаю вперёд. Начну всё же сначала.

Итак, Lords of the Black Sun - это очередной клон Master of Orion. Здесь вроде бы есть всё: несколько существенно отличающихся рас для игрока и оппонентов, большая (при желании) галактика, три дерева исследований, строительство на планетах, дизайн кораблей, походовые бои, дипломатия, пираты, независимые расы... В общем, всё замечательно. В теории.

На практике всё выглядит далеко не так хорошо.

Во-первых, игра и не думает следить за вашими кораблями. Более того, если корабли находятся над планетами, она даже их и не показывает! Поэтому первые ходы можно славно провести время, строя себе флот, и только потом обнаружить, что у тебя над планетой нужные корабли уже висят.

Впрочем, управление уже существующими флотами ничуть не более дружелюбно. Игра покажет вам корабль, у которого нет приказов (и который не висит над планетой) - если вы её об этом попросите. А не попросите - и не покажет. Можете прощёлкать десять ходов, и только потом спохватиться, что как-то давно не получали вестей от скаутов. Обычное дело. Нет, сводного экрана флотов нет.

С планетами ровно та же самая фигня. Тебя известят о том, что что-то построено, несомненно. Один раз, на экране новостей. С него можно даже перейти к нужной планете! Что, было больше одной планеты? Ну, не повезло. Впрочем, не всё потеряно, можно перейти обратно в меню новостей и выбрать следующую планету- если ты, правда, помнишь, какая была следующая, потому что ""новыми"" отмечаются все новости, что случились в этом ходу. Нет, об удобстве такого управления, если планет два десятка, я даже думать не хочу. Мне и с моими восемью постоянно приходилось помнить, что мне где-то что-то надо построить. Спасибо хоть, на планеты, в отличие от флотов, есть сводная табличка.

С дипломатией история повторяется в третий раз. Да и, собственно, почему бы и нет? Если раса соблаговолит поздороваться с тобой первой - экран дипломатии ты увидишь. Не соблаговолит - можешь с удивлением обнаружить, что уже имеешь дипломатические отношения с кем-нибудь, несколько ходов спустя, случайно.

И такое оно везде. Например, никто не парится с тем, чтобы показывать тебе перемещения противника, поэтому когда из ниоткуда на твоего скаута нападают пираты, получаешь приятный сюрприз. Отступать нельзя, кстати, ага. Статистика прошедшей битвы показывается только один раз, сразу после битвы, и без привязки к системе, так что совершенно непонятно, кто и где бился. Флот показывает, куда он летит, только если выбрать этот самый флот. И так далее, и тому подобное.

Но, может, развитие планет сделано лучше? Там есть туризм, торговля, здоровье, преступность - куча параметров!

Только они все скрыты от игрока. Индустрия считается в единицах. Буквально. Построил одну фабрику - +1 индустрия, построил шесть - +6. С наукой и здоровьем та же самая фигня. Причём хоть индустрия и влияет на производство, но как-то очень опосредованно. В моей столице с населением 13 миллиардов и индустрией 5 космодром строится 5 месяцев. На соседней с индустрией 3 и 16 миллиардами - 2 месяца! А на четвёртой, где индустрия 6, но население 7 миллиардов - 11 месяцев. Блин, а что тогда даёт эта индустрия?! При этом исследования совершенно линейны. 2 лаборатории дают 2 единицы исследования, 6 лабораторий ускоряют исследования в три раза. Здоровье хоть и считается в единицах в описании, нигде эти единицы не показывает. *беспомощно пожимает плечами*

В мануале и в обучающих подсказках предлагается дарить подарки и усиливать защиту малых рас, чтобы заслужить их расположение. При этом в игре нет вообще никаких взаимоотношений с малыми расами, кроме торговли с помощью кораблей.

Я могу ещё долго так распространяться, но, боюсь, никому это не нужно. Допускаю, что на самом деле игра продумана и последовательна и, если привыкнуть к идиотскому интерфейсу и самому с калькулятором в руках узнать _настоящие_ правила (нет, в мануале их нет, я проверял) - может, тогда где-то в глубине этой невнятицы обнаружится бриллиант... но авторам бы стоило приложить сильно больше усилий, если они хотели, чтобы кто-то это разглядел.

Не рекомендую никому, кроме отъявленных стратегов-мазохистов.","A stunningly unfriendly game. It's completely incomprehensible.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me start from the beginning.

So, Lords of the Black Sun is yet another Master of Orion clone. It seems to have everything: several significantly different races for the player and opponents, a large (if desired) galaxy, three research trees, planetary construction, ship design, turn-based combat, diplomacy, pirates, independent races... Basically, everything is great. In theory.

In practice, things are far from perfect.

First of all, the game doesn't bother tracking your ships. Moreover, if your ships are above planets, it doesn't even show them! So, you can have a wonderful time building your fleet in your first turns, only to discover later that you already have the ships you need hovering above the planet.

However, managing existing fleets is no more user-friendly. The game will show you a ship with no orders (and not hovering over a planet) if you ask. If you don't, it won't show you. You can skip ten turns and only then realize you haven't heard from the scouts in a while. That's normal. No, there's no fleet summary screen.

It's exactly the same with planets. You'll be notified that something has been built, no doubt about it. Just once, on the news screen. From there, you can even navigate to the desired planet! What, there was more than one planet? Well, tough luck. However, all is not lost: you can go back to the news menu and select the next planet—if you actually remember what the next one was, because ""new"" is the mark for all news that happened this turn. No, I don't even want to think about the convenience of this kind of control when there are two dozen planets. Even with my eight, I constantly had to remember that I needed to build something somewhere. At least planets, unlike fleets, have a summary table.

Diplomacy is a repeat of itself for the third time. And why shouldn't it be? If a race deigns to greet you first, you'll see the diplomacy screen. If they don't, you might be surprised to discover you already have diplomatic relations with someone, a few turns later, by accident.

And this is everywhere. For example, no one bothers to show you enemy movements, so when pirates attack your scout out of nowhere, you get a pleasant surprise. Retreating is not allowed, by the way. Statistics from the past battle are shown only once, immediately after the battle, and without any system connection, so it's completely unclear who fought where. A fleet only shows where it's heading if you select that fleet. And so on and so forth.

But maybe planetary development is better? They have tourism, trade, health, crime—a ton of stats!

Only they're all hidden from the player. Industry is measured in units. Literally. Build one factory – +1 industry, build six – +6. It's the same with science and health. And although industry does affect production, it's very indirect. In my capital, with a population of 13 billion and an industry of 5, a spaceport takes 5 months to build. In the neighboring capital, with an industry of 3 and 16 billion, it takes 2 months! And in the fourth, with an industry of 6 but a population of 7 billion, it takes 11 months. Damn, what does this industry give then?! And research is completely linear. 2 laboratories give 2 research units, 6 laboratories speed up research three times. Health, although measured in units in the description, is not shown anywhere. *helplessly shrugs*

The manual and tutorial tips suggest giving gifts and boosting the defenses of minor races to gain their favor. However, the game offers no interactions with minor races at all, other than trading via ships.

I could go on like this for a long time, but I'm afraid no one needs it. I admit that the game is actually well-thought-out and consistent, and if you get used to the idiotic interface and learn the _real_ rules yourself with a calculator (no, they're not in the manual, I checked), maybe then, somewhere in the depths of this confusion, you'll find a gem... but the authors should have put in a lot more effort if they wanted anyone to see it.

I don't recommend it to anyone except die-hard masochistic strategists."

Die Ernüchterung folgte jedoch recht schnell.

Was am auffälligsten ist, ist die mangelnde Übersetzung. Sonderzeichen (Ä, Ö, Ü) können nicht dargestellt werden, stattdessen werden diese anders codiert und angezeigt. Ein weiteres Manko ist das Denglisch, Englische Beschreibungen mit vereinzelten Deutschen Wörtern, oder aber dann mal wieder komplett Deutsch bzw. Englisch. Eine deutsche Übersetzung zur Installation anzubieten ist somit eine Farce.
Etwas was die wenigsten betreffen würde ist die Möglichkeit zur Einstellung der Auflösung. Ich konnte hier lediglich bis zu einer Auflösung von 2560 * 1440 gehen. Nicht dass ich mir von einer höheren Auflösung (3840 * 2160)  mehr erwarte, aber es gibt etliche Spiele die dies besser machen.
Bei dieser Auflösung habe ich jedoch auch feststellen müssen, dass sich Texte überlappen. Dies betrifft unter anderem die Kosten für Gebäude, Schiffe oder auch den Diplomatie-Bereich. Somit mutiert es ab und an zu einem Ratespiel was der Hilfetext mir sagen möchte.

Im Spielsetup an sich geht es dann weiter mit Minuspunkten. Ich muss für jede einzelne Rasse in einem Dropdown-Menü einstellen ob sie mitspielt, welcher Schwierigkeitsgrad verwendet wird oder ob sie von einem Menschen übernommen wird. Dies jedoch jedes mal, wenn das Spiel gestartet wird.
Bei der Auswahl der Art des Universums gibt es wahnsinnige 2 Möglichkeiten, aber einen Weiter-Button. Da gibt es ältere Spiele die hier mehr zu bieten haben. Auch die übrigen Einstellungen sind lieblos mit einem 2 eijnfachen Buttons gelöst, ohne erklärende Tooltips etc.

Im Spiel geht es dann geradlinig weiter mit Mängeln. Wenn ich meinem Scout ein Ziel zugewiesen habe ist die Anzeige der Reise-Dauer kontinuierlich falsch. Meist liegt diese bei ""2 Months"", auch wenn die tatsächliche Reisezeit länger ist. Hier ist es auch nicht möglich manuell auf ""weiter fliegen"" zu klicken. Entweder wähle ich ein neues Ziel aus, auch wenn das eigentliche Ziel in der gleichen Runde erreicht wird oder ich beende die Runde. Dann fliegt das Schiff selbstständig die Route weiter. Dies manuell zu machen erfordert einiges an Geduld. Die 4 Buttons auf der Linken Seite über dem Schiff sind alles andere als selbst erklärend und haben natürlich keinen Tooltip. Bisher konnte ich nur 2 der 4 Buttons eine Reaktion entlocken. Entweder zerstören oder erkunden, aber natürlich ein gänzlich anderes Ziel als vorher ausgewählt war.

Das bauen auf dem Planeten ist recht lieblos gelöst worden. Ein paar Statistiken die die Werte des Planeten anzeigen und bei einem Klick auf das i einen Zweizeiler mit teilweise überlappenden Texten. Gebäude werden mit einem Doppelklick in die Bauliste aufgenommen und so aus dieser auch wieder gelöscht. Die gebauten Gebäude werden auf die freien Flächen verteilt und das war es. Der Bericht dass ein neues Gebäude gebaut wurde wäre hilfreich, wenn die Buttons funktionieren würden um zur entsprechenden Kolonie zu springen. Aber hier funktioniert keiner der beiden Buttons, der Bericht kann einfach nur geschlossen werden.

Das Diplomatie-Menü hingegen funktioniert genau entgegengesetzt zum Bau-Menü. Hier muss ich in den Verhandlungen einen Punkt auswählen und auf ""add"" klicken, der Doppelklick funktioniert nicht.

Die Möglichkeit das Imperium individuell anzupassen, z.B. durch ausserirdische Forscher ist ganz nett, jedoch treten auch hier wieder überlappende Texte auf. Somit kann man nur raten wie viel Prozent der eigenen Bevölkerung eine entsprechende Umsetzung wünschen.

Von der Möglichkeit Schiffe selbst zu gestalten kann ich hier getrost abraten. Es gibt lediglich 4 Schiffstypen, hierbei kann man jedoch noch nicht einmal das aussehen selbst gestalten. Das alle Module (Waffen, Antrieb, etc.) eigene Gewichte haben welche das zulässige Gesamtgewicht nicht übersteigen dürfen hört sich gut an. Jedoch habe ich keine Möglichkeit gefunden das zulässige Gesamtgewicht zu steigern, so sieht es auf den ersten Blick aus als wäre es bei keinem Schiff möglich alle Modulplätze zu verwenden. In der Forschung habe ich nichts gefunden. Eventuell werden alte Module leichter wenn man neue erforscht, so weit bin ich jedoch noch nicht vorgedrungen.

Die Forschung an sich ist in 3 Bereiche unterteilt, Waffen, Wirtschaft und Forschung (bin hier ganz sicher über die Namensgebung, dies spielt jedoch keine Rolle). Was auf den ersten Blick auffällt ist dass die meisten Forschungen in der Regel eine Nummer am Ende haben, also bis zur Nummer 3 hoch zählen. Die Beschreibung ist jedes mal identisch zum Vorgänger und alles andere als Innovativ.

Was an dem Spiel interessant ist sind Ereignisse wie z.B. dass eine Piratengang auf dem Planeten randaliert wodurch die Bevölkerung nicht mehr so zufrieden ist. Hierfür gibt es jedoch mittel um dies zu verhindern, z.B. Schutzgeld zahlen.

Fehlende Übersichten über die eigene Anzahl an Schiffen, hier kann nur durch jedes einzeln durchgeklickt werden, trüben jedoch wiederum die Laune.

Spaß macht das Spiel auf keinen Fall, hier machen Klassiker wie Master of Orion alles richtig. Wer auf Rundenbasierte Aufbau-Strategie aus ist sollte den Klassiker wählen. Aber auch Endless Space von Iceberg selbst ist deutlich besser und auch ausgereift.  Daher kann ich von diesem Spiel nur jedem abraten, es ist einfach Geldverschwendung.","At first, I thought the description sounded pretty good. Several races, technology trees, custom ship design, and much more.

Disillusionment followed quickly, however.

What's most striking is the lack of translation. Special characters (Ä, Ö, Ü) can't be displayed; instead, they are encoded and displayed differently. Another shortcoming is the Denglisch (English dialect), English descriptions with a few German words, or sometimes completely German or English. Offering a German translation for installation is therefore a farce.
Something that wouldn't affect most people is the ability to adjust the resolution. I could only go up to a resolution of 2560 x 1440. Not that I expect more from a higher resolution (3840 x 2160), but there are several games that do this better.
However, at this resolution, I also noticed that some text overlaps. This affects, among other things, the costs for buildings, ships, and the diplomacy section. This occasionally turns into a guessing game about what the help text is trying to tell me.

The game setup itself continues with negative points. I have to set for each individual race in a dropdown menu whether they'll participate, what difficulty level to use, or whether they'll be taken over by a human. This happens every time the game starts.
When selecting the type of universe, there are a whopping two options, but only one ""Next"" button. There are older games that offer more in this regard. The other settings are also poorly handled with two simple buttons, without explanatory tooltips, etc.

The game then continues in a straightforward manner with flaws. When I assign my scout a destination, the travel duration display is consistently incorrect. It's usually ""2 months,"" even if the actual travel time is longer. Here, it's also not possible to manually click ""continue flying."" I either select a new destination, even if the original destination is reached in the same round, or I end the round. The ship then flies further along its route independently. Doing this manually requires a fair amount of patience. The four buttons on the left side above the ship are anything but self-explanatory and, of course, don't have a tooltip. So far, I've only been able to get a response from two of the four buttons. Either destroy or explore, but of course, a completely different destination than the one previously selected.

Building on the planet is rather poorly designed. A few statistics display the planet's stats, and clicking the ""i"" displays a two-line text with partially overlapping text. Buildings are added to the construction list with a double-click and deleted from it again. The built buildings are distributed among the free spaces, and that's it. The report that a new building has been built would be helpful if the buttons worked to jump to the corresponding colony. But here, neither button works; the report can simply be closed.

The diplomacy menu, on the other hand, works exactly the opposite of the construction menu. Here, I have to select an item in the negotiations and click ""add""; the double-click doesn't work.

The ability to customize the empire, e.g., with alien explorers, is quite nice, but again, overlapping text appears. So, you can only guess what percentage of your population would like this implementation.

I can confidently advise against the option to customize ships. There are only four ship types, and you can't even customize their appearance. The fact that all modules (weapons, engines, etc.) have their own weights that cannot exceed the maximum permissible weight sounds good. However, I haven't found a way to increase the maximum permissible weight, so at first glance, it doesn't seem possible to use all the module slots on any ship. I haven't found anything in the research section. Perhaps old modules become lighter when you research new ones, but I haven't gotten that far yet.

Research itself is divided into three areas: weapons, economy, and research (I'm quite sure about the naming here, but it doesn't matter). What's noticeable at first glance is that most research tasks usually have a number at the end, meaning they count up to number 3. The description is always identical to its predecessor and anything but innovative.

What's interesting about the game are events like a pirate gang wreaking havoc on the planet, which makes the population less happy. However, there are ways to prevent this, such as paying protection money.

The lack of an overview of your number of ships; you can only click through each one individually, which, in turn, dampens the mood.

The game is definitely not fun; classics like Master of Orion do everything right here. If you're looking for a turn-based strategy game, you should choose the classic. But Endless Space by Iceberg itself is also significantly better and more mature. Therefore, I can only advise everyone against this game; it's simply a waste of money."

Lords Of The Black Sun non è un volto nuovo, ne avevamo parlato ad agosto con qualche riserva, in previsione di scoprire le migliorie aggiunte dai portoghesi di Arkhavi Studios.
Ormai è passato quasi un mese dal rilascio ufficiale del gioco e, non a caso, abbiamo preferito aspettare, vista l’incredibile mole di crash e bug che era stata subito segnalata. Per fortuna, il team assoldato da Iceberg Interactive è corso ai ripari, sfornando una serie di patch che hanno reso Lords Of The Black Sun quantomeno giocabile. Rimane un po’ di amaro in bocca nello scoprire che le modifiche sostanziali che ci aspettavamo nel passaggio da beta a prodotto completo non sono state poi così numerose, ma andiamo con ordine.

Dicevamo, Lords Of The Black Sun è un 4x spaziale che ci permetterà di scegliere tra otto razze diverse quale impersonare: ognuna è dotata di un video introduttivo (piacevole da seguire e con un mezzo tributo al nome stesso degli sviluppatori) che ne spiega rapidamente la storia, ponendoci subito a comando dell’impero da gestire. Purtroppo, nonostante l’idea sfiziosa dell’introduzione, non è prevista alcuna campagna a giocatore singolo, quindi ogni partita sarà incentrata su uno dei due storici obiettivi: la conquista militare, o la supremazia scientifica. A nostra disposizione avremo quello che ci si può aspettare da qualsiasi altro 4x: produzioni di navi stellari, laboratori di ricerca e relativi alberi divisi per rami economici, militari o sociali, commercio intergalattico, pirati da combattere o assoldare, alleanze e voltafaccia. Tra le opzioni interessanti, potremo assoldare delle spie in grado di infiltrarsi dietro le linee nemiche per svolgere lavoretti spionaggio, sabotaggio o semplice analisi. Ogni agente avrà specifici valori per determinare il possibile successo e/o, nel caso di fallimento, la capacità di non farsi beccare o rivelare informazioni per noi importanti.

Altro elemento che ho apprezzato molto è stato come i portoghesi abbiano deciso di pianificare il lato politico, lasciando libera scelta di applicare o meno riforme sostanziali. Ne avevo già accennato nell’anteprima, ma potremo imporre la schiavitù, vietare l’immigrazione o perfino legalizzare l’utilizzo di droghe. Ogni scelta avrà ripercussioni sociali e finanziarie (come quella delle cure libere per tutti — un salasso) che potranno portare alla formazione di gruppi di criminali, o perfino a faide interne con fazioni di ribelli. Ammetto che è davvero difficile finire in simili condizioni, bisogna proprio andare contro i principi morali di una razza per vedere grossi eventi, o conquistare con la forza pianeti di razze minori. La scelta presente però abbellisce un gioco che, purtroppo, di base non ha veramente molto da offrire, al di là delle semplici attività che ogni altro 4x potrebbe avere. La sensazione che Lords Of The Black Sun sia stato pensato per novizi è molto forte, perché altrimenti significherebbe trovarsi di fronte a un titolo estremamente superficiale. Questo non tanto perché manchino caratteristiche più approfondite (o meglio, qualcuna manca, ma l’esperienza generale non ne risente troppo), ma piuttosto per via della buona offerta di gioco che però non scalfisce la curiosità di ogni giocatore.

Per esempio, saremo libero di creare e personalizzare delle navi per montare armi e moduli ricercati: questi modelli però saranno sempre 4 (leggero, medio, pesante, gigante) e non è prevista alcuna modifica grafica o strutturale come, invece, avevamo visto in Sword Of The Stars II. In più, anche l’effetto grafico sarà del tutto anonimo, adattandosi ai modelli prestabiliti per ogni razza con una skin semitrasparente. Oltre a questo, le meccaniche di microgestione seguono una struttura ridotta e lineare: avete messo in coda di produzione cinque diversi edifici e volete spostarne uno prima di un altro? Bene, dovrete cancellare l’elenco e rifarlo da capo. Volete girare la visuale col mouse per ammirare i dettagli di pianeti e navi? Appena lascerete il pulsante la telecamera si resetterà all’impostazione predefinita (davvero un peccato vista la grafica). O ancora, quando fate una proposta diplomatica a una razza avversaria, loro controbattono con una personale? Nel caso opposto potrete solo accettare o negare, perdendo il gusto della contrattazione che invece dovrebbe essere alla base di questa caratteristica di gioco. Le razze stesse, piacevoli sul lato estetico e storico, perdono mordente nel momento in cui si analizzano i loro bonus e malus, fin troppo simili tra di loro. E questo a fronte di un’I.A. che, tutto sommato, lavora bene in base agli eventi, ma che più volte è sembrata in contrasto con lo “stereotipo” della razza in questione (una razza pacifica che mi minaccia di guerra o, peggio, una inferiormente avanzata alla mia che risponde alle mie minacce con sfrontatezza).

Insomma, probabilmente si tratta di sviste da “prima volta” (come pure gli alberi di ricerca tutti uguali per ogni razza) che, penso, siano facilmente migliorabili con alcune patch. Quanto meno, Lords Of The Black Sun presenta pure una modalità multiplayer che in fondo può offrire qualche ora di divertimento tra amici che cercano di farsi la pelle. Purtroppo però, il lavoro generale risulta troppo semplice e superficiale: non è brutto, sia chiaro, ma il nuovo 4x di casa Iceberg Interactive è molto più un playground per nuove leve che un titolo che potrebbe catturare l’attenzione degli esperti mangiagestionali. Lo trovate alla spropositata cifra di 28 euro su Steam unicamente in lingua

CONSIGLIATO A
Chiunque non abbia mai messo mano a un 4x spaziale e voglia iniziare da un titolo semplice, chiaro, ma purtroppo striminzito e chi si è già sventrato tutti i possibili giochi dello stesso genere (ma davvero potete stufarvi di Endless Space?).

SCONSIGLIATO A
Chiunque si aspettasse un gestionale spaziale profondo, completo e stuzzicante. Anche per via della sua non altissima difficoltà, e di eventi di gioco sempre troppo simili, Lords Of The Black Sun potrebbe venirvi presto a noia.","The 4X genre has become overused: I'm not saying one pops up every month, but the release rate has at least tripled in the last year. Lords of the Black Sun is not a newcomer; we discussed it in August with some reservations, anticipating the improvements added by the Portuguese studio Arkhavi Studios.

It's now been almost a month since the game's official release, and it's no coincidence that we preferred to wait, given the incredible number of crashes and bugs that were immediately reported. Fortunately, the team hired by Iceberg Interactive took action, churning out a series of patches that have made Lords of the Black Sun at least playable. It's a bit of a disappointment to discover that the substantial changes we expected from the transition from beta to the full game weren't that numerous, but let's take things one step at a time.

As we were saying, Lords of the Black Sun is a space 4x game that lets us choose from eight different races to embody. Each race has an introductory video (enjoyable to watch and a tribute to the developers' name) that quickly explains its history, placing us immediately in command of the empire we must manage. Unfortunately, despite the intriguing introductory idea, there is no single-player campaign, so each game will focus on one of two historical objectives: military conquest or scientific supremacy. At our disposal we will have what you would expect from any other 4x game: starship production, research laboratories and related trees divided into economic, military, and social branches, intergalactic trade, pirates to fight or hire, alliances, and turncoats. Among the interesting options, we can hire spies capable of infiltrating behind enemy lines to carry out espionage, sabotage, or simple analysis. Each agent will have specific values ​​to determine their potential success and/or, in the event of failure, their ability to avoid being caught or reveal important information.

Another aspect I really appreciated was how the Portuguese decided to plan the political side of things, leaving players free to choose whether or not to implement substantial reforms. I already mentioned this in the preview, but we could impose slavery, ban immigration, or even legalize drug use. Each choice will have social and financial repercussions (such as free healthcare for all—a real drain) that could lead to the formation of criminal groups or even internal feuds with rebel factions. I admit that it's really difficult to end up in such conditions; you really have to go against a race's moral principles to see major events, or forcefully conquer planets of minor races. However, this choice embellishes a game that, unfortunately, doesn't really have much to offer beyond the simple activities any other 4X game might have. There's a strong sense that Lords of the Black Sun was designed for newcomers, as otherwise it would be an extremely superficial title. This isn't so much because it lacks more in-depth features (or rather, some are missing, but the overall experience isn't significantly affected), but rather because of the solid gameplay offerings, which, however, don't dampen player curiosity.

For example, we'll be free to create and customize ships to equip sophisticated weapons and modules: these models, however, will always be four (light, medium, heavy, giant), and no graphical or structural changes are planned, as we saw in Sword of the Stars II. Furthermore, the graphics will also be completely anonymous, adapting to the predefined models for each race with a semi-transparent skin. Furthermore, the micromanagement mechanics follow a reduced and linear structure: have five different buildings queued for production and want to move one before the other? Well, you'll have to delete the list and start over. Want to pan the view with the mouse to admire the details of planets and ships? As soon as you release the button, the camera will reset to its default setting (a real shame, considering the graphics). Or, when you make a diplomatic offer to an opposing race, do they counter with a personal one? Otherwise, you can only accept or deny, losing the taste for bargaining that should be the foundation of this gameplay feature. The races themselves, aesthetically pleasing and historically appealing, lose their edge when you analyze their bonuses and penalties, which are far too similar to each other. And this despite an AI that, all things considered, works well based on events, but which has repeatedly seemed at odds with the ""stereotype"" of the race in question (a peaceful race threatening me with war or, worse, a less advanced race that responds brazenly to my threats).

In short, these are probably first-time oversights (as are the identical research trees for each race) that, I think, could easily be improved with a few patches. At the very least, Lords of the Black Sun also features a multiplayer mode that can ultimately provide a few hours of fun among friends trying to outsmart each other. Unfortunately, however, the overall gameplay is too simple and superficial: it's not bad, to be clear, but Iceberg Interactive's new 4x is much more of a playground for newcomers than a title that could capture the attention of management experts. You can find it for the outrageous price of €28 on Steam in English only.

RECOMMENDED FOR
Anyone who's never played a space 4x game and wants to start with a simple, clear, but unfortunately skimpy title, and those who've already played every possible game in the same genre (can you really get tired of Endless Space?).

NOT RECOMMENDED FOR
Anyone expecting a deep, comprehensive, and engaging space management game. Also due to its moderate difficulty and consistently similar gameplay events, Lords of the Black Sun might quickly become boring."

The UI isn't optimized for a player's experience; it's hard to see even a neophyte developer looking at the UI and thinking, 'the players are going to [b]love this[/b].'  Most of the menuing takes more actions than is really necessary.

Second, the game itself feels utterly [b]soulless.[/b]  It feels like someone started by taking a look at [b]Cid Meyer's Alpha Centauri[/b], then proceeded to put it [b]further into space[/b], but instead of hiring a writer, gave it to someone's nephew.  The result is an experience that doesn't capture the wonder of interstellar colonization, or galactic politics, but is rather an experience that it's hard to care about for even a single session.

Mechanically, the game is sound - as stated above, it's the sort of thing strategy gamers claim to [b]love and want[/b].  The execution is so terrible, especially given the [b]$30 asking price[/b], which is entirely too much for what you're getting.  Firaxis Games, these guys ain't.

[b]PROS:[/b]
[list]
[*]Mechanicallly sound game
[*]Great space visuals
[*]Interesting fleet-to-fleet combat
[*]Good custom unit creation system.
[/list]

[b]CONS:[/b]
[list]
[*]Uninspired, forgettable writing and scenario
[*]Ugly UI that impedes the player
[*]Forgettable music
[*]Unstable game - the end of my expeirence came after the game just crashed for no apparent reason.
[*][b]Way[/b] too expensive for what you're actually getting.
[/list]

Verdict: Avoid it.  The developers need to do some serious work on this game and lower the price for this game to be worth it.  If they will do this, I will take a second look and re-evaluate my review."

Steam unterstützt da leider nicht, ist auch klar, bei so vielen Problemen.

it looks like the problem exists longer. Accordingly, I ask myself again, whether the developers are idiots or do it on purpose. they know very well that so many people have problems, but they ignore that. The main thing they've got money. If I could have the money back - immediately! Unfortunately Steam does not support because so many problems with this game. Only third party support.

Starpoint Gemini 2 is also fully bugged. but - you could start the game.

------------------------------------------

Also nach 3 Monaten ist das Spiel startbar. Es ist noch immer sehr verbuggt, aber nun läuft es wenigstens.

Das Spiel ist zu Hälfte auf Englisch. Wird dann wohl Part für Part übersetzt. Manche Buttons gehen nicht, das wichtigste ist aber erreichbar. Was richtig nervt ist, dass man die Kosten nicht erkennt. Mit etwas Mathe aber (wenn man Auftag erteilt und Kosten von der Summe oben angezogen wird) weiß man irgendwann, was die Sachen kosten.

Das Spiel selbst... Also ich finde es nicht toll. Ich habe das bereits 5 mal gespielt und komme immer noch nicht klar. Es ist ähnlich wie Endless Space. NUR dass hier irgendwie alles schlechter ist: Grafik (nur 2D), Gameplay ... einfach alles.

Vielleicht kurzer Ablauf zum besseren Verständnis:

- Spiel fängt an, irgendwann merkt ihr, dass Forschung still steht. Auch später werdet ihr nicht daran erinnert, also immer aufpassen, wenn Meldung kommt, dass was fertig ist
- Ich habe als erstes angefangen Kolonien zu besiedeln. Bei Gebäuden ist es manchmal nicht klar, wie und wann welches benötigt wird. Forschungslabor, okay klar. Aber Abwehrturm, weiß ich immer noch nicht. Habe meine Planeten verloren, mit und ohne Turm
- Nach Baufertigstellung kann man Button nicht benutzen, also entweder merkt ihr euch alles, was die Runde passiert ist und geht dann zu den jeweiligen Planeten oder ihr geht ab und an alle Planeten durch. Da Bau Geld kostet (egal was), ist es eh so, dass man nicht immer was bauen kann und warten muss, bis man soviel Geld hat
- Bereits fremd besiedelte Planeten muss man mit Truppen einnehmen, das Schiff ist danach nur leerer, kann also weiter verwendet werden. Wenn er auf Planeten bleibt, werden pro Runde wieder Truppen aufgeladen
- Wenn man einen Gegner angreift und sein Planet übernimmt, dann sieht man, dass er alles vollgebaut hat. Ich komme da nicht hinterher, so viel Kohle habe ich nicht
- Ab und an kommen Meldungen, die sich ernst anhören, aber ich zunächst nicht verstanden und ignoriert habe. Ist auch doof, ich muss mir immer Planetnamen merken, zum Planeten springen geht nicht. Nach 3 Meldungen hintereinander wird mir persönlich schwierig das zu merken, wo. Ein Ereignis war, das ein Planet kriminell wurde und rebellierte - musste ich dann mit Truppen wieder erobern. Viel häufiger wird man von Piraten angegriffen, was dann wiederum den Planeten kostet. Da hilft nur Geduld und wenn man gut sein will, am besten die Ereignisse aufschreiben oder so.
- Schlachten werden klassisch auf einer Map ausgetragen, wo rundenbasiert gefight wird. Jedes Schiff darf pro Runde was machen.
- Schiffe muss man selbst designen, was auch cool ist. Leider ist das Gewicht echt schwach. Koloniemodul, und das größte schiff ist voll. Je weiter die Module und Waffen, deso mehr Gewicht kosten sie. Aber Schiffsklassen haben immer das gleiche Gewicht
- Politik richtet sich nach dem, was Bevölkerung will. Mann kann Minister einstellen, die Politik lenken können. Angeblich. Ich habe beim ersten Spiel alles gut gemeint und meine Leute wollten am Ende Diktatur mit Kinderarbeit, ich konnte deren Meinung nicht ändern und wurde immer unbeliebter
- Außerdem kann man Generäle bekommen, die dann ein Schlachtschiff haben und beim Kampf gut mitziehen

okay, ich hoffe das reicht, viel mehr passiert nicht

Ehrlich, kauft euch Endless Space und das Spiel kann euch erspart bleiben.","I can't start the game. Immediately after launch -> crash.

It seems like the problem has been going on for a while. So, I'm wondering again whether the developers are idiots or are doing it on purpose. They know that so many people have problems and they don't care at all. The main thing is that they got their money. If I could have my money back, I'd give it to them immediately! Unfortunately, Steam doesn't support it, which is understandable given so many problems.

Starpoint Genimi 2 is also completely buggy. But at least you could start the game.

I won't buy any more games from this developer. And I'll always convince everyone else not to, so they finally go bankrupt.

------------------------------------------

So, after 3 months, the game is launchable. It's still very buggy, but at least it's running now.

The game is half in English. They'll probably translate it part by part. Some buttons don't work, but the most important ones are accessible. What's really annoying is that you can't see the costs. But with a bit of math (when you place orders and the costs are deducted from the total above), you'll eventually know what the items cost.

The game itself... I don't think it's great. I've played it 5 times already and I still can't figure it out. It's similar to Endless Space. ONLY, everything is somehow worse here: graphics (only 2D), gameplay... simply everything.

Perhaps a brief outline for a better understanding:

- The game starts, and at some point you'll notice that research has stopped. Even later, you won't be reminded, so always pay attention when a message appears that something is finished.
- I started settling colonies first. With buildings, it's sometimes unclear how and when which one is needed. Research lab, okay, sure. But I still don't know about the defense tower. I've lost my planets, with and without the tower.
- After construction is complete, you can't use the button, so you either remember everything that happened that round and then go to the respective planets, or you go through all the planets every now and then. Since construction costs money (no matter what), you can't always build something and have to wait until you have enough money.
- Planets that have already been colonized by others must be conquered with troops; the ship is just emptier afterwards, so you can continue to use it. If he stays on a planet, troops are recharged every round.
- If you attack an opponent and take over their planet, you can see that they've built everything. I can't keep up with it; I don't have that much money.
- Every now and then, messages come up that sound serious, but I didn't understand and ignored at first. It's also annoying; I always have to remember planet names; jumping to a planet isn't possible. After three messages in a row, it becomes difficult for me to remember where. One event was that a planet became criminal and rebelled – I then had to reconquer it with troops. Much more often, you're attacked by pirates, which in turn costs you the planet. The only thing that helps is patience, and if you want to be good, it's best to write down the events or something.
- Battles are fought traditionally on a map, where combat is turn-based. Each ship can do something per round.
- You have to design your own ships, which is also cool. Unfortunately, the weight is really light. Colony module, and the largest ship is full. The larger the modules and weapons, the heavier they are. But ship classes always have the same weight.
- Politics are determined by what the population wants. You can hire ministers who can steer policy. Supposedly. I meant well in the first game, and in the end, my people wanted a dictatorship with child labor. I couldn't change their minds and became increasingly unpopular.
- You can also get generals who then have a battleship and can participate well in combat.

Okay, I hope that's enough, there's not much more to it.

Honestly, buy Endless Space and you can skip the game."

The good: 
- Loads at the beginning but minimal loading afterwards.
- Graphics are crisp but still run on older hardware decently.
- Not overly complex (If you're not looking for complex).
- Accessible for players newer to 4X games.

The bad:
- Grammatical errors to the point where I noticed and it bothered me enough to mention.
- Underwhelming UI.
- Combat is boring.
- Research is boring.
- Production is boring.
- Bland AI and diplomacy.
- Economy that lacks balance. (Or I need a better tutorial for it)
- Too easy for expereinced players.
- Speech system is unbalanced.

I might not have played it enough to see the depth here, but the economy seems to be very simple and not very easy to deal with. If you get it going early and get lucky with the random exploration treasures (and not just have your scout destroyed without a fight) then you can be dominant pretty quickly. If you get set back by a random event (which rarely cost less than 1000 BC) or hit up for protection money too often there's not much you can do to come back. If you lose a planet and suddenly have -12 BC per turn and only around 120 BC in the bank you have literally nothing you can do to come back aside from hoping that you have enough Glory to give the +5000 BC speech. Oh and you earn that glory by winning battles, so if you're behind in military now good luck getting there on that one. The speech system overall seems to just be covering for sloppy design OR this game is specifically trying to be a short playing 4X game, which is kind of a weird concept to me. Case in point. In my last game before I wrote this, I was dominating the galaxy for most of the game with diplomacy and science before a few bad events and one AI deciding to finally attack me left me with only 1 planet left (not my homeworld). So I just pulled up the tech tree and selected the ""You win"" tech (which always seemed to take 28 turns to complete no matter how much science I had) and hit the ""Your current research finishes next turn"" speech to instant win even though I was clearly outmatched otherwise. I did not feel like I was snatching victory from the jaws of defeat, I just felt like I cheated better than the dumb AI did. Also, you need to have an ""Army ship"" stationed at a planet in order for it to be defended at all when attacked, otherwise they just stroll in and take the planet without a fight. This is a conscious design decision I'm sure, but it's not one that I find fun.

I do not recommend this game over other games in the genre. It's not a strictly bad game, and I'm glad developers and publishers are coming out with more games of this type.

I was remotely involved with some part of this game (localization) and was somewhat looking forward to it, but I feared the worst. I won't call this game a really bad game, and I have only played about 1 hour, but this is what I think nevertheless:

I have played Galactic Civ 2, Endless Space and others. I found none of them extremely satisfying and perfect. Good games in some areas, lacking in others. Lords of the Black Sun I think is not doing anything better than those games and that in my eyes makes it an immediate failure.

The empire management is tread of the mill. Manage gold, health, reputation blabla. Low health on a planet? Build a health center, build a police station vs crime. Build a factory to produce faster, build a tech lab to research faster, build colony ships, colonize planets, rinse & repeat the same meaningless ""choices""...You have a few building slots, but if you can only choose between 5 or 6 buildings, all of which fulfill exactly one role, this is pretty boring. 

Economy: Visit planets and establish trade routes...yea. There are some interesting concepts like immigration and laws you can establish, but again, those seem shallow I'm afraid...90% of the population want free speech, better give it to them before they rebel and take away your planet.

The map and moving units is ok I guess, but you get easily lost, because at max zoom icons are no longer displayed. Graphics are neither very pretty nor extremely bad for such a game. Ship models look like shit on the galaxy map though.

Diplomacy? Nothing new here, either. 10 minutes after meeting the first race they already demand a fifth or your total gold in tribute...cmon that is the easy AI. I already loathed that in Civ games.

You can also hire ministers and generals...ok. Those cost money and improve your empire in one way or the other...oook

Ship design...design...yea. You seem to have 4 different hulls at your disposal from the very beginning. The game wouldn't bother telling you that unless you click on the ship design icon (otherwise you only have a scout, an army ship and a colony ship). You can then proceed to build a light, medium, heavy or capital hull. The stronger hulls can of course take more punishment. You can then outfit those hulls with meaningless weapons (beam, plasma and missiles) as well as an engine, some armor and shields and 1 module. Your capital ship has 1 engine, 1 module, 2 armor and 4 weapon slots. No way to customize those slots I think? It does not matter where I would put my weapons, only the range and damage are affected by the weapon type, so generally build lots of ships with rockets and position your heavies with lots of armor and beam or plasma before them...research stronger weapons, replace them...nooooooo cmooooon. That is so boring. ""Oh, I now have plasma weapons II...yay"". Time to replace all my ship designs with the new weapons (I think, otherwise why would there be obsolete designs?). 

Research is a chore. My 2nd tier research already took 50 months (Maybe I wasn't building enough colony ships and research centers, but on the other hand you are not supposed to colonize at will, because it will stretch your resources and your defensive capabilities thin, and because colonization is boring. The research trees are pretty linear and nothing interesting either. They don't offer much, but every tier takes long to research. You have the usual stuff in there. 

There are barely any options in the game at all, which is another gripe of mine. Also the fonts are fucking small in 1920x1080 and you apparently can't make them bigger.

So, you basically build meaningless buildings, meaningless ships and research meaningless things and then you have your scout fly through a meaningless universe that looks all so very tidy and you discover your AI partners and yadda yadda yadda. In the one hour I was able to play this game all I did was basically ""End turn"", because there is just nothing meaningful to do. Maybe later on you will have to micro manage more, but it just all seems so generic and bland.

Last bit, combat: Who the fuck thought of that? It is a hex and turn based combat system with shitty graphics and animations and no great depth to it either. It's playing Heroes of Might and Magic in space with only a hand ful of units. And there is just no weight behind the combat. You fire a beam weapon and you barely register it. Missiles have at least a little bit of impact, but with only 3 different weapon types (all available from the beginning), this is bound to get boring after 2-3 battles.

I know I should have played longer to offer a good review, so please don't take my word for it, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. It all seemed so pointless :( Endless space (despite the silly auto combat) and Galactic Civ seem way better than this, so why bother? Also, the game has like 15 achievements and I unlocked half of them within 1 hour. Is this maybe indicative of the game content? There is only Single Player and Multi Player, no scenarios, no campaign apparently. I just cannot recommend it.","Soooo, Lords of the Black Sun.

-The Mechanics: One of the Game Defining Mechanics is how the production works. It works on a global level. Meaning each planet generates global production. If you colonize a second planet the production from the main planet will therefore sink as it's not the only ""receiver"" anymore. In addition you speed up the production massively with each factory you build. It's almost like reducing the time by half with each factory, which makes no sense. This way you spent a couple of turns building factories, then you design your combat ship, create a couple of them, and kill one ""very hard"" opponent after the other.

The Global mechanics also kill the feeling of having ""special planets"". Each planet is just contributing a bit to the ""geater good"". But that doesn't feel good.
While the game features tactical combat it's not planned out well and as the AI does not focus fire on your ships it will always lose when having troops with even strength.

This game is not terrible - just very very bland.

You will not find anything really new in here - all of it exists in other, better made games such as Distant Worlds or GalCiv2.

There are still some major bugs that have not been taken out - I can't even open the trade menu without a crash to desktop.

Ship design is weak - from the start, you get 4 hulls that go from tiny to small - with only no improvements available to increase what you can fit in them. The techs for ships don't provide any options - the missiles, beams and lasers are essentially the same. There are no fighters or bases.

Tactical fights are available but not terribly exciting - nor does it provide any depth as all weapons are in essence identical.

Many of the ""management tools"" are absent or in very basic form - you can't rearrange build queues, set up rally points, understand how much science, industry, or trade any particular action is going to generate. It's weird how you have to close an empire menu before opening the next one rather than switching between them.

The tech tree is pretty minimal - maybe 50-60 items in total. It gets boring in the 2nd part where you get solid lines of 3-4 consecutive ""industry +1"" or ""research +1"". It rarely opens up new abilities, just improves your starting ones.

Minor races have no interaction, except for pirates. You can send a trade ship there, tho with the game maxing out at 4 trade lines, it's not clear why you should bother.

What is working in this game is relatively fine. It just seems like they ran out of time to fine-tune and tweak the content in fun and interesting ways. Perhaps updates wil improve this solid, but it is currently an extremely bland X4 experience.

Verdict - unless you are scrapping the bottom of the barrel for x4 games, skip until a few updates.

Начиная от бесконечных перемещений кораблей (при записи/загрузке игры), отсутствии возможности создавать флоты и управлять ими, заканчивая строго зашитой мизерной разрешенной массой для этих самых кораблей. От самого начала игры можно строить корабли любой величины, до капитальных включительно, и до конца игры (до разгадывания всех технологий, которых, собственно, кот наплакал) эти корабли будут иметь наглухо зашитую массу. Так что, все слоты на корабле вам никогда не удастся заполнить. Особенно, учитывая, что чем дальше в лес тем больше весят модули и тем меньше от них (модулей) пользы. Совершенно никакие модули для кораблей, не выполняющие никакой смысловой нагрузки. Идиотская система сбора обломков (Какой бы защищенный и оснащенный по последнему, стоит отметить, слабенькому, слову техники корабль не проверял бы обломки, всегда есть 100% шанс, что корабль будет уничтожен, если в обломках окопаются злые пираты).
Отдельного упоминания стоит убогая дипломатия. Когда по 15 раз за год предлагают построить у вас свое посольство, ничего не предлагая взамен, оно начинает немного напрягать. Причем отказы никак не влияют на отношение.","I've played this game and I have this to say: It's complete crap. For now. There's still six months' worth of work to be done, ironing out a huge pile of bugs. This starts with endless ship relocations (when saving/loading a game), the inability to create and manage fleets, and ends with the strictly enforced, paltry mass limit for these ships. From the very beginning of the game, you can build ships of any size, including capital ships, and until the end of the game (until you've unlocked all the technologies, which are, frankly, a handful), these ships will have a completely locked mass limit. So, you'll never be able to fill all the slots on your ship. Especially considering that the further you go into the forest, the heavier the modules become, and the less useful they are. Absolutely useless ship modules, serving no purpose whatsoever. The idiotic wreckage recovery system (no matter how well protected and equipped with the latest (though admittedly weak) technology a ship is when inspecting wreckage, there's always a 100% chance it will be destroyed if evil pirates dig in).
The pathetic diplomacy deserves a special mention. When they offer to build their embassy in your country 15 times a year without offering anything in return, it starts to get a bit annoying. And refusals don't change the relationship at all."

-/- the major races are restrictive, and doesn't include any customization option at the start up.
-/+ instead there is a slight reimagining of ""Domestic Polocies"" that can further define and charactarize your empire, you can change them during the game and alter some aspects slightly - but there are pros and cons to them and often a particular race will just prefer a certain setup.

-/- the universe is limited, with little options outside colonizing a few planets you can take, and attack or occupy others. There isn't much interaction with the universe as a whole outside it being a static generation from the start. Perhaps I was spoiled with Space Empire's abiolities to drastically reform the universe even while in the game, but here its marginal.
-/- even with another strike against it is the ""neutral"" races or ""pirates"" which are just a bit more than just target practice and nuciances occupying a planet you want.

-/- the diplomacy feels shallow. I am sorry, its just not as in depth as I have seen others - it can be altered to get there sure, but as it stands I don't see it shifting to that. Many of the diplomacy options require facility constructions that will limit your options on the planets you own, and some options won't happen unless you or the other race have room to invest, further limiting who is really benefitting.

-/- the tactical turn based combat is restrictive as hell. You only get to do so much per turn, and each ship is further limited by its loadout. Multiple loadout designs with different weapon types or perks limits the ship's ability to function as you can only do one per turn, making the combat really limited in scope to the design and swarming of a few cheap ship creations of a doubled weapon or three.

-/- this further falls under the ship construction as there are limited sizes and options for what can be loaded on which ship. It limits design and role choices heavily.

+/- the genreals are a cool idea that develop as you use them, but the risk and reward are staggering comparisions. Due to the combat being so restrictive there isn't much for strategic desings possible and the random generation of the generals is flawed at times - they may have an attack power, but without a type given so it doesn't work. The development of them can be cool, and it directly affects their strengths, however the combat risk can easily leave them out on a limb and you'll loose all your progress.

-/+ the unrest aspect is interesting, but difficult to cause and easy to avoid, making it a moot issue that rarely surfaces unless you let or make it.

-/+ further deplomacy aspects sound cool as well, but the AI is fineky on its choices making its fulfuilment in many regards challenging, or just a question of finaces. A good economy can basically buy allies in most cases wtih a bit of espionage fixing.

-/- the AI cheats. I'm sorry, it does. It doesn't do something its not confident it can win, making it more hesitant and dulling the gameplay. Set up safe enough even with cheap ships and you'll never be threatened as you grow until you amass that army to just wipe everything out.

The first time I played I loaded up on as many AI opponents as I could and a huge galaxy. I made one attack on a pirate faction and then every race hated me and started going to war with me. I was also experiencing some learning curve set-backs, so I quit out of that game and started a new one. 

Round 2 I went with just 2 alien AI opponents, in a small galaxy, and tried just making nice with them. We claimed our planets, established trade routes, built stuff.... 5 hours later nothing had happened. I was basically just making the same colony ships over and over, going to new planets, building the same buildings... My population was happy, my enemies were all happy, I had more money than I knew what to do with. The game kind of just devolved into a management of the empires finances and construction. 

This game is really lacking from random events that spice up your experience. They attempted by puting in 'disasters' which is basically just a simple: 'pay money and keep people happy' or 'Tell your people you wont help them and piss everyone off'. Its a pretty shallow wildcard system. 

The interface is clean, but is also very lacking. For example, when looking at what buildings are on a planet, only the 'build menu' has the names of the buildings and what they do. The buildings you already have in place do not have names, and you cannot click on them to see if they are being effective in any way. So you have to do a cross reference on what the buildings look like to even know what you have built... 

And on the subject of building, its super boring. I'm sure I would eventually get to more advanced structures down the tech tree, but in the 5-8 hours I played Puting the same combination of 5-10 buildings on 20 different planets was about as much fun as organizing a deck of cards. Also it seems when you do unlock better versions of buildings, you need to go BACK to all of those planets, destroy a building, and put in the upgrade. Its not automatic. 

So when you are 20 hours down the line in this game and you wonder why every race has a better economy than you, it might be because you forgot to upgrade 5 of your 40 planets to better factories... better go check them all... one... by... one.... 

While I cant recomend this game I hope that the developers learn from this one and make a sequel with the holes filled in.

When you begin playing the gmae, you are presented with a beatiful represenation of the galaxy you have chosen (You can customize this galaxy in certain ways as well) and as you venture further into creating the strongest galactic empire possible, you begin to see the possibilities that could be implemented, knowing that this is currently early access. The game really draws you in and you start to wonder which way you want your empire to go, and the game gives you many ways to go. It does this through their social policy system, where you are presented with different social policies and how your citizens feel about them.  These attitudes will change over time and you will have to decide whether to legalize slavery or keep it banned (for example). The game also has a unique addition that really allows you to decide the , lets say attitude, of your empire and it is ship design. At the start, you have 3 pre-set ships, scout, colony ship and army ship. The army ship is only transport, so the game urges you to create your own battleship and in the process, you start planning your own ships. For example, after researching intergalactic trade, you will need to create a tradeship, so you would need to add a trading module and an engine, but you then need to decide whether armour or weapons would serve more of a purpose, as the trade modul weighs  a good 30 tonnes. This is just one example of the many aspects that makes Lords of the Black Sun a brilliant game with a bright future. I would strongly recommend this game.","This game has a real bright future, for a number of reasons too.

三回もやり直してるけど、現状じゃこれ以上はもうむりぽ

追記：
なんだかんだで５回やり直してなんとかクリアした感想という愚痴をココに書きます。

セーブデータが頻繁に壊れる、整合性がとれずにCTD
初期化できずにCTD、戦闘突入時に敵の艦隊がＰＣ側として読み込まれてCTD
敵の将軍が読み込まれてバグってフリーズする、特定の日付で敵が攻め込んでくるとCTD、特定の日付で敵を攻める・宙域で戦闘を行うとCTD
特定の座標で戦闘するとCTD、惑星を占領するとCTD、艦隊が何故か増えて次のターンでCTD、生産された艦隊が消滅してCTD
ＮＰＣ、ＰＣの支配惑星・艦隊らが共に消滅しCTD、
セーブした瞬間（オートセーブ含む）にCTD
ゲーム中にロードするとCTD (但し、一度ゲームを中断してタイトルからロードすれば落ちないが、今度はセーブデータがロード出来なくなる事がある）
数ターン前のセーブデータ・オートセーブがロード出来ずに積む
などと苦痛しか味わえない稀代のマゾゲ。




ゲームとしてはマップの拡大縮小が大雑把で使いづらい、
艦隊の行き先がＡ点→Ｂ点までしか指示できずに複数の艦隊を運用する上で使い難い
すべての技術を完成させても入植できない惑星がある。
小型艦・中型艦・大型艦・主力艦という区切りはあるが、空母の概念、攻撃する方向によりダメージや命中率が変化するなどの概念がない為、戦闘が単調でつまらない。
特殊装備の使いどころがない。（全艦艇ミサイル装備して突っ込ませておけば大体勝てる）
自動戦闘のバランスがおかしい（hp:20,arm:9 主力艦 x 8 vs hp:11,arm:0 中型艦 x 2 で主力艦側が全滅など)
傭兵として使役する将軍の存在が微妙（艦をアップグレード出来ないので最初は盾に使えても中盤では弾除けにすらならない）

ようやくクリアしたが、エンディング的なものはおろか
クレジットすら出ないとは、、あっさりしてます。

現在のバージョンでは金と時間の無駄使いです、まだCapcomのつまらんゾンビゲの方がマシ。","Debugging errors, errors, errors.
The game crashes when loading, freezes during battle, freezes after defeating enemies,
endless loading times, and sometimes even crashes. It's so buggy, I can't help but wonder if they even debugged it.

It has a similar feel to the legendary game Imperium Galactica 2, but...
I was really looking forward to it. (It's full of fatal bugs that make me hate playing it lol.)
If there's no update, it'll just be a masochistic game, right? (It's not a crappy game.)
I bought it for $19.99, but even $3 seems like a bit much.
I've tried it three times, and at this point, I'm not ready to play any more.

PS:
After five tries, I finally managed to complete it, so here's my rant and my thoughts.

Save data frequently corrupts, crashes due to inconsistency
Crashes when unable to initialize, crashes when enemy fleet is loaded as PC's when entering battle
Bugs and freezes when enemy general is loaded, crashes when enemy attacks on a specific date, crashes when attacking enemy or fighting in space on a specific date
Crashes when fighting at specific coordinates, crashes when occupying a planet, fleets somehow increase and crashes the next turn, CTD when produced fleets disappear
Crashes when NPCs, PC's controlled planets, and fleets all disappear,
Crashes the moment you save (including autosaves)
Crashes when loading during the game (however, if you pause the game and load from the title screen, it doesn't crash, but then save data sometimes won't load)
Save data from a few turns ago and autosaves won't load, leaving the game stuck
This is a rare masochistic game that's nothing but painful.

As a game, the map's zoom is rough and difficult to use.
Fleets can only be directed from point A to point B, making it difficult to operate multiple fleets.
There are planets that cannot be colonized even after all technologies have been perfected.
While there are divisions into small, medium, large, and capital ships, there's no concept of aircraft carriers or how damage or hit rate changes depending on the direction of attack, making battles monotonous and boring.
Special equipment is not used. (If you equip all ships with missiles and let them charge, you'll usually win.)
Auto-combat is unbalanced (e.g., 8 capital ships with 20 HP and 9 Armor vs. 2 medium ships with 11 HP and 0 Armor resulting in the capital ships being completely wiped out).
The generals employed as mercenaries are questionable (ships can't be upgraded, so while they may be useful as shields at first, they don't even offer much protection in the middle of the game).

I finally completed the game, but there's no ending, not even a credit...that's so simple.

The current version is a waste of money and time, I'd rather play Capcom's boring zombie game."

This is definately alpha. The UI and graphics belong on a VIC20 out of the 80's. Not 'any' modern game. The advertising material and wall paper images selling the game are grossly misleading. Frankly my 1st impressions is that this is yet another rip off game cashing in on the genre without putting in a real effort. Even at alpha stage I am very dissappointed and extremely dubious. At this time I think that this game is a complete crash and burn.","1st impresisons.

Star Lords, by Arkavi Studios and Iceberg Interactive is a deep and complex turn based 4x sci-fy strategy game. This is about the only informations you get from the get-go once you boot the game for the first time. Once you start a new game, you will be asked to select from a group of 8 original races and customise the ""game board"".

Once the game begins, you'll immediately take control of your chosen race and you can start using your scout ship to explore your surroundings. You also get a home planet, which will be  used as a main hub for initial development.

The game leaves a pretty good first impression, with very nice and clean graphical information. The UI is functional and simple, but can become a bit overwhelming for starters, but all in all everything is pretty intuitive. But, being this an alpha build, i must stress the importance of the creation of a structured tutorial, so players can learn and try the base mechanics before being sent into the wild.

Once the game starts building up pace, you will meet other civilizations, which you will need to either crush with military prowess or outsmart through diplomacy and espionage. Overall, the AI is pretty solid, even though other races can be tad temperamental towards your actions 

The game map, even though presented in a very simplistic fashion, works very well and offers a ton of graphical variety. Planets look pretty good, and so does spacial debris and other celestial bodies, such as moons and stars.

The game still lacks a bit of clear indicative elements, such as an ""it is now your turn"" prompt, or some audio feedback on research completion but, as it is in alpha, hopefully these elements will be added at some point.

Veredict: There is room for a lot of improvement, specially in the fine details, but as this is just an alpha build, i will be eagerly expecting the finished product, and i am glad to be supporting it!","Star Lords Alpha Build - Pre-release Review
