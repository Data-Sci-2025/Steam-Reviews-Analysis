Now, there are some games that are in early access and pretty nice. They might have some graphical issues or multiplayer issues. And you can usually get the point of the game. Im having a hard time trying to figure out what im supposed to be doing in Damned Nation. Im supposed to build this ""Home Hub"" which takes materials that you need to gather. But the only thing you can harvest is wood and stone. You need to loot the metal and fuel. And the only loot that spawns is in garbage cans and broken vehicles. There are houses that you can enter, but they are really really dark and there is never anything in them. Once the Home Hub was placed (finally) this huge blue aura appears. Then you can start building turrets within it. So I place one (after running all around looting every car in sight) and it doesn't work. I lured 3 zeds in  front of it and it did nothing. The zeds just beat the shit out of it. There is a power counter that appears in the top left corner, but you are never told how you are supposed to turn on the turrets. So at this point, I was lost. So I stopped.   The lack of direction is probably the biggest downfall this game currently.

And when it comes to killing things..im not sure where im supposed to be hitting the zeds. The hit boxes appear to be completely random. I could be standing right in front of one gettin my face chewed off while I swing my axe at it, but 95% of the time you do no damage. So I just ran and jumped around them. Even tho there is a leveling system, I felt no desire to stand around and try to kill zombies. 

SO, at the games current state I can't recommend it. I love my survival games but the survival mode in this just isn't there. And there is too much lack of direction or information to keep it from being frustrating. 

And once again, I know this is early access, and I know what I was getting into when I bought this.","Let me start off my saying, I am no stranger to Early Access games. I know what im buying and I know what to expect. 

Now, there are some games that are in early access and pretty nice. They might have some graphical issues or multiplayer issues. And you can usually get the point of the game. Im having a hard time trying to figure out what im supposed to be doing in Damned Nation. Im supposed to build this ""Home Hub"" which takes materials that you need to gather. But the only thing you can harvest is wood and stone. You need to loot the metal and fuel. And the only loot that spawns is in garbage cans and broken vehicles. There are houses that you can enter, but they are really really dark and there is never anything in them. Once the Home Hub was placed (finally) this huge blue aura appears. Then you can start building turrets within it. So I place one (after running all around looting every car in sight) and it doesn't work. I lured 3 zeds in  front of it and it did nothing. The zeds just beat the shit out of it. There is a power counter that appears in the top left corner, but you are never told how you are supposed to turn on the turrets. So at this point, I was lost. So I stopped.   The lack of direction is probably the biggest downfall this game currently.

Das Spiel wird leidernicht mehr weiter geführt. ist noch auf dem selben stand wie ich es damals gekauft habe. Schade drum, aber leider keine seltenheit.


Von 2015

Das ganze spiel läuft bis her sehr gut.
Der TD modus selber ist ehr lahm da die Gegener nur gerade aus laufen und man so nicht wirklich zusehen muss wo man die Tower hinstellt.

Der eigendliche Teile des Spiel ist mal etwas erfrischend.
Man kämpft in der Ego Perspektive und muss 3 Punkte verteidigen.
Momentan kann man seine Tower oder barikaden mit EXP Bauen und seine Gesundheit kann man mit dem Töten von Tieren auffüllen.
Das ganze ist derzeit eine Runde sache, Bugs usw sind natürlich vorhanden, aber für eine Alpha läuft es besser wie manch Fertige spiele von anderen Abietern.

Der Multiplayermodus ist im Aufbau, man kann zwar ne runde spielen drinnen aber ist oft alleine ^^

Für den preis eine gute sache und bisher macht es mir großen spass.","From summer 2017
Unfortunately, the game is no longer being developed. It's still at the same level as when I bought it. It's a shame, but unfortunately, it's not uncommon.

From 2015

The whole game is running very well so far.
The TD mode itself is rather slow, as the enemies only run straight ahead, so you don't really have to watch where you're placing your towers.

The actual part of the game is somewhat refreshing.
You fight in first-person perspective and have to defend three points.
Currently, you can build your towers or barricades with EXP, and you can replenish your health by killing animals.
The whole thing is currently a round-robin affair; there are, of course, bugs, etc., but for an alpha, it's running better than some finished games from other providers.

The multiplayer mode is still under development. You can play a round indoors, but you're often alone. ^^

It's a good deal for the price, and I'm having a lot of fun with it so far."

In short, the game is most certainly not worth $13 at the present time.  There is only one game mode available and the game doesn't do a very good job in informing the player on how to actually play the game.  Yes, I did read the manual on the official website and while it tells you to hit ""T"" for turret and hit ""1"", ""2"", etc. to select your turret, it does not tell you how to actually place it.  All I get is the outline of the object with no indication on what to do next.  The hit-boxes are a bit off, especially with the shotgun...a zombie, in theory, should go down after five shots at point blank range.  The visuals are coming along nicely, though this game clearly needs more work.
