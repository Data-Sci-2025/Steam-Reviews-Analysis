Heard about this little game online and checked it out a bit ago. It's a little point A to point B type of game while inspecting items along the way. It's a quick little game but very artistic and expressive. The music is good but repetitive, but I didn't particularly mind such a thing. It carries such a weird experience that is entirely intentional and overall adds to the experience. It follows a human named Petal and a robot named Bios. The story doesn't take too long to get started and gets grim, but along the way Petal and Bios comment on their world that invokes a feeling of surreal teenage familiarity.

Overall, I really recommend it for the unique art style alone I appreciated my time with it and it's unique feelings. I hope that if you see this review, you give it a chance.

195242170,english,2025.04.20 03:10,✅,✅,0.5128205419,1,"This is a game that is clearly a deeply artistic and personal endeavour by its creator. There’s little gameplay innovation present, it plays like a very simple point-and-click adventure game. But what it lacks in mechanical complexity, it more than makes up for in style. 

The visuals are a unique blend of hand-drawn, paper character models on backgrounds composed of real photographs, presumably from near where the creator lives in real life. These create a distinct, personal feel to the game that few games can match, especially visually. The sound design is limited, but what little music is available is quite catchy, whilst also reinforcing the mood of the game.

That mood, or at least the one I get from the game, is about being a teenager. The narrative presented in the game gets pretty grim, but it is juxtaposed with the main characters casually observing their environment, commenting on little things they see and how they feel/think on topics. This provides some much needed levity in the midst of a grim tale. It won’t take too long to unravel, as the game is only about half an hour long. There are multiple endings to pursue, so there is a small amount of replay value to be had.

Overall, even though the game is extremely short, I appreciated my time with it. It has a unique, teenage feel to it that’s not as common as it was in the past (I think of the golden era of Flash games, but you may think of another time). For vibes alone, I would gladly recommend this game.","This is a game that is clearly a deeply artistic and personal endeavour by its creator.

Was the final thoughts I was left with as I clicked off the game to write this review. The story starts itself in the throws of crises between two friends; a robot and a human. A world in regression, a soul haunted, and a soul near the cusp of breaking.

A troubled human, and a troubled robot. Both incapable of protecting themselves and forced to watch as each other suffers as well.

A phenomenal story I would recommend to anyone.

Персонажі намальовані в дусі намальованих персонажів у шкільному альбомі, а бекграунди складаються з фото, зроблених на стару камеру (нагадує за якістю фотоплівки палароїду), де нам показують місто, яке, я і усе що з ним пов'язано, намагаються покинути головні герої - Petal і людино-робота Bios.

Сюжет зачіпає проблеми шкільного булінгу і, як на мене, дегуманізації меншинств, поданих у вигляді, я не іронічно, ЛЮДИНО-роботів. 

Робота композитора неймовірна - треки одночасно грамотні і звучать дуже ""гаражно"". Дуже гарно понурює в атмосферу гри і спогади про підліткові часи. Як композиторка, я зробила собі пару нотаток для власних саундтреків.

I think the artistic visual presentation here is one of the highlights and is what ultimately drew me into this novel, but I think the story being told here is truly beautiful and unique. I don't want to be too intrusive, but I can really feel the author's (Riley<9) soul and history here. I won't say any more than that but this is a very human work and I really do appreciate its existence. Despite how short this novel is I think it is very powerful and it incorporates a lot of mechanics that drive home its presentation incredibly well. The music intentionally invokes a nostalgic atmosphere but its done so well. Giving away the OST for free really is a treat, thank you so much.
I will say, I relate quite heavily to Petal and feel pretty seen after having finished. I wish I could’ve read this when I was still in high school. Thank you Riley for creating this game, you are a beautiful person and I'd love to see what you create next <3

Actually, I really liked the vibes, the visuals slightly reminded me of Purgo Box, and even though it looks a bit trashy, it does feel somewhat intentional and self-aware, if anything it complements the weird experience. Very much feels like an arthouse project with the video clips and the cutouts walking against the photos.

I could not find the last 2 achievements, but the game is about 25 minutes for one playthrough if you reading all of the optional text, with about 60 minutes of content if you really wanted to try and get all of the choices. There are a few different outcomes, I managed to find 3 which might be all of them. I will say that I liked the contrast between the good and the bad ending, kind of a nice effect you did there with the video speed on the clips, capturing either despair or hope depending on the choices. 

There were a few technical issues, you can potentially softlock yourself because of the character pathing. If you want to avoid that, make sure you just do what the game wants you to do, find the star on the screen, and walk toward it, if you don't you might get stuck somewhere. I assume the content of the game is sampled from various sources and not all manually crafted, but I do think you made an interesting experience with it.

The narrative is simple but relatable, if you ever had any issues at school, or perhaps you know someone that has, this happens all the time, being bullied by a kid, and for some, it gets to a point where they can't take it anymore. The game is about leaving your old life behind, and starting a new one, if you can.

[h1] Pros: [/h1]

(+) Even though the game may appear to be put together with a tape, I think the  narrative still works, if you into arthouse vibes and psychedelic mood that is. Normally I would not like music like that, but it complements the odd feel of the game overall.

(+) The narrative was not very complex, but I liked the contrast between the good and the bad ending, that sound Q on the last stretch of video clips, I think it does a good job giving the closure to where the character ends up emotionally. 

[h1] Feedback: [/h1]

The game has some potential softlocks with the pathing, mainly because you have 2 character that can walk at different distance, early in the game I got stuck walking toward the camera, second or third scene I think, I am sure you can do it other places as well.

[b] Overall Thoughts: 7/10 [/b]

I like the resourcefulness, putting a somewhat unique experience with just about nothing, just some random photos and random clips. I would prefer if you do everything yourself, like if you sourced all of the assets manually instead of using whatever you found, that way I can give more credit to the game, but overall I still liked the vibes in the game, short but not a bad psychedelic experience.
