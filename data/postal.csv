I just hope one day it actually DOES get a remake (which is unlikely), since I'd love to see the game that they wanted it to be fully realized.

207380884,russian,2025.09.23 16:20,✅,✅,0.5,0,"Postal 3... Ну, про неё много плохого говорят, и, честно говоря, есть за что. Но есть в ней одна фишка, которая меня прям зацепила. Это возможность пройти игру, вообще никого не убивая!

Представь себе: ты – Чувак из Postal, известный своей жестокостью и любовью к насилию, и ты... сажаешь цветочки. Серьезно, там есть такая возможность! И не только цветочки. Ты можешь помогать старушкам переходить через дорогу, делать добрые дела и вообще быть хорошим парнем.

Это полный разрыв шаблона! В Postal, где все только и делают, что стреляют и взрывают, ты можешь быть пацифистом. Это, конечно, немного криво реализовано, и иногда игра сама подталкивает к насилию. Но сама идея – просто огонь!

Так что если ты хочешь увидеть Postal с другой стороны, если тебе интересно, как бы Чувак вёл себя, будучи хорошим, то Postal 3 может тебя удивить. Но помни: это всё ещё Postal 3, так что баги, кривой юмор и прочие прелести никуда не делись. Но, блин, возможность стать самым добрым Чуваком в мире Postal – это дорогого стоит! Высший пилотаж: Уникальная возможность пройти игру в режиме ""пацифиста"": сажая цветочки, никого не трогая и переводя старушек через улицы!","Postal 3... Well, it gets a lot of bad press, and honestly, there's a reason for that. But there's one feature that really got me. It's the ability to complete the game without killing anyone!

Imagine: you're the Dude from Postal, known for his cruelty and love of violence, and you... plant flowers. Seriously, you can do that! And not just flowers. You can help old ladies cross the street, do good deeds, and generally be a good guy.

It's a complete game changer! In Postal, where everyone's all about shooting and blowing things up, you can be a pacifist. It's a bit poorly implemented, of course, and sometimes the game itself encourages violence. But the idea itself is simply brilliant!

So if you want to see a different side of Postal, if you're interested in how the Dude would act if he were a good guy, then Postal 3 might surprise you. But remember: this is still Postal 3, so the bugs, quirky humor, and other delights are still there. But damn, the opportunity to become the kindest Dude in the Postal world is worth it! The ultimate: A unique opportunity to complete the game in ""pacifist"" mode: planting flowers, not bothering anyone, and helping old ladies cross the streets!"

Лично я по большей части хотела эту игру в коллекцию, ведь знала, что она говно, но ведь это не просто плохой Postal, это с очень большой натяжкой можно назвать игрой в принципе. Я не рекомендую качать это даже с торрента, не то что покупать.","This is as similar to Postal as slippers are to shoes. It's kind of the same thing, yet it's so different. Personally, I mostly wanted this game for my collection because I knew it was crap, but it's not just a bad Postal; it's a stretch to call it a game at all. I don't recommend downloading it even from a torrent, let alone buying it."

207340757,russian,2025.09.23 01:04,✅,✅,0.5,0,"Да в целом то очень даже неплохо, правда сюжет капец обрывистый, потому что с урезанием бюджета урезался и весь контент в игре, и игра больше ощущается как какая-то бета. Но если так взглянуть, если бы не все проблемы во время разработки, то эта игра могла бы стать очень достойной, у неё был реальный потенциал. Многие ошибочно думают, что постал 3 разрабатывали ноунеймы, и игра изначально была обречена на провал, но Акелла - это крупнейший издатель игр в России, у которых карманы рвались от денег, вот RWS и отдали им в руки всё создание игры. Они, маленькая инди-студия, отдали разработку большой компании. Естественно это предложение было выгодно, потому что оригинальные разработчики сделали только сюжет, а потом ждали деньги с продаж.

То есть, Винс Дези не настолько обдолбался кошачьей мятой, чтобы просрать свою линейку, отдав её аборигенам. Акелла на фоне running with scissors выглядела даже статуснее, да и бюджет у неё был раза в 3 больше, тк деньги со второй части у создателей вселенной заканчивались. И поначалу разработка шла хорошо, в свою дочернюю компанию trashmasters Акелла отправила на разработку профессионалов, если даже просто взглянуть на малочисленные кадры из бета-версии, то видно, что разработка шла полным ходом. И по сути большинство всех хороших аспектов у этой игры были созданы в начале разработки, а потом всё повалилось в бездну.

Всемирный экономический кризис, Акелла ещё вчера могла купить права на ещё сотни игр, но деньги резко исчезли. Пришлось закрыть кучу проектов, а разработка третьего постала встала на месте. Постепенно от безвыходности приходилось увольнять самых опытных разработчиков и нанимать новичков, которые, конечно, того былого опыта не имели. А RWS с Акеллой не общались вообще, обратной связи не было никакой, американцы знали только то, что разработка игры вроде как идёт, значит всё нармас. А про ад, творившийся у русских даже не догадывались. Большинство работников уходили добровольно, потому что зарплату им взять было неоткуда. Многие люди, которые разрабатывали игру последними, деньги за свою работу так и не получили.

И вот, игра вышла, её полили грязью, а rws, желая спасти игру, попросила у Акеллы хотя бы предоставить код от игры. Ну, ответа не последовало, отчего постал 3 навсегда и остался со статусом провала.

Но если вы сейчас захотите купить эту игру, то без проблем и, вероятно, даже без кучи вылетов и багов, пройдёте её от начала и до конца. Проблемы есть с ачивками, иногда, возможно, есть и баги, но я ни разу не сталкивался. В некоторых моментах игра вместе со всем остальным тупо зависала и не реагировала, приходилось через второй рабочий стол и диспетчер задач выключать и запускать заново. Игра вылетала, когда я пытался использовать кошку в ракетнице, а кошачья мята вообще в большинстве случаев не работала и тормозила всё вокруг. Всё остальное работало исправно, играть было вполне приятно. 

Шутки в игре есть довольно угарные, миссии пытались разнообразить, но в большинстве случаев вы зачищаете территорию. По персонажам зачастую вообще не понимаешь кто что зачем и вся такая хрень, потому что они тупо не раскрыты, я так и не понял [spoiler] нахрена дейв и мэр собирались взорвать бомбу [/spoiler]. Ближнее оружие вообще очень угарно работает, надо целиться левее на сантиметр от прицела, чтобы попасть.

Да и сами обещания для постал 3 были сильно преувеличены. RWS бы никогда не смогли сделать то, чего они заставили ждать от третьего постала фанатов, это подтверждает постал 4. Только четвертая часть вышла в 2022, а то, что в ней есть разрабы обещали сделать в нулевых.

Среди всех посталов тут лучшая графика, это единственная постал игра, где выбор влияет на сюжет, здесь лучшая моделька гг, многие катсцены тоже выглядят очень круто (особенно: это что за поебень в мою то смену). И играть интересно, на сегодняшний день главная фишка этой части - её кривость, над которой зачастую можно посмеяться. О! И саундтрек, он тут просто лучший. А ещё оружее. Барсук-бензопила это просто шедевр, пердящая пушка лучшее оружие для пацифиста, а моим любимым был пулемёт М-60  

Жаль что игра не доработана. Но из того, во что я сыграл мне всё понравилось.
 
В общем, rws за счёт третьего постала себе сейчас искусственно повышают репутацию. Типо, мы вот такого говна не делаем (постал 2 при обычном прохождении раньше вылетал чаще третьего). Видимо, rws уже совсем позабыли, как раньше яростно рекламировали постал 3 повсюду)","Overall, it's pretty good, although the plot is incredibly choppy because the budget cuts cut all the game's content, making it feel more like a beta. But if you look at it that way, if not for all the problems during development, this game could have been a very good one; it had real potential. Many people mistakenly think that Postal 3 was developed by no-names and that the game was doomed from the start, but Akella is the largest game publisher in Russia, and their pockets were bursting with cash, so RWS handed over the entire game's development to them. They, a small indie studio, handed over the development to a large company. Naturally, this offer was lucrative, because the original developers only created the plot and then waited for the money from sales.

So, Vince Dezi wasn't so high on catnip that he'd screw up his line by handing it over to the natives. Akella looked even more prestigious compared to Running with Scissors, and its budget was three times larger, as the creators of the universe were running out of money from the second game. And initially, development was going well; Akella sent professionals to its subsidiary, Trashmasters, to work on it. Even just looking at the few shots from the beta version, it's clear that development was in full swing. In fact, most of the game's good aspects were created early on, and then everything went down the drain.

The global economic crisis hit. Akella could have bought the rights to hundreds more games yesterday, but the money suddenly disappeared. A bunch of projects had to be shut down, and development of the third installment stalled. Gradually, out of desperation, they had to fire the most experienced developers and hire newcomers, who, of course, lacked the same experience. RWS had no communication with Akella at all, there was no feedback whatsoever. The Americans only knew that the game's development was progressing, meaning everything was fine. And they had no idea about the hell that was going on with the Russians. Most of the workers left voluntarily because they had nowhere to get paid. Many of the people who developed the game last never received their pay.

So, the game was released, it was vilified, and rws, wanting to save the game, asked Akella to at least provide the game code. Well, there was no response, which is why it got a 3rd place permanently and remained with a failure status.

But if you decide to buy this game now, you'll be able to play it from start to finish without any problems, and probably even without a bunch of crashes and bugs. There are some issues with achievements, and maybe there are bugs sometimes, but I've never encountered any. At times, the game, along with everything else, would simply freeze and become unresponsive, requiring me to shut it down through the second desktop and Task Manager and restart it. The game crashed when I tried to use the grappling hook with the rocket launcher, and the catnip didn't work at all most of the time, slowing everything down. Everything else worked fine, and it was quite enjoyable.

The jokes in the game are pretty hilarious, and they tried to add variety to the missions, but most of the time you're just clearing out the area. You often don't understand who's doing what and all that crap from the characters because they're so vaguely described. I still don't understand [spoiler] why Dave and the Mayor were planning to detonate the bomb. [/spoiler] The melee weapons are just hilarious; you have to aim a centimeter to the left of your crosshair to hit.

And the promises for Postal 3 were greatly exaggerated. RWS would never have been able to deliver what they led fans to expect from Postal 3, and Postal 4 confirms that. Postal 4 was released in 2022, and the developers promised to deliver what it contains in the 2000s.

Of all the postals, this one has the best graphics. It's the only postal game where choices affect the plot. It has the best character model, and many of the cutscenes look really cool (especially: what the fuck is this on my watch?). It's also fun to play. The main draw of this game is its clunkiness, which is often laughable. Oh! And the soundtrack, it's simply the best. And the weapons, too. The chainsaw badger is a masterpiece, the fart gun is the best weapon for a pacifist, and my favorite was the M-60 machine gun.

It's a shame the game isn't polished. But I liked everything I played.

Basically, RWS is artificially boosting its reputation with the help of Postal 3. Like, we don't make shit like this (Postal 2 used to crash more often than Postal 3 during a normal playthrough). Apparently, RWS has completely forgotten how they used to hype Postal 3 everywhere."

Вполне интересно играется, симпатично выглядит, шутки норм и реально отличная музыка, лично я проходил без скуки. Все засирают игру за управление, но как по мне все относительно нормально и проблем с управлением и прицелом не возникало, тряску при беге тоже ругают, но мне даже зашло. Игра выглядит стильно, особенно для того времени. Все что могу сказать из минусов, так это то, что она пару раз вылетала, но это все решалось просто сейвами, которые я вполне вовремя делал. Не вызвала при прохождении совсем никаких отрицательных эмоций, которые я ожидал в огромных количествах, начитавшись отзывов.","I don't understand what's so bad about this game that it has so many bad reviews. It's quite fun to play, looks nice, has decent jokes, and genuinely great music. I personally played through it without getting bored. Everyone criticizes the controls, but I found them to be relatively fine. I had no issues with aiming or controls. The shaking while running is also criticized, but I actually enjoyed it. The game looks stylish, especially for its time. The only downside I can think of is that it crashed a couple of times, but those were all resolved by simply saving, which I did just in time. It didn't evoke any negative emotions at all, which I expected in abundance after reading the reviews."

Вам необходимо перейти в корневую папку с игрой. Если вы не знайте как это сделать, то вам нужно зайти в Библиотеку в Steam ➔ нажать правой кнопкой мыши по иконке POSTAL III ➔ выбрать свойства ➔ нажать на кнопку, установленные файлы ➔ после чего нажать обзор.

После нужно зайти в папку P3 ➔ CFG ➔ и открыть через блокнот или другой текстовый редактор файл «autoexec.cfg».

После вы найдёте там строчку под названием «host_thread_mode», в которой вам необходимо заменить цифру 2, на 0. И после этого достижения будут работать как и работали до патча.

Если что гайд не мой, сразу извиняюсь","[h1]The game isn't bad, but here's what I recommend doing right away to get achievements:[/h1]

You need to go to the game's root folder. If you don't know how to do this, go to your Steam Library ➔ right-click the POSTAL III icon ➔ select Properties ➔ click Installed Files ➔ then click Browse.

Next, go to the P3 folder ➔ CFG ➔ and open the ""autoexec.cfg"" file in Notepad or another text editor.

You'll find a line there called ""host_thread_mode,"" in which you need to replace the number 2 with 0. After that, the achievements will work as they did before the patch.

206567663,russian,2025.09.12 21:15,✅,✅,0.4761904776,0,"В этом отзыве постараюсь ответить на главные и насущные вопросы: стоит ли вообще покупать постал 3? Так ли он плох? Сразу скажу что игра средняя, ни хорошо, ни плохо. Порекомендовал только потому что нет выбора между да и нет. Перейдем к самой игре.
Плюсы: графика, обновленный интерфейс, офигенные саундтреки, прикольные модельки. Возможность выбирать на чью сторону встать, наличие выбора линии сюжета. Понравилось раздавать хедшоты. Не приходится вечно бегать по карте, игрока телепортируют куда нужно каждый раз. В общем и целом хороший визуал.
Минусы: отстойные хитбоксы, не ощущаемая тяжесть нанесения ударов (т.е. просто удар и ничего более, к примеру с той же кувалдой в постале 2 дела обстояли намного лучше. Некоторое оружие вообще смысла нет использовать по причине своей багованости, хитбоксов и дамага. Одним из таких является мачете, во второй части оно было одним из моих самых любимых, в этой же наоборот, его все также можно кинуть бумерангом, однако как это сделано...ууу. Мало того что оно может просто не нанести весомого урона, так и движется нереально медленно, большинство непесей успеют перебежать на другой конец карты. То же касается и возвращения его в руку, перед тем как полететь назад, оно будет рикошетить по половине карты чисто по приколу. Так ещё и возвращение в руку отменяется всем попало. Ещё одним минусом посчитаю отсутствие многих саунд эффектов, за которые реально обидно. Хитбоксы (в особенности на оружии ближнего боя) просто нереально тупые, той же кувалдой можно промахнуться по нпс раза 3 подрядб Некоторые оружия сделаны халтурно: та же кувалда, крови при ударах почти нет, на альт атаке вообще чувак просто крутится с кувалдой и сбивает кто попадет под руку, причем без звуков. Очень упущенный потенциал. Миссии не сказал бы что плохие, просто кажется, что во второй части сюжет подавали более бодро, поэтому почти ни одна миссия не смогла порадовать или удивить. Пинок тоже разочаровал. Хитбоксы плохие, Ле впритык попадаешь, так ещё и станит на месте после самого пинка, что дико бесит, смысла его использовать, кроме как выбивать двери нет, по врагу тяжелее попасть, когда он на полу или поднимается, там более учитывая что после пинка ещё и добавляется стан. С катсценами все стабильно. Говно. Неуместный всплывающий текст, который со временем начинает бесить, к этому счастью ещё наваливают эффект старого кино, что вообще как по мне не к месту. Помимо этого сами катсцены лаганые и как будто графа в них хуже чем в самой игре.  Иногда из-за тупости нпс не можешь пройти миссию сразу (нападение бомжей на участок, побег из тюрьмы, эскорт слейв боя из здания). 
Итог: Игра ни хороша, но и не плоха. Советую брать игру на распродаже (лично купил за 70 рублей), если есть желание поиграть, несмотря на сомнительные отзывы.","In this review, I'll try to answer the main and pressing questions: is Postal 3 worth buying? Is it really that bad? I'll say right away that the game is average, neither good nor bad. I only recommended it because it's hard to choose between yes and no. Let's move on to the game itself.
Pros: graphics, updated interface, awesome soundtrack, cool models. The ability to choose your side, and the choice of storylines. I enjoyed giving headshots. You don't have to constantly run around the map; you're teleported to the right place every time. Overall, good visuals. Cons: crappy hitboxes, no real sense of heaviness when dealing blows (i.e. just a blow and nothing more, for example with the same sledgehammer in post-game 2 things were much better. Some weapons are completely pointless to use due to their buggy hitboxes and damage. One of these is the machete, in the second part it was one of my favorites, in this one, on the contrary, you can still throw it like a boomerang, but how it is done... ugh. Not only can it simply not deal significant damage, but it moves incredibly slowly, most of the enemy will have time to run to the other end of the map. The same applies to returning it to your hand, before flying back, it will ricochet half the map purely for fun. And also the return to hand is canceled for everyone. Another disadvantage I consider the lack of many sound effects, which is a real shame. Hitboxes (especially on melee weapons) The combat is just incredibly stupid, you can miss an NPC 3 times in a row with the same sledgehammer. Some weapons are poorly made: the sledgehammer, for example, there's almost no blood when hitting, and on the alt attack, the guy just spins around with the sledgehammer and knocks down anyone in his path, without any sounds. A huge waste of potential. I wouldn't say the missions are bad, it just seems like the second game handled the story more energetically, so almost no mission managed to please or surprise. The kick was also disappointing. The hitboxes are bad, you hit the Le right on target, and it stuns you in place after the kick itself, which is incredibly annoying. There's no point in using it except to kick down doors. It's harder to hit an enemy when he's on the floor or getting up, especially considering that the kick also adds a stun. The cutscenes are stable. Crap. Inappropriate pop-up text that starts to irritate you over time, and fortunately, they pile on more. It has an old-movie feel, which I find completely out of place. Besides that, the cutscenes themselves are laggy, and the graphics seem worse than the game itself. Sometimes, due to the NPCs' stupidity, you can't complete a mission right away (the homeless attack on the police station, the prison escape, the slave escort from the building).
Bottom line: The game isn't great, but it's not bad either. I recommend picking it up on sale (I bought it for 70 rubles) if you're interested in playing, despite the dubious reviews."

Este juego fue ser un desastre en su creación, un desastre en su interfaz, el hecho de que la voz del postal dude no es la misma, prácticamente el gameplay entero, etc... Pero, personalmente como un fan enorme de los Postals digo yo que el juego realmente NO ES TAN MALO (Intenta digerir esas palabras). Me lo he pasado y hecho prácticamente todo y las pocas veces que me han salido bugs no me han molestado ya que el juego apenas tiene. La historia sigue siendo igual de tonta y con humor negro que los anteriores Postal y hasta me a hecho reír.

La mecánica de la buena o mala reputación no es tan mala si te lo pones a pensar, es algo muy interesante donde te ofrecen dos historias completamente distintas si prefieres ser sádico y matar o prefieres ser bueno y noquear. ""Pero, es que Postal es un juego sádico"" Dejadme recordaros de que en Postal 2 recalcó que el que hace las acciones malas eres tú y que se puede pasar el Postal entero sin matar a nadie o no hacer cosas malas.

Aparte, que el juego sea de tipo lineal no es tan malo debido a la cantidad grande de misiones que tiene aunque este podría ser un punto malo del juego dependiendo de a quién se lo preguntes. Aunque, un punto del que quiero hablar en serio es su sonido, está MUY elevado y debéis bajarlo si no queréis una contaminación acústica gratuita.

En definitiva, no es ni será el mejor Postal de la serie (Posiblemente el peor) pero SIGUE siendo un Postal en mi opinión. Te acostumbrarás a la interfaz, a la voz del postal dude y a todo lo demás con el tiempo en el que juegas. Dale una oportunidad, no es tan malo como dicen.","Is Postal 3 really a bad game? It's a somewhat controversial topic, but I'm going to give my opinion.

This game was a disaster in its creation, a disaster in its interface, the fact that the postal worker's voice isn't the same, practically the entire gameplay, etc. But, personally, as a huge Postal fan, I say that the game really ISN'T THAT BAD (Try to digest those words). I've beaten it and done practically everything, and the few times I've encountered bugs, they haven't bothered me since the game barely has any. The story is still just as silly and darkly humorous as the previous Postal games, and it even made me laugh.

The good or bad reputation mechanic isn't that bad if you think about it; it's a very interesting thing where you're offered two completely different stories if you prefer to be sadistic and kill or you prefer to be good and knock people out. ""But, Postal is a sadistic game."" Let me remind you that in Postal 2, I emphasized that you're the one who does the bad things and that you can play through the entire Postal game without killing anyone or doing bad things.

Aside from that, the linear nature of the game isn't that bad due to the large number of missions, although this could be a downside to the game depending on who you ask. However, one point I want to talk about seriously is its sound; it's VERY loud, and you should turn it down if you don't want unnecessary noise pollution.

Ultimately, it's not and won't be the best Postal game in the series (possibly the worst), but it's STILL a Postal game in my opinion. You'll get used to the interface, the Postal Dude's voice, and everything else over time. Give it a chance; it's not as bad as they say."

Постал 3 принято тут кошмарить и утопать в негативных отзывах, но на самом деле это простой проходняк, который заберёт у вас 3 часа жизни, а если ещё захотите пройти по разным путям (добра или зла), то просто умножьте эту цифру на 2.

В целом да, можно выделить баги, когда что-то по скрипту не отрабатывает или вылеты, но в целом, если часто сохраняться, то в целом игра спокойно проходится от А до Я.

По сюжету многого не скажешь: Чувак ищет работу.

Собственно тут не добавить и не убавить, это треш игра с разными заданиями, пойди туда, поделай что-то, реши проблему или оружием, или шокером, хочешь быть добряком? - ок. Резко захотел стать злюкой? - да, пожалуйста. Финал по сути один.

Некоторые моменты глуповаты, что немного смешно в катсценах, матюки тоже в тему, я зашёл в игру, отдохнул без вникания и уже её удаляю.

Чаще всего будет бесить одни и те же комментарии при стрельбе или задержании нпс, Чувак проговаривает 6 фраз по кругу каждый раз, что уши вяжет.

Немного грустно становится, что некоторые ачивки тоже забагованные и не даются к получению, но в целом на один раз действительно стоит игру пройти и забыть.","[h1] Looking for a Job [/h1]

Postal 3 is a common tactic here, often mired in negative reviews, but in reality, it's a simple slog that will take up three hours of your life. And if you want to explore different paths (good or evil), just double that.

Overall, yes, there are some bugs where the script doesn't work or crashes, but overall, if you save often, the game is easy to play from A to Z.

There's not much to say about the plot: A guy is looking for a job.

There's really nothing to add or subtract here; it's a trash game with different tasks: go there, do something, solve a problem with a weapon or a stun gun. Want to be a good guy? - OK. Suddenly want to be an evil guy? - Yes, please. The ending is essentially the same.

Some moments are a bit silly, which is a bit funny in the cutscenes. The swearing is also appropriate. I logged into the game, relaxed without delving into it, and am already deleting it.

Most often, the same comments when shooting or arresting NPCs will irritate me. Dude repeats six phrases over and over again, which is annoying.

It's a bit sad that some achievements are also bugged and impossible to obtain, but overall, it's really worth playing through the game once and forgetting about it."

[b]Данная игра кривущий кусок кала, который ни один фикс не исправит, ибо играть просто невозможно внятно из-за таких вещей как:
- Кривого ИИ,
- Вечного налета орд противников палящих в тебя за километры,
- Кривого освещения, тени которых может наглухо скрыть врага и ты только обнаруживаешь их по трейсу пуль, 
- Ужаснейшие задания с напарниками, которых тебе без конца пропихивают, где подохнуть от пули своих чуть ли не сто процентные шансы имеет, 
- Тупейшие недошутки с сатирой и отсылками на тренды , которые даже в нулевых уже считались каким-то старьем запылившимся ,типо Мавродия с МмМ или порно актеря из 80х , 
- Тупые боты гражданские, которые бегают под пули с союзниками, от чего ты даже желая сохранить карму, сто процентов ее профукаешь, 
- Топорное управление персонажем, где контроль во всех аспектах отвратителен,
- Озвучка от Куража, тут крайне всрато интегрировано. Как-бы не ценил в свое время данную озвучку, за тот же сериал ""Теория большого взрыва"" , но тут это больше раздражает, чем какойто стиль дает,
- Отсутствие чекпоинтов где они нужны, от чего приходится с этим кривущим управлением вручную делать сейв, за что думаю можно быть благодарным, но не Трешмастерам, а Valve за их сурс движок с системой сейвов,
- И много мелких недоработок, которые убивают желание играть, как баги со звуком, возможности вылетов не пойми откуда и т д, что встретить можно крайне редко, но ой как метко для взрыва пуканов. 
[hr][/hr] 
В игре имеются и интересные моменты, такие как:
- Система кармы, зависимая от стиля игры,
- Стильное меню с чуваком смотрящим телик, 
- Сам сюжетный концепт с психологом и нуждой надыбать денег на бензин,
- И может быть чтото еще? Можете дополнить. Не лезет в голову в момент написания. 	[/b]

	[b]В качестве завершения хочу дополнить, что данный отзыв, это итог двух попыток пройти игру. Сначала в варианте из коробки, после с кучей фиксов и патчей из руководств и с ними игра действительно стала приятней для игры, как добавление управления их гта, возможность прыжка и т д, но приятное чувство от возможности в целом играть, а не комфорта игры, ибо даже со всеми фиксами, игра отвратительна в отклике и удобстве , особенно в шутерном сегменте, что является критически важным, ибо тебя пичкают ордами противников и когда тебе еще ко всему прочему нужно не дать умереть союзникам , ты по итогу испытываешь страдания, от кривой стрельбы, возможности подохнуть от пули союзника , неадекватного поведения напарников, которые могут просто под пулю прыгнуть или убежать от тебя фиг знает куда и орд противников, видящих тебя за километры порой. Как я ее прошел в 10х годах ума не приложу, а может и не прошел , ибо ничерта не помню из нее, кроме вылетов и багов. Мб игра и вовсе сломалась , а я и дропнул тогда, как сделал сейчас.	[/b]","[h3]So, after seeing this fake on Steam, I decided to reminisce about the past, because I played this in the early 2010s and it was my mistake.[/h3]
[hr][/hr] 
[b]This game is a broken piece of crap that no fix will fix, because it's simply impossible to play coherently due to things like:
- Bad AI,
- The constant onslaught of hordes of enemies firing at you from kilometers away,
- Bad lighting, the shadows of which can completely obscure an enemy and you only detect them by their bullet traces,
- Horrible missions with partners that are constantly being pushed onto you, where you have an almost 100% chance of dying from your own bullet,
- Stupid half-jokes with satire and references to trends that even in the 2000s were already considered dusty old crap, like Mavrodi and Mmm or An 80s porn actor,
- Stupid civilian bots that run under fire from their allies, so even if you want to save karma, you'll definitely lose it,
- Clumsy character controls, where control is atrocious in every aspect,
- Voice acting by Courage, which is extremely poorly integrated here. As much as I appreciated this voice acting back in the day, like in ""The Big Bang Theory,"" here it's more annoying than it adds any style,
- Lack of checkpoints where they're needed, forcing you to manually save with these clunky controls, for which I think we can be grateful, not to Trashmasters, but to Valve for their source engine with the save system,
- And many minor flaws that kill the desire to play, like sound bugs, the possibility of crashing out of nowhere, etc., which are extremely rare, but oh so accurate for exploding asses.
[hr][/hr] 
The game has some interesting aspects, such as:
- A karma system that depends on your playstyle,
- A stylish menu with a guy watching TV,
- The story concept itself, with a psychologist and the need to find money for gas,
- And maybe something else? Feel free to add. It's just not coming to mind at the moment I'm writing. [/b]
[hr][/hr] 
[b]In conclusion, I'd like to add that this review is the result of two attempts to complete the game. Initially, out of the box, then with a bunch of fixes and patches from the manuals, the game really became more enjoyable to play, like the addition of GTA controls, the ability to jump, etc. But the pleasure comes from the overall experience, not the comfort of the game. Even with all the fixes, the game is terrible in terms of responsiveness and usability, especially in the shooter segment, which is critically important because you're bombarded with hordes of enemies, and when you also have to keep your allies alive, you end up suffering from poor shooting, the possibility of dying from an ally's bullet, the inappropriate behavior of teammates who might simply jump in front of a bullet or run away from you who knows where, and hordes of enemies who can sometimes see you from kilometers away. How I beat it in the 2010s, I have no idea, and maybe I didn't, because I don't remember a thing about it except for crashes and bugs. Maybe the game broke completely, and I dropped it then, just like I did now.[/b]"

МИНУСЫ: Несмешной юмор, непонятно зачем сменённый голос локализации с Postal 2 (который был действительно легендарным) на бездарный закадровый голос MTV, что убивает какую-либо харизму ГГ. ИИ максимально тупое, миссии можно пробежать или буквально вооружиться m4 и стрелять по головам, словно открывая пивные банки, боссы также проходятся с первой попытки. Ну и от такой серии не ждёшь какого-то сюжета, но здесь он невероятно скомкан, глуп и сделан ради галочки, а не чтобы посмеяться от трэшового и карикатурного повествования. Про идиотизм некоторых заданий и абсолютное отсутствие что конкретно искать и делать в некоторых местах молчу.

Можно пройти если вы фан серии, т.к. 3-4 часа не так уж и много для линейного шутана, но ничего интересного вы здесь не найдёте","Let's start with the pros: technically, it's currently quite good; it didn't crash once in 3.5 hours, it's fairly optimized, and its graphics require 10 times less PC resources than Postal 4. The soundtrack and character models are also excellent.
CONS: The humor is unfunny, and the localization voice was inexplicably replaced from Postal 2 (which was truly legendary) with the inept MTV voiceover, which kills any charisma the protagonist might have had. The AI ​​is incredibly dumb; you can run through missions or literally arm yourself with an M4 and shoot people in the head like you're opening beer cans. Bosses are also easily beaten on the first try. You wouldn't expect a plot from a series like this, but here it's incredibly rushed, stupid, and done for show, not to get a laugh from the trashy and cartoonish narrative. I won't even mention the idiocy of some missions and the complete lack of direction in some places.

It's worth a try if you're a fan of the series, as 3-4 hours isn't that long for a linear shooter, but you won't find anything interesting here."

Вылеты на новых и сильных машинах скорее из за не поддержки игры ваших видюх и процов. Вот у меня древнейший селерон, на средне высоких играю в 40-50 фпс. Вылета только два, но оно лечится сейвами вовремя.
Пока не прошел, но надо будет допройти. Игра неплохая, юмор тупой, но для меня моментами забавный.","I don't know why people hate Post 3.
Some of the jokes are dumb, but mostly it's good.
The optimization is utterly terrible.
Crashes on newer, more powerful machines are most likely due to the game not supporting your graphics cards and processors. I have an ancient Celeron, and I play at 40-50 fps on medium-high settings. I've only had two crashes, but they're fixed with timely saves.
I haven't finished it yet, but I'll have to finish it. The game is decent; the humor is dumb, but I find it funny at times."

Released in 2011, it attempts to build on the franchise’s reputation for outrageous, over-the-top violence and dark humor, but unfortunately, it’s marred by numerous technical problems, awkward controls, and a lack of polish that severely undermines the experience. While the game tries to maintain the anarchic spirit and irreverent tone fans expect, the final product feels like a half-finished project that struggles to capture the chaotic fun of its predecessors.

The narrative centers around the series’ iconic anti-hero, known simply as the Postal Dude, who returns to his hometown of Catharsis to find things have changed in unsettling ways. The game’s story is a satirical take on American culture, politics, and social issues, filled with crude jokes, offensive stereotypes, and intentionally provocative scenarios. However, the humor often misses the mark, coming across as more crass than clever. The writing and voice acting are uneven, with many lines feeling forced or recycled, lacking the sharp wit and satirical edge that made earlier Postal games memorable.

Gameplay in Postal 3 diverges from the isometric view of the first two games, shifting to a third-person perspective with open-world elements. This change had the potential to modernize the series and offer players more freedom, but the execution leaves much to be desired. The controls are clunky and unresponsive, making simple actions like aiming, shooting, and navigating the world frustrating. Combat is a mix of ranged and melee weapons, but the combat mechanics feel shallow and unsatisfying, lacking the visceral punch that fans might expect from a game centered around violent chaos.

The open-world design attempts to provide players with multiple mission options and side activities, but the environments themselves are bland and poorly detailed. Catharsis feels lifeless, with repetitive NPC behaviors and minimal interaction. Missions are often monotonous and rely heavily on fetch quests or straightforward “go here, kill that” objectives that don’t add much variety or depth. Additionally, technical issues such as frequent bugs, crashes, and long loading times plague the experience, disrupting immersion and leading to player frustration.

Graphically, Postal 3 is outdated even for its release period. The character models and textures lack detail, animations are stiff and unnatural, and the overall visual design feels uninspired. Sound design fares little better: ambient sounds are sparse, weapon effects are underwhelming, and the soundtrack is forgettable. While the voice work attempts to inject some personality, it often falls flat due to poor direction and mediocre performances.

Multiplayer modes were included but failed to generate a significant player base, largely because of the game’s many flaws and the niche appeal of the series. Consequently, the multiplayer experience is almost irrelevant today, with servers either empty or non-existent.

Despite its many shortcomings, Postal 3 is not without some redeeming qualities. For fans who appreciate the series’ controversial humor and are willing to look past the technical and design flaws, the game still offers moments of dark comedy and bizarre scenarios that align with the franchise’s legacy. The variety of weapons and the ability to approach missions in different ways—whether with stealth, brute force, or chaos—can provide brief bursts of enjoyment. There’s also a cult charm to its raw, unpolished nature, which some players find oddly endearing.

Ultimately, Postal 3 is a flawed and frustrating game that fails to live up to the standard set by its predecessors. It struggles with poor controls, repetitive gameplay, uninspired world-building, and technical issues that often derail the experience. While it tries to maintain the irreverent spirit of the Postal series, it does so with less wit and much less finesse. For newcomers or those unfamiliar with the franchise, it’s not a recommended entry. But for die-hard fans willing to endure its many problems, it might offer a gritty, if infuriating, continuation of the saga.

Итак, купил и установил эту самую третью часть. Думал, ну а что могло пойти не так? Следующая часть культовой серии, да ещё и на движке Source, да ещё и от русских разработчиков — сейчас будет дикий угар, шутки про водку, маты и тот самый POSTAL-дух, только в три раза больше и детальнее. Первые 20 минут даже радовался: заветный русский мат, знакомый Постал, вроде бы всё как мы любим.

А потом началось...

И знаете, я даже вылетов не нашёл! Зато я нашёл всё остальное. Это не игра, это ходячий кошмар тестера на кривом движке. Веду я этого убогого шлемососа в подвал, а дверь закрыта намертво. Говоришь ему «ступай за мной», а он упирается в стену и сходит с ума. Начинается перестрелка двух потеряшек, а они оба с меткостью пьяного шерифа — стоят и палят в небо, и пока ты не придешь и не убьешь одного.  тебе на следующую локацию не пройти. Это не баги, это уже системная особенность, такой перформанс «сломай себе психику».

Но самое главное преступление — у игры отобрали ДУШУ. Ту самую свободу действий, ради которой мы все и любили POSTAL 2. Хотел просто побаловаться, пострелять в голубей, поджечь прохожих? А хрен тебе! Игра тебя буквально за шкирку тащит по сюжету и орёт: «Вали зарабатывай бабки, бомж!». И вот ты уже не Повелитель Хаоса, а послушный курьер, который бегает по унылым линейным локациям и выполняет тупейшие задания: «отвези эту бандуру вон туда». КУДА ОТВЕЗТИ? КАК ОТВЕЗТИ? Карта — бесполезная картинка, подсказок — ноль. Ты носишься по всему району, пытаясь угадать, в какой же из одинаковых проходов нужно тыкаться. И всё это вперемешку с адскими миссиями сопровождения идиотов, которые упорно бегут под пули.

Итог: Это не POSTAL. Это какая-то грустная пародия, сделанная людьми, которые слышали об оригинале только в пересказе. Похоже, разработчики потратили все силы на запись русской озвучки, а на геймплей и тест у них уже не осталось ни денег, ни желания.

В текущем состоянии — это памятник тому, как можно убить великую франшизу одной неверной игрой. Не стоит ни копейки, ни секунды вашего времени. Рекомендовать можно только археологам игровой индустрии, изучающим самые громкие провалы.

ценный урок: даже самая любимая серия может скатиться в такое дно, что потом десять лет отгребают последствия. И да, игру я всё ещё не прошёл но отзыв писать уже могу. 

P.S. Шлемосос, я тебя прощаю. Ты не виноват, что тебя создали такими кривыми руками.

Акела говна поела) 
И кстати, это только небольшая часть от всего ада который там происходит!
Надеюсь.. когда я куплю Постал 4 я увижу хорошую, интересную и качественную игру.","Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, or How to Ruin a Legend.

So, I bought and installed this third installment. I thought, what could possibly go wrong? The next installment in this cult series, powered by the Source engine, and developed by Russian developers—it's about to be a wild ride, with jokes about vodka, swearing, and that same POSTAL spirit, only three times bigger and more detailed. For the first 20 minutes, I even enjoyed it: the cherished Russian swearing, the familiar Postal, everything seemed just as we love it.

And then it started...

And you know, I didn't even find any crashes! But I found everything else. This isn't a game, it's a tester's nightmare on a broken engine. I'm leading this pathetic helmet-sucker into the basement, and the door is locked tight. You tell him, ""Follow me,"" and he runs into the wall and goes crazy. A shootout between two lost characters begins, and they both stand there, shooting into the sky, with the accuracy of a drunken sheriff. Until you go and kill one, you won't be able to progress to the next location. These aren't bugs; they're a systemic feature, a kind of ""break your psyche"" performance.

But the biggest crime is that they've robbed the game of its SOUL. That very freedom of action that made us all love POSTAL 2. You just wanted to have fun, shoot pigeons, set people on fire? No way! The game literally drags you by the scruff of the neck through the story, yelling, ""Go earn some dough, bum!"" And suddenly you're no longer the Lord of Chaos, but an obedient courier, running through dreary, linear locations and completing the most stupid tasks: ""take that thing over there."" WHERE DO I TAKE IT? HOW DO I TAKE IT? The map is a useless picture, with zero clues. You're running around the entire neighborhood, trying to guess which of the identical passages you should poke your head into. And all this is interspersed with hellish missions escorting idiots who stubbornly run into bullets.

Bottom line: This isn't POSTAL. It's some kind of sad parody, made by people who've only heard about the original in retellings. It seems the developers spent all their efforts recording Russian voiceovers, but they had neither the money nor the will to spend on gameplay and testing.

In its current state, it's a monument to how a great franchise can be ruined by one bad game. Not worth a penny, not a second of your time. Recommended only to game industry archaeologists studying the most notorious failures.

A valuable lesson: even the most beloved series can sink so low that it takes ten years to deal with the consequences. And yes, I still haven't finished the game, but I can already write a review.

P.S. Helmetsucker, I forgive you. It's not your fault you were created with such clumsy hands.

Akela ate shit)

And by the way, this is just a small part of all the hell that's going on there!
I hope... when I buy Postal 4, I'll see a good, interesting, and high-quality game."
203463665,russian,2025.08.04 00:05,✅,✅,0.5637899041,4,"Боже, поиграв в POSTAL 2, учитывая сколько негативных отсылок было на POSTAL 3, я действительно подумал что игра получилась очень ужасной и провальной.. НО ЭТО АБСОЛЮТНО НЕ ТАК, в основном эту игру гнобят люди, которые просто банально попали под пропаганду RWS.

Лично я, который действительно прочувствовал эту игру, могу сказать, что это игра просто шикарна. без багов конечно не обходится, с этим я соглашусь, но по большей части скорее всего это из-за того, что на игру просто забили и не фиксят ничего, ведь посчитали ее ""провальной"". 

Могу сказать что багов там особо и нет, но в основном имеются краши игры и багается сюжет. так же, лично у меня была такая проблема, в полицейском участке, миссию с электрошокером добром пройти не получалось, приходилось просто расстреливать там всех, ибо игра при выстреле электрошокером крашилась, и причем работает это в рандом момент, может и не крашнуться, но если такое произошло, придется проходить с последнего сохранения.

В целом, еще раз повторюсь, игра шикарна, её не полюбили в основном только по причинам: ""плохое и неудобное управление"" (лично как по мне оно играбельно и даже удобно), ""плохая оптимизация"" (честно я был в шоке насколько оптимизация там хороша) и т.к. эту игру делала русская студия, наверное, американцы просто не поняли русских шуток.

По моему мнению, POSTAL 3 - самая недооцененная игра, все же я советую вам ее к прохождению, в игре присутствует отличная графика и все выглядит красиво, ну и конечно же шутки, я думаю, вы не пожалеете))","God, after playing POSTAL 2, considering all the negative references to POSTAL 3, I genuinely thought it was a terrible game and a failure. BUT THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE. The people who are mostly criticizing this game are people who simply fell for RWS propaganda.

Personally, having truly experienced this game, I can say it's simply amazing. Of course, it's not without bugs, I agree, but that's mostly because they simply gave up on the game and haven't fixed anything, considering it a ""failure.""

I can say there aren't really any bugs, but there are mostly crashes and a bit of a glitchy plot. I personally had the same problem: I couldn't get through the stun gun mission at the police station without a hitch. I had to just shoot everyone there, because the game crashed when I fired the stun gun. It works at random times, and it might not crash, but if that happens, you have to restart from your last save.

Overall, I'll say it again: the game is fantastic. The main reasons I didn't like it were because of ""poor and awkward controls"" (I personally think they're playable and even convenient), ""poor optimization"" (I was honestly shocked at how good the optimization was), and because this game was made by a Russian studio, maybe the Americans just didn't get the Russian jokes.

In my opinion, POSTAL 3 is the most underrated game out there, but I still recommend it. The game has excellent graphics and everything looks beautiful, and of course, the jokes. I think you won't regret it."

Postal став шутером від третьої особи (У 2011 році) завдяки студіям ""Running With Scissors"" та ""Акелла"" (руснявий видавець, який все похєPив). Після відомої ""Postal 2"", геймери чекали ще більшого безумства, чорного гумору, відсилок і повної свободи, а отримали х*й e сраку + технічно слабку й криву хрінотінь🤡

Події розгортаються після фіналу ""Postal 2"": Гг Dude переїжджає до міста Кеттервілль. Ідея була дати вибір між ""гарним"" і ""поганим"" шляхом, але реалізація вийшла як душний жарт, який писали у ""Аншлазі"" зі своєю лінійною сюжеткою, примітивними місіями і без сенсованими виборами, які взагалі ні на що не впливають у цій залупHі🙃

Главная проблема — попытка перейти на движок Source, который так и не раскрыл потенциал игры. Глюки, убогая физика, примитивный ИИ и неудобное управление превращают прохождение в мучение. Даже фирменный почтальоновский юмор здесь кажется вымученным, а сюжет — бессвязным набором стереотипов.

201314653,italian,2025.07.03 01:16,❌,❌,0.5,0,"Ho giocato Postal III su PC, acquistando una chiave su AllKeyShop per 1 euro. Ero curioso di vedere con i miei occhi cosa fosse andato storto in questo capitolo tanto criticato. Dopo averlo finito, posso dire che sì, le critiche erano fondate, e in certi momenti forse persino generose.

La prima cosa che salta all’occhio fin dall’inizio è la quantità impressionante di bug. Già nel prologo, sul ponte, quando bisogna dare fuoco agli zombie usando la benzina, ho avuto problemi: non c’era verso di versarla nella buca. È stato il primo segnale che qualcosa non funzionava come doveva. In generale il gioco è pieno di problemi tecnici. Mi è capitato più volte che i comandi di movimento si bloccassero da soli, le porte non si aprissero, i personaggi da scortare si piantassero e l’intelligenza artificiale sembrava spesso completamente assente. In più di un’occasione il gioco si è bloccato improvvisamente, soprattutto in prossimità delle cut-scene.

Un altro aspetto che mi ha colpito è stato il comportamento del protagonista. Le sue scelte e i suoi commenti sembrano talmente assurdi da farmi chiedere continuamente “perché?”. Nei capitoli precedenti l’umorismo grottesco era parte dell’identità della saga, ma qui si ha la sensazione di impersonare un tizio semplicemente stupido, senza alcun carisma. Anche la scelta di rendere il gioco in terza persona, rispetto alla prima dei precedenti titoli, non mi ha dato particolari emozioni. Non l’ho trovata né una miglioria né un difetto, semplicemente un cambiamento che non aggiunge né toglie molto.

Dal punto di vista grafico, l’uso del Source Engine mi è piaciuto. Sul mio PC il gioco è girato senza problemi, anche se ho letto che al lancio l’ottimizzazione era disastrosa. Alcune animazioni sembrano effettivamente mal rifinite, e in generale c’è quella sensazione costante di un gioco lasciato a metà, come se fosse stato completato di fretta o senza una vera supervisione.

Quello che più mi ha deluso, però, è la componente satirica. Postal è sempre stato un gioco politicamente scorretto, irriverente, sopra le righe, ma con un minimo di coerenza e una sua logica interna. Qui invece la volgarità sembra fine a se stessa. Le battute, i dialoghi e le situazioni “sconvolgenti” non fanno ridere, non colpiscono, non disturbano: semplicemente, non funzionano. Manca completamente la vena di assurdità coinvolgente che aveva caratterizzato il secondo capitolo.

Anche la struttura del gioco contribuisce al senso generale di delusione. La libertà dell’open world di Postal 2 è stata sostituita da una progressione lineare e noiosa. Le missioni sono poco ispirate e l’arsenale, per quanto vario, presenta armi che risultano quasi del tutto inutili. Personalmente, ho trovato deludenti strumenti come le granate, lo “spara-sperma” (la prima arma che si trova), o i gatti-assassini, che sembrano inseriti solo per ricordare che siamo in un gioco “fuori di testa”, ma senza alcun vero effetto comico o ludico.

Dopo aver completato il gioco, la sensazione è quella di aver assistito a un’occasione completamente sprecata. Affidare lo sviluppo a uno studio esterno, Akella, si è rivelato un errore clamoroso. Il risultato è un prodotto mal progettato, tecnicamente instabile e narrativamente inconsistente. Postal III non è semplicemente un brutto gioco: è un titolo che sembra non sapere cosa vuole essere. Spero sinceramente che Postal 4 riesca a riportare la serie su binari migliori, più vicini allo spirito originale.

In definitiva, non mi pento di averlo giocato, ma solo perché adesso posso parlarne con cognizione di causa. Però lo ammetto: anche a un euro, forse ho speso troppo.","I played Postal III on PC, purchasing a key from AllKeyShop for €1. I was curious to see for myself what had gone wrong with this much-criticized installment. After finishing it, I can say that yes, the criticism was well-founded, and at times, perhaps even generous. 

The first thing that stands out from the start is the impressive number of bugs. Already in the prologue, on the bridge, when you have to set zombies on fire using gasoline, I ran into trouble: there was no way to pour it into the hole. It was the first sign that something wasn't working as it should. Overall, the game is riddled with technical issues. I've had several instances where movement controls would freeze on their own, doors wouldn't open, characters I was escorting would get stuck, and the AI ​​often seemed completely absent. On more than one occasion, the game suddenly froze, especially near cut-scenes. 

Another aspect that struck me was the protagonist's behavior. His choices and comments seem so absurd that they make me constantly ask, ""Why?"" In previous installments, grotesque humor was part of the franchise's identity, but here you feel like you're playing someone who's simply stupid, devoid of any charisma. Even the decision to make the game third-person, compared to the first-person perspective of previous titles, didn't particularly resonate with me. I didn't find it an improvement or a flaw, simply a change that didn't add or take away much.

Graphically, I liked the use of the Source Engine. The game ran flawlessly on my PC, though I've read that the optimization at launch was disastrous. Some animations do indeed seem poorly polished, and overall, there's that constant feeling of a game left unfinished, as if it were rushed through or unsupervised. 

What disappointed me most, however, was the satirical element. Postal has always been a politically incorrect, irreverent, and over-the-top game, but with a modicum of coherence and internal logic. Here, however, the vulgarity seems an end in itself. The jokes, dialogue, and ""shocking"" situations aren't funny, they don't resonate, they don't disturb: they simply don't work. The vein of engaging absurdity that characterized the second installment is completely missing.

The game's structure also contributes to the overall sense of disappointment. The freedom of Postal 2's open world has been replaced by a linear and boring progression. The missions are uninspired, and the arsenal, while varied, features weapons that feel almost entirely useless. Personally, I found tools like the grenades, the ""sperm shooter"" (the first weapon you find), and the killer cats disappointing, as they seem to be inserted merely to remind you that this is a ""crazy"" game, but without any real comic or playful effect.

After completing the game, I feel like I've witnessed a completely wasted opportunity. Outsourcing development to an external studio, Akella, proved to be a resounding mistake. The result is a poorly designed, technically unstable, and narratively inconsistent product. Postal III isn't simply a bad game: it's a title that doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. I sincerely hope that Postal 4 manages to bring the series back on track, closer to the original spirit.

Ultimately, I don't regret playing it, but only because I can now speak with full knowledge of the facts. But I admit: even at one euro, I probably spent too much."

A legbotrányosabb bug akkor jön elő, mikor meghalsz, visszatöltöd, és megkavarodik az irányítás - ilyenkor teljesen ki kell lépni és újra indítani a játékot, mert a játékon belüli újraindítás nem ér semmit se.

Csak azért vettem elő, mert hát része a Postal szériának, illetve nekem is át kell és kellett élnem azt, amiről néztem videót, de teljesen más úgy elhordani minden szarnak, hogy ha játszottál ezzel, akkor tudod miért szar.
És hogy ennek fényében azt mondjam: mentsd a lelket és az idegeidet és NE JÁTSSZ EZZEL A SZUTYOKKAL!!!",

ข้อดีของภาคนี้✅
มีมุมมองบุคคลที่3:ทำให้เห็นโดยไม่ต้องโดนยิง
ระบบกำบัง:ที่หลบกระสุนได้
การaimอาวุธ
ระบบรีเจนเลือดเอง:เพิ่มความactionให้กับตัวละครได้
ระบบความดีความเลวที่สามารถเลือกเองได้จากการกระทำ
ชุดpostal dude เเละ ภาพสวยขึ้น
ข้อเสีย❌
fpsที่dropเป็นจังหวะทำให้เสียจังหวะในการเล่นมาก
เกมที่เหมือนกับยังทำไม่เสร็จเเล้วเหมือนรีบเอามาขาย
บัคกระจายที่ไม่คิดว่ามันจะได้เจอถ้าเป็นบัคที่ฮาๆจะไม่ค่อยด่าเลยเเต่มันส่งผลต่อการเล่นด้วย
ผมมองว่าการให้เกมเป็นopen worldเเละดำเนินเป็นวันยังดูดีกว่าเดินด้วยมิชชั่นเเบบนี้อาจจะมีบ้างเเต่มันก็ยังไม่เติมพอ
เสียงที่บางทีก็หายก็มาขาดๆเกินๆ
AIที่เดินมั่วเหมือนงงอะไรกับชีวิตไม่ว่าจะเราหรือศัตวู์ก็มั่วพอๆกันบางที่มันจะชอบมาเดินเข้าหาลูกปืนเราบ้างทำให้เราเผลอยิงตายเเละเสียค่าความดีไปโดยไม่จำเป็นเเละเวลายืนกำบังอยู่มันจะชอบยืนอยู่หลังเราไม่ใช่หลังกำบังข้างๆเราเเต่มันคือหลังเราเลยเเล้วมันจะเดินชนเราทำให้เราบัคเเละยิงปืนก็ไม่ได้เดินออกก็ไม่ได้ต้องโหลดเซฟใหม่อย่างเดียว
❗❗โดยรวมทั้งหมด❗❗
ผมไม่ค่อยเเนะนำภาคนี้ครับถึงเเม้มันจะมีข้อดีอย่างที่บอกเเต่ถ้าพูดตามตรงคือเทียบกับภาคก่อนไม่ได้เลยทั้งความสนุกความอิสระหรือต่างๆยกเว้นงานภาพเล่นไปเเล้วก็น่าลำคาญกับการที่FPS DROPเป็นช่วงๆเเละข้อเสียอื่นๆที่ได้กล่าวไว้","Among all the postal games, I think this is the worst.
Pros✅
Third-person perspective: allows you to see without getting shot
Cover system: allows you to dodge bullets
Weapon aiming
Self-regeneration system: adds action to your character
Good and evil system: allows you to choose your own actions
Postal Dude outfit and better graphics
Cons❌
The intermittent fps drops really disrupt the gameplay
The game feels unfinished and rushed to sell
The plethora of bugs I never thought I'd encounter. If they were funny bugs, I wouldn't complain much, but they impact gameplay.
I think it's better to have an open-world game that spans days than to have a mission like this. There might be some, but it's not enough.
The audio is sometimes missing and sometimes lacks some of the original content. The AI ​​walks around like it's confused about everything, whether it's us or the enemy. Sometimes it'll walk towards our bullets, causing us to accidentally shoot and waste merit unnecessarily. Also, when we're taking cover, it tends to stand behind us, not behind us, but directly behind us. It'll then collide with us, causing us to glitches and unable to shoot, unable to exit, and have to reload the save.
❗❗Overall❗❗
I don't really recommend this installment, even though it has the advantages I mentioned. Honestly, it can't compare to the previous installments in terms of fun, freedom, or anything else. Except for the visuals, it's annoying with the occasional FPS drop and the other shortcomings I mentioned."

1. Если ты злыдень,то вертайся на плохую концовку
2.Если ты был менее жестоким,но был не злыднем,то ты получаешь хорошую концовку 
3.Если ты паинька,тобишь никого не убивал(сюжетные боссы в конце не считаеются)то ты получаешь счастливую концовку где показывают лицо интервьюера,а не как в прошлых концовках

в общем игра разочаровала,но и немного порадовала,были спорные моменты с настройкой управления и с корявым мачете,но это лишь мелкие недочеты и баги

в общем 6 обоссаных углов из 10","Can I say the game is good? - No, can I say the game is bad? - No, it's average, with a plot that continues the Dude's story. Yes, there's some unfunny humor, but there are some funny moments too. I like Post-3 and am glad that you have a choice of paths:

1. If you're evil, then go back to the bad ending.
2. If you were less cruel, but weren't evil, then you get the good ending.
3. If you're good, meaning you didn't kill anyone (story bosses at the end don't count), then you get the happy ending where you see the interviewer's face, not like in previous endings.

Overall, the game was disappointing, but also a little enjoyable. There were some questionable moments with the control settings and the awkward machete, but these are just minor flaws and bugs.

Overall, 6 piss-stained corners out of 10."

ХОРОШЕМ говне. Нет я серьезно, это говорю я вам, ладно, по минусам: 1. Игра забагованна, ВЕЗДЕ (У меня такое ощущение что я почти везде обнаружил баги с озвучкой и многим чем ещё, но спешу вас обрадовать! Игру капельку пофиксили, ну как минимум два апдейта на неё вышло) 2 Шутки.. Иногда плоские, иногда вообще ни к месту (Короче это типо не минус и не плюс, но мне много не зашло) 3 Тупящий ИИ, вот с вот этой штуки у меня так горело когда я проходил сюжет.. (Представим ситуацию на примере из игры - ваша миссия  дойти с вашим компаньоном до финальной двери или что-то типо того, допустим вы вычистили всех врагов на уровне подходите к финальной двери и.. ничего не происходит. Ничего! И ты приходишь к этому говножую который стоит и втупляет в стену! Ну или просто врезался в хитбоксы какого-то предмета и тоже стоит и тупит) Плюсы: 1. Действительно неплохая русская озвучка и.. Эм.. А это всё. Я действительно не советую играть тем людям кто прошел Постал 2 только что (Потому что я и сам таким был, пока не поиграл в этот ШЕДЕВР, кстати был очень что игра по сути сделана нашими, за это конечно лайк, но плюса от этого игре никакого нет) короче, это не то что бы хотели увидеть фанаты прошлой части (И да, пометка кто это читает: я советую лучше поиграть в дополнение к второму Посталу, оно правда лучше и проверено на собственном опыте) Я считаю что из этого проекта могла вырасти и правда хорошая игра но.. Получилось что получилось! Я ставлю оценку - 4/10 (PS: Спасибо за прочтение!)","Look, if I approach writing a review objectively (using all my eloquence), Postal 3 plays like you're digging through crap, but (important note!) GOOD crap. No, I'm serious, I'm telling you this, okay, about the cons: 1. The game is buggy, EVERYWHERE (I have a feeling that I found bugs with the voice acting and many other things almost everywhere, but I hasten to please you! The game has been fixed a little, well, at least two updates have been released for it) 2. Jokes.. Sometimes flat, sometimes completely out of place (In short, this is not a minus and not a plus, but I didn’t like much) 3. Stupid AI, this is the thing that really burned me when I was going through the story.. (Let's imagine a situation using an example from the game - your mission is to get with your companion to the final door or something like that, let's say you cleared out all the enemies on the level, approach the final door and.. nothing happens. Nothing! And you come to this shit-eater who is standing and running into the wall! Well, or just crashed into the hitboxes of some object and is also standing and running) Pros: 1. Really good Russian voice acting and... Um... That's all. I really don't recommend it to people who just finished Postal 2 (Because I was the same way until I played this MASTERPIECE. By the way, I really thought the game was essentially made by our people, so of course I like it, but it doesn't add any positives to the game). In short, this isn't what fans of the previous part would want to see. (And yes, a note for anyone reading this: I recommend playing the expansion to Postal 2, it's truly better and I've tested it myself.) I think this project could have turned into a really good game, but... It turned out that way! I give it a 4/10 (PS: Thanks for reading!)"

But then came Postal III… and it’s like they FLUSHED everything good straight down the toilet. Russian devs took over (big mistake), engine change (Source???

They took a Beautiful Sandbox of freedom and turned it into a corridor shooter with AI dumber than the people running California.

Also, the game sucks at counting achievements. I just shot a corpse in the hand and the game crashed.

In short, the game is super over-the-top imbalance for fans. The only downside is that all the characters are voiced by one person, and the NPCs speak English. Also, killing people isn't fun. CONCLUSION: I regret everything."

196426584,brazilian,2025.05.05 06:25,✅,✅,0.6649873853,14,"POSTAL 3 foi um dos únicos jogos da série que não foi desenvolvido pela RUNNING WITH SCISSORS e sim pela AKELLA games que já tinha uma boa experiência com a franquia, já que eles desenvolveram o CORKSCREW RULES que é a expansão russa do POSTAL 2 que foi lançado apenas na Rússia, apesar desse jogo ter sido desenvolvido pela a AKELLA games a RUNNING WITH SCISSORS teve total supervisão do projeto.
Grande parte das pessoas que falam mal do POSTAL 3 é gente que nem se quer parece fã de verdade da franquia como também não entende oque é POSTAL e esse pessoal dessa sociedade gamer atual nutella que tem prencoceito pelo fato do POSTAL ser um jogo de baixa orçamento, prioriza um monte de babaquice que pouco importa como que para o jogo ser bom ele tem que ter gráficos ultra realistas e mapa aberto sem se quer experimentar porque esse pessoal que fala mal do POSTAL 3 é gente que nem sequer jogou o jogo assim como essas pessoas adaptadas a sociedade atual que se encomodam com as sátiras que o jogo envolve que remetem a realidade do mundo que elas não querem encarar usando os seus pontos de jogo de baixo orçamento para falar mal sem nem se quer ter experimentado.
Oque a maioria das pessoas não entende é que o POSTAL é um compilado de sátiras a realidade do mundo de merda em que vivemos que a maioria das pessoas não quer encarar porque se encomoda e o POSTAL 3 permanece como um POSTAL do jeito que nós gostamos como ele mantém os principais pontos que polemizaram a franquia como as sátiras que aumentaram ainda mais, o conteúdo politicamente incorreto, a sacanagem e a violência gráfica. As figuras da vida real que servem para representar as sátiras da série POSTAL aumentaram ainda mais com participações do Ron Jeremy que o famoso PORN KING ou rei do pôrno que é um ator pôrno muito famoso lá das antigas que já fez uma cacetada de participações especiais em filmes famoso que no jogo ele funda o PORNWORLD como também se torna candidato a prefeito de CATHARSIS, a Jennifer Walcott que é uma modelo da playboy da playmate de 2001 que aqui no POSTAL é a nova POSTAL BABE da RUNNING WITH SCISSORS, o Randy Jones que é o cowboy gay do VILLAGE PEOPLE que lidera uma gangue de gay bikers em CATHARSIS onde ele tem um rancho apenas para cowboys gays, Sergey Mavrodi que foi responsável pela maior fraude da historia da Russia onde ele cometeu mais de 10 mil contra os seus investidores do MMM que acabou que no POSTAL 3 ele é um exilado da Rússia que veio pra CATHARSIS onde ele comprou a sala de caça-níqueis do Jack Thompson que ele transformou em um centro de computadores que processam matrizes de dados para que ele desse continuidade a tentativa de fraude contra os seus investidores tentado até subornar o próprio POSTAL DUDE a investir no banco dele, o UWE BOLL que é o conhecido como o pior diretor que dirige adaptações de jogos de qualidade bem duvidosa já que ele não dá a mínima pro projeto pra no final o filme ser um fiasco e para ele não ser prejudicado pelo fracasso do filme ele vai para o governo do país dele que no caso é a alemanha pra resolver a treta do fracasso do filme para ele não ser prejudicado sendo bem pago no final saindo ileso que é uma estratégia que ele praticava em todos projetos como ele também já desafiou os críticos dele para uma luta de boxe onde eles apanharam feio do BOLL sendo convidado para fazer uma participação especial no POSTAL 3 como ele dirigiu o maravilhoso filme do POSTAL que é bem POSTAL, aqui temos o retorno do tio DAVI que é o tio do POSTAL DUDE que no POSTAL era lider de um complexo de hippies maconheiros em Paradise que aqui em CATHARSIS ele passa a trabalhar com o Ron Jeremy no tráfico de slave boys como também com a AL-QAEDA com a aparição do próprio OSAMA BIN LADEN em pessoa que está realizando os seus ataques terroristas em CATHARSIS para impor a ideologia dos TALIBÃS como também trabalha junto com o tio DAVI numa negocição com o KROTCHY em que a AL-QAEDA vai trazer um carregamento de bonecos KROTCHY que são compostos de plutônio para o KROTCHY que no final vai fornecer metade do carregamento para a AL-QAEDA, o AL Gore que é o ex-vice-presidente do USA como também um ambientalista que aqui no POSTAL 3 lidera uma facção de ecologistas da natureza que usam texugos no lugar de motoserra, a Sarah Palin que é uma política feminista dos Estados Unidos que no POSTAL é a lider das Hockey Moms que são as feministas de CATHARSIS e o ditador da Venezuela Hugo Chávez que no final do jogo decide botar o seu projeto deu um bloco socialista junto com o Brasil e Cuba em ação para impor o socialismo no Estados Unidos já que esse é o sonho desses vermelhinhos nojentos que investiram tanto nesse bloco que acabou que a Venezuela quebrou economicamente como também o país tá na merda, no caso de Cuba depois da morte do Fidel Castro o irmão dele nem se quer vai conseguir investir nesse bloco como Cuba sempre foi um país pobre e no Brasil com o retorno do Lula na política que está piorando os preços dos produtos que consumimos só falta o Brasil quebrar de vez assim como a Venezuela.
O POSTAL 3 permanece assim como o POSTAL 2 já que você é livre pra fazer oque quiser sem ninguém mandar em você onde novamente acompanhamos a conturbada vida do POSTAL DUDE que agora está com 43 anos de idade tentado ser uma pessoa agir como uma pessoa passiva como também oque ele está fazendo em CARTHARSIS para ganhar a vida, apesar que ele não consegue ser uma pessoa passiva em questão das tretas que ele acaba se metendo no meio do seu caminho o forçando a virar novamente uma pessoa insana como ele foi em PARADISE como também no POSTAL 3 assim como no POSTAL 2 você tomar escolhas que vão influenciar no seu caminho como também no final caso você querer atuar como um cidadão de bem, uma pessoa completamente insana ou um pacifista. O POSTAL 3 ele foi desenvolvido na SOURCE engine a engine da VALVE, eu não um desse viadinhos que prioriza gráficos no entanto um ponto que eu tenho que ressaltar do POSTAL 3 é que para um jogo de baixo orçamento ele tem gráficos impressionantes mesmo para um jogo de baixo orçamento como o visual do POSTAL DUDE que é muito foda, o visual do tio DAVE é foda, o próprio Ron Jeremy lembra ele próprio na vida real como também a Jennifer Walcott, o Randy Jones, o Uwe Boll e o Bin laden por conta do nível de detalhes absurdos que eles capricham como a física do jogo.
Um ponto que eu gosto de destacar do POSTAL 3 é que diferente dos jogos anteriores ele adotou uma estética setentista muito inspirada nos filmes do GRINDHOUSE do Quentin Tarantino e do Robert Rodrigues que eram uma homenagem as produções polêmicas e politicamente incorreta que estreavam no GRINDHOUSE durante as décadas de 60 até 70, essa estética é refletida muito na moda do POSTAL DUDE que deixou de ser a moda gótica anos 2000 dele no POSTAL 2 para uma moda mais inspirada na estética setentista como também a trilha sonora que pra mi tem a melhor seleção de músicas da série já que eles licenciaram o instrumental das músicas da banda russa PETER PAN THE BAND que encaixam perfeitamente com a estética do jogo como são músicas de metal misturado com hard rock dos anos 70 a direito a toca de gaita criando umas músicas muito emocionantes para os momento que você vai detonar com a porra toda.
Uma coisa que me deixa feliz é que ainda existe uma comunidade de fãs da série POSTAL que defendem o POSTAL 3 como também reconhecem que ele foi um jogo muito injustiçado por conta dessa sociedade em que vivemos que quer nos esconder da realidade como também eu senti prazer de ter a total liberdade de estripar do socialistas nojentos do POSTAL 3 que estão imundando o meu país como também destruir o tanque do Hugo Chávez com o meu AT-4 para no final eu mijar em cima dele e me sentir como o salvador da América do Norte e salvador da Pátria que livrou os ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMÉRICA dos socialistas nojentos ou como eu diria´´I REGRET NOTHING´´
GABRIEL ONURIS TEM QUE VER A MINHA ANÁLISE, PORQUE EU SOU MUITO FÃ DELE.","POSTAL 3 was one of the only games in the series that was not developed by RUNNING WITH SCISSORS but by AKELLA games, which already had good experience with the franchise, as they developed CORKSCREW RULES, the Russian expansion of POSTAL 2, which was only released in Russia. Although this game was developed by AKELLA games, RUNNING WITH SCISSORS had full supervision of the project. Most of the people who speak badly of POSTAL 3 are people who don't even seem like true fans of the franchise, nor do they understand what POSTAL is, and these people from this current Nutella gamer society who are prejudiced against the fact that POSTAL is a low-budget game, prioritize a bunch of nonsense that doesn't matter much, like for the game to be good it has to have ultra-realistic graphics and an open map without even trying it. Because these people who speak badly of POSTAL 3 are people who haven't even played the game, as well as those people adapted to today's society who are bothered by the satires that the game involves, which refer to the reality of the world that they don't want to face, using their low-budget game points to speak badly without even having tried it. What most people don't understand is that POSTAL is a compilation of satires on the reality of the shitty world we live in that most people don't want to face because it bothers them and POSTAL 3 remains a POSTAL the way we like it as it maintains the main points that made the franchise controversial such as the satires that increased even more, the politically incorrect content, the naughtiness and the graphic violence. The real-life figures that serve to represent the satires of the POSTAL series increased even more with appearances by Ron Jeremy, the famous PORN KING or king of porn, who is a very famous porn actor from the past who has made a ton of special appearances in famous films, who in the game he founds PORNWORLD and also becomes a candidate for mayor of CATHARSIS, Jennifer Walcott, who is a Playboy model from the 2001 Playmate who here in POSTAL is the new POSTAL BABE from RUNNING WITH SCISSORS, Randy Jones, who is the gay cowboy from VILLAGE PEOPLE who leads a gang of gay bikers in CATHARSIS where he has a ranch only for gay cowboys, Sergey Mavrodi who was responsible for the biggest fraud in the history of Russia where he committed more than 10 thousand against his MMM investors who ended up that in POSTAL 3 he is an exile from Russia who came to CATHARSIS where he bought the slot machine room from Jack Thompson, who he turned into a computer center that processes data matrices so that he could continue the attempted fraud against his investors, even trying to bribe the POSTAL DUDE himself to invest in his bank, UWE BOLL, who is known as the worst director who directs adaptations of games of very dubious quality since he doesn't give a damn about the project so that in the end the film is a flop and so he isn't harmed by the failure of the film, he goes to the government of his country, which in this case is Germany, to resolve the mess of the film's failure so he isn't harmed and is well paid in the end, coming out unscathed, which is a strategy he practiced in all projects. He also challenged his critics to a boxing match where they got beaten up badly by BOLL, being invited to make a special appearance in POSTAL 3 as he directed the wonderful POSTAL film, which is very POSTAL. Here we have the return of uncle DAVI, who is the uncle of POSTAL DUDE, who in POSTAL was the leader of a complex of stoner hippies in Paradise. Here in CATHARSIS, he starts working with Ron Jeremy in the slave boy trafficking as well as with AL-QAEDA with the appearance of OSAMA BIN LADEN himself who is carrying out his terrorist attacks in CATHARSIS to impose the ideology of the TALIBAN as well as working together with uncle DAVI in a negotiation with KROTCHY in which AL-QAEDA will bring a shipment of KROTCHY dolls that are composed of plutonium to KROTCHY who in the end will provide half of the shipment to AL-QAEDA, AL Gore who is the former vice president of the USA as well as an environmentalist who here in POSTAL 3 leads a faction of nature ecologists who use badgers instead of chainsaws, Sarah Palin who is a feminist politician from the United States who in POSTAL is the leader of the Hockey Moms who are the feminists of CATHARSIS and the dictator of Venezuela Hugo Chávez who at the end of the game decides to put his project in a block socialist together with Brazil and Cuba in action to impose socialism in the United States since this is the dream of these disgusting little reds who invested so much in this bloc that Venezuela ended up economically bankrupt and the country is also in the shit, in the case of Cuba after the death of Fidel Castro his brother will not even be able to invest in this bloc as Cuba has always been a poor country and in Brazil with the return of Lula in politics that is worsening the prices of the products we consume all that is missing is for Brazil to go bankrupt once and for all like Venezuela. POSTAL 3 remains the same as POSTAL 2 since you are free to do whatever you want without anyone ordering you around where we again follow the troubled life of POSTAL DUDE who is now 43 years old trying to be a person and act like a passive person as well as what he is doing in CARTHARSIS to earn a living, although he cannot be a passive person in terms of the messes he ends up getting into in his path forcing him to become an insane person again as he was in PARADISE as well as in POSTAL 3 as in POSTAL 2 you make choices that will influence your path as well as in the end if you want to act as a good citizen, a completely insane person or a pacifist. POSTAL 3 was developed using the SOURCE engine, a VALVE engine. I'm not one of those faggots who prioritizes graphics, but one thing I have to highlight about POSTAL 3 is that for a low-budget game, it has impressive graphics, even for a low-budget game, like the look of POSTAL DUDE, which is really cool, Uncle DAVE's look is awesome, Ron Jeremy himself resembles himself in real life, as well as Jennifer Walcott, Randy Jones, Uwe Boll and Bin Laden because of the absurd level of detail they put into the game's physics. One point I like to highlight about POSTAL 3 is that, unlike previous games, it adopted a seventies aesthetic heavily inspired by the GRINDHOUSE films by Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodrigues, which were a tribute to the controversial and politically incorrect productions that premiered on GRINDHOUSE during the 60s and 70s. This aesthetic is greatly reflected in POSTAL DUDE's fashion, which went from his 2000s gothic fashion in POSTAL 2 to a fashion more inspired by the seventies aesthetic, as well as the soundtrack, which for me has the best selection of songs in the series, as they licensed the instrumentals of the songs by the Russian band PETER PAN THE BAND, which fit perfectly with the game's aesthetic, as they are metal songs mixed with 70s hard rock, right down to the harmonica, creating some very exciting songs for those moments when you're going to rock the hell out. One thing that makes me happy is that there is still a community of fans of the POSTAL series who defend POSTAL 3 and also recognize that it was a game that was very unfairly treated because of this society we live in that wants to hide us from reality. I also felt pleasure in having the total freedom to gut the disgusting socialists from POSTAL 3 who are flooding my country, as well as destroy Hugo Chávez's tank with my AT-4, so that in the end I could piss on it and feel like the savior of North America and the savior of the Fatherland who freed the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA from the disgusting socialists, or as I would say, ""I REGRET NOTHING.""

195461465,russian,2025.04.23 12:54,✅,✅,0.5238095522,1,"Postal III — игра, которую трудно оценить однозначно. С точки зрения геймплея и общей реализации — это проект, балансирующий на грани: в нём есть как удачные находки, так и очевидные промахи. Главный герой, знакомый всем нам как просто Чувак, на протяжении всей игры безуспешно пытается устроиться в жизни, перебирая самые разные профессии — от уборщика в стриптиз-клубе и угонщика сегвеев до телохранителя и, в буквальном смысле, мишени. Но ирония судьбы оставляет старика с дырой в кармане. 
Сюжет уже привычно развивается по дням, и каждый день преподносит игроку фирменную смесь абсурда, чёрного юмора и злой социальной сатиры, сопровождённой жестокостью и насилием — именно ту атмосферу, за которую полюбили франшизу Postal. Особенно порадовала озвучка Дениса Колесникова: его голос и перевод добавляют проекту особого шарма и ностальгической теплоты...
Вдаваться в детали сюжета не стану — пусть это останется на долю игрока. Однако одно можно сказать точно: если вы поклонник серии, то, несмотря на все огрехи, этот «забытый» и во многом спорный выпуск всё же стоит подметить. Отдельное спасибо Акелле.","Postal III is a game that's difficult to evaluate. In terms of gameplay and overall execution, it's a project that teeters on the edge: it has both successful achievements and glaring missteps. The main character, known to us all as the Dude, spends the entire game trying unsuccessfully to find his way in life, trying a variety of jobs—from a janitor at a strip club and a Segway thief to a bodyguard and, quite literally, a target. But a twist of fate leaves the old man with a hole in his pocket.

The plot, as usual, unfolds day by day, and each day presents the player with the signature blend of absurdity, dark humor, and wicked social satire, accompanied by cruelty and violence—precisely the atmosphere that made the Postal franchise so beloved. I was especially delighted by Denis Kolesnikov's voice acting: his voice and translation add a special charm and nostalgic warmth to the project...
I won't go into plot details—that's up to the player to decide. However, one thing is certain: if you're a fan of the series, then despite all its flaws, this ""forgotten"" and largely controversial installment is still worth checking out. Special thanks to Akella."

Wow. Just… wow.

Postal III is a masterpiece of modern game design. Who needs functional controls or coherent storylines when you can crash to desktop because you sneezed near an NPC? Genius. The devs clearly asked, ""What if we made a sequel that no one asked for, took everything people liked about Postal 2, and just... didn’t do any of it?""

The AI? Revolutionary. I’ve never seen cops run face-first into walls for five minutes straight. Truly ahead of its time.

Voice acting? Oscar-worthy. Everyone sounds like they recorded their lines at gunpoint through a potato.

Gameplay? Oh, the gameplay! Nothing beats the thrill of trying to walk in a straight line while the camera does its best impression of a drunk uncle at a wedding. Also, the moral choice system? Beautiful. Be good or evil? Joke’s on you, both paths suck equally. Equality at last.

In conclusion: Postal III cured my insomnia, ended my relationships, and made me reflect deeply on every life choice that led me here.

11/10. Play it if you hate yourself.

Рекомендую к прохождению для фанатов Посрала, обычным людям тоже — чисто поугарать на вечерок-другой.

- В открытом мире особо делать нечего — тот же Посрал 2 играется в опенворлде получше и насыщеннее.
- Стрелять из огнестрела приятно, а вот ближний бой (кроме барсука) — неудобный и бесполезный.
- Уровни, на которых сделан основной упор, выполнены нормально. Иногда бывают вылеты или застревания персонажей, но благо в игре есть быстрые сохранения.
- HUD, как и начальное и пауза-меню, выглядят приятно.
- Шутки и рофлы в стиле Постала 2 — найс, некоторые даже выписал себе.

Скидок на эту игру не ждите — их просто нет. Берите, если не жалко или если вы фанат.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3479802648","POSRAL III

I recommend it to fans of Posral, and to regular people as well—just for a fun evening or two.

- There's not much to do in the open world—Posral 2 plays better and more intensely in the open world.
- Firing guns is enjoyable, but close combat (except for the badger) is awkward and useless.
- The levels, which are the main focus, are well-executed. Occasionally, there are crashes or characters getting stuck, but thankfully, the game has quick saves.
- The HUD, as well as the start and pause menus, are nice.
- The jokes and jokes in the style of Postal 2 are nice; I even wrote some down for myself.

Don't expect any discounts on this game—they simply don't exist. Get it if you don't mind, or if you're a fan.

Озвучка Кураж-Бамбея +- неплохая. За время выбивания ачивок были некоторые трудности, с поломанными элементами, но как итог, все получилось выбить. Юмор на любителя. Если чуть привыкнуть к управлению, то можно и на 3/5 оценить. (P.S. Не помню точно по поводу данной версии, но как-то наткнулся на заметки разраба в самом коде, где хотелось ему посочувствовать в плане работы).","I'll try to summarize: the game isn't fully polished (if you study its history, this isn't surprising), but at the same time, it has a storyline of sorts, even technically local to the CIS. Kurazh-Bambey's voice acting is pretty good. While earning achievements, there were some difficulties with broken elements, but in the end, everything worked out. The humor is an acquired taste. If you get a little used to the controls, you might even rate it a 3/5. (P.S. I don't remember exactly about this version, but I once came across some developer notes in the code itself, where I wanted to commiserate with him about his work.)"

Quizá te de por probarlo, a día de hoy le metieron algunos parches, eliminaron 3 logros que estaban rotos, no había manera de sacarlos. Arreglaron también unos bugs referente a otros logros que era super complicado y tedioso hacerlos, si por algún motivo tienes problemas hay guías referentes a optimización que pueden arreglar tu problema y por ultimo y no menos importante tiene traducción al español por parte de la comunidad :)

Me dio como 4 crasheos en total, no me afecto en partidas guardadas ni nada por el estilo, ya se le pueden sacar sus logritos sin problema por si quieres completarlo jsjs

And I'm not going to lie, I really liked it hahaha. It has a good and bad ending depending on your decisions, crazy weapons as usual and good variety, third-person gameplay that was also interesting. It made me laugh a lot with the random things and what you can do, despite its reputation in the series (it was banned).

Maybe you'll give it a try. Today they put in some patches, removed 3 achievements that were broken, there was no way to get them. They also fixed some bugs related to other achievements that were super complicated and tedious to complete. If for some reason you have problems, there are optimization guides that can fix your problem. And last but not least, it has been translated into Spanish by the community :)

I had about 4 crashes in total. It didn't affect my saved games or anything like that. You can now easily get the achievements if you want to complete them, lol.

Além do jogo de fato ser bem meia boca os problemas técnicos pioram a situação. A IA é patética, a movimentação do Dude é toda travada, a trilha sonora além de fraca possui um bug de tocar na cutscene, as conquistas inicialmente não desbloqueiam o que te força a ir na pasta do jogo e editar um arquivo de configuração para funcionar (WTF?), bug que afeta a progressão da fase (tipo o jogo te dar objetivo de derrotar um numero x de inimigos mas alguns não aparecem) o que me fez desistir de jogar. 

Mesmo sendo a ovelha negra da franquia eu tentei jogá-lo para ver se de fato é tão ruim quanto dizem e... posso dizer que em apenas uma hora de jogo você já vê o quão fraco é, porém eu não esperava que tivesse bug que afetasse a conclusão da fase, se não tivesse isso eu teria insistido em jogar... que paia.





3 reais foi muito caro.","This thing is complicated; playing for an hour was complete torture.

Besides the game actually being pretty mediocre, the technical issues make matters worse. The AI ​​is pathetic, the Dude's movement is completely clunky, the soundtrack, besides being weak, has a bug that plays during the cutscene, the achievements don't unlock initially, forcing you to go into the game folder and edit a configuration file to make them work (WTF?), and a bug that affects level progression (like the game gives you the objective of defeating a certain number of enemies, but some don't appear), which made me give up playing.

Even though it's the black sheep of the franchise, I tried to play it to see if it's really as bad as they say, and... I can say that after just an hour of play, you already see how weak it is. However, I didn't expect there to be a bug that affected level completion. If it hadn't, I would have insisted on playing... what a drag.

Игра и вправду очень кривая, вечно дергающиеся камера из-за третьего вида, неудобное переключение оружия, Нпс которые ведут себя хуже чем во втором Postal, кривое зачитывание ачивок и т.д. и т.д. А также, это игра стала могилой для такой компании как Akella, которая подарила мне в детстве легендарных Корсаров. Спи спокойно, волк на оранжевом квадрате. Но в этой игре есть и свои плюсы, это все тот же анти-социальный проект где абсурд идет рядом с кучей мата, треша и использованных салфеток. Это улыбнуло.","Until the very end, I hoped that all the ""bad"" reviews were just exaggerated fanboyism from the second game. But unfortunately, that's not the case. The game is truly flawed: the camera is constantly twitching due to the third view, weapon switching is awkward, NPCs behave worse than in the second Postal, achievements are poorly announced, and so on and so forth. This game also became the graveyard of a company like Akella, the one that gave me the legendary Corsairs as a child. Sleep well, wolf on the orange square. But this game has its upsides, too; it's still the same anti-social project where absurdity goes hand in hand with a ton of swearing, trash, and used napkins. That made me smile."

En cuanto a crasheos sólo me crasheó una vez... y el Postal 2 es más propenso a que le pase eso, y no veo a gente por internet llorando como perras como lo hacen con Postal 3.

La gente yo creo que exagera mucho por internet, me da igual que sea lineal o si es en 3ra persona, como si es de mundo abierto. Yo me lo pasé bien jugandolo. No te dejes engañar por lo que dicen por ahí. Yo me arriesgué comprandolo y tampoco es como dicen.

Última cosa, si no hubiera ocurrido la crisis mundial de 2008/2009 Akella pudo haber hecho un mejor trabajo y no teniendo que despedir a mitad de la plantilla dejando a gente con menos experiencia. Dicho esto acabo.","Let's see... the game itself isn't bad, but some missions are bugged. Like the mission with the dog with the laser pointer (it works terribly), plus there's a high chance the dog will get stuck, or the mission with that degenerate [i]sadomasochist[/i] who gets stuck in doors and you have to kick him to make him walk, lol.

As for crashes, it only crashed once... and Postal 2 is more prone to that, and I don't see people online crying like bitches like they do with Postal 3.

I think people exaggerate a lot online. I don't care if it's linear or in third-person, as much as it is open world. I had a good time playing it. Don't be fooled by what people say out there. I took a risk buying it, and it's not what they say.

Last thing, if the global crisis of 2008/2009 hadn't happened, Akella could have done a better job and wouldn't have had to lay off half the staff, leaving less experienced people in the fold. With that, I'll conclude."

Игра раздражает своими неработающими механиками (привет кошачья мята), кривизной в каждом аспекте игрового геймплея, вылетами, унылым однотипным сюжетом с коридорными локациями (каждую миссию мы пытаемся заработать дненег, ноу  Чувака не получается), не срабатывающими скриптами (например, нпс, которого нужно обязательно убить, пропадает или вообще не респавнится; скрипт на определенной точке по сюжету не работает по какой-то причине), юмора/сатиры в игре нет, хоть и пытались, ну и кураж бомбей как испорченная вишенка на невкусном торте. Чтобы получить достижения нужно хорошенько изъебнуться, даже с сюжетными. Порой приходилось перепроходить миссии по 5 раз, танцуя с бубном. 
Короче говоря, кривой кусок кода, а не игра. Ну хоть короткая, и на том спасибо. 

Хотелось бы все-таки отметить и плюсы, которые тут имеются. Во-первых, это музыка, которая оставляет приятное впечатление, музыку в главном меню хочется слушать и в отрыве от игры. Во-вторых, дух второго постала действительно можно ощутить в первых миссиях игры, но и тот очень быстро улетучивается под всеми минусами этой игры. 
Покупать и играть в это можно исключительно ради эксперимента.","[h1] I don't regret anything [/h1]

The game could have been quite acceptable, but we have what we have.
I launched the game with great optimism, thinking that all the hate, while deserved, was likely exaggerated, and that the game itself could at least offer an interesting experience. Unfortunately, my expectations were completely disappointed, and I can't recommend this game, even for a beer in the evening.
The game is frustrating with its broken mechanics (hello, catnip), flaws in every aspect of gameplay, crashes, a dull, repetitive storyline with corridor-like locations (we try to earn money in every mission, but the Dude can't), scripts that don't work (for example, an NPC you absolutely must kill disappears or doesn't respawn at all; a script at a certain point in the story doesn't work for some reason). There's no humor or satire in the game, even though they tried. And the bombay swagger is like a bad cherry on a bad cake. Getting achievements requires a fair amount of tinkering, even with the story ones. Sometimes I had to replay missions five times, dancing with a tambourine.
In short, it's a broken piece of code, not a game. At least it's short, so thankfully.

I'd still like to point out the positives that it does have. Firstly, the music leaves a pleasant impression; the main menu music makes you want to listen to it even when you're not playing the game. Secondly, the spirit of the second post-apocalypse can truly be felt in the game's first missions, but even that quickly evaporates under all the game's flaws.
Buying and playing this is purely for the experience."

良かった点
メインメニュー画面とゲーム内BGMが最高にイカしてる

悪かった点
おそらくシリーズ通して一番知名度の高い作品は前作2で異論は無いと思う。

・代金を払わず退店しようとしたら突然シャッターがしまり店主がライフルを構え追いかけ回してくる
・地域密着型の店のバックヤードがテロ組織のアジト
・レジの列に割り込めば後ろから罵倒される
・〇を蹴っ飛ばせば犬がウキウキで咥えて持ってきてくれる
・ドーナツに「イタズラ」して警察に食べさせれば…
・何の意味もなさない「自〇」という選択肢

などと遊び心に溢れていた。古いゲームシステムでチープなグラフィックでもカルト的人気を博していたのはこういった「ポスタルらしさ」が唯一無二だったからである。

では本作はどうであろうか。FPSからTPSに変化。これは制作チームの判断でありこちらが口を出すことではない。だが上記のようなポスタルらしさを破壊した見返りにに2→3へと変化した上で何を得られたのだろうか。自由度の無いマップ、サムい内輪ネタ、絶望的なAI、爽快感の欠片もないアクション…あまりに酷すぎる。唯一プレイする価値があるとするならクリア後のお散歩モード（2と同じくマップを自由に行き来して暴れまわれる）だが、こんな爽快感も遊び心もない世界観で暴れまわれと言われても5分とモチベーションが持たない。本作は善人と悪人ルートを選択して進行できることを売りにしているがこれは前作ではデフォルトだし、そもそも前作は開発側が「選択」をプレイヤーに強制せず「すきにしろ」と投げてくれた。我々が求めるポスタルに「選択肢」など不純物に他ならない

私はシリーズファンという事もあり全エンディングを経験し先日のアプデ（バグ修正）後もプレイした。冒頭にも書いたが本レビューはかなり好意的なフィルターを通した上でのものだ。","As a fan of the series, my review will be heavily biased.

Good Points
The main menu screen and in-game music are absolutely awesome.

Bad Points
There's no doubt that the most well-known entry in the series is the previous game, Part 2.

- If you try to leave a store without paying, the shutters suddenly close and the owner chases you with a rifle.
- The backroom of a local store turns out to be a terrorist hideout.
- If you cut in line at the register, you'll be verbally abused from behind.
- If you kick a ball, a dog will happily bring it back to you with its mouth.
- If you ""trick"" a donut and feed it to the police...
- The meaningless option to ""commit suicide"" is also available.

These kinds of playful elements are all part of the game. Despite its old game system and cheap graphics, it gained a cult following because of this unique ""Postal"" feel.

So what about this game? It changed from an FPS to a TPS. This was a decision made by the production team and is not something we should comment on. But what did they gain from the changes from 2 to 3 in exchange for destroying the Postal feel described above? The maps lack flexibility, the boring inside jokes, the hopeless AI, and the action lacking any sense of exhilaration...it's just too awful. The only thing worth playing is the post-game stroll mode (where you can freely roam the map, just like in 2), but being told to rampage in such a world that lacks exhilaration and playability is not enough to motivate me for more than five minutes. This game boasts the ability to choose between a good guy and a bad guy, but this was the default in the previous game, and the developers of the previous game didn't force a ""choice"" on the player, just let them ""do as they please."" In the Postal experience we expect, ""choices"" are nothing but an impurity.

As a fan of the series, I've experienced all the endings and played the game even after the recent update (bug fixes). As I mentioned at the beginning, this review is written with a fairly positive bias."

I got tired when I had already played it and even completed it, well, and decided to replay it, after all, it is better than nothing. I immediately went to buy all the parts on Steam and when I was already ready to pay for the purchase, I noticed the absence of part 3. At first, I thought that I did not notice it, since this often happens to me due to insomnia, but when I went to the RWS page on Steam, I did not find part 3. This was still strange. Maybe they deleted it or it was so violent that it was banned. I decided to search for information on the Internet and lo and behold, it exists. I immediately went to look for it on Steam and found it. But for some reason, the game had mixed reviews and the metacritic rating was generally 24, although according to the trailer, it looks pretty good. Out of curiosity, I decided to start with part 3. After downloading, I went into the game, completed the tutorial, and began to play the main story. I was very amused by the first mission: collecting napkins in sperm and then shooting them at fat fems, but when I almost finished the quest, the game crashed. It was very strange. My computer is quite powerful and it can’t be that it couldn’t handle some stupid game. I went into it again and it crashed again. Bitch, maybe it’s just some kind of buggy mission or I caught a virus while downloading cute porn art with Miku. I went into it again and the game crashed again. I couldn’t stand it and hit the monitor. Luckily, I’m a very weakling, so I didn’t even break it. But my hand began to hurt as if I had hit a brick wall. And while I was moaning pitifully in pain, someone rang the doorbell. It’s strange who needs me, although maybe my wet dreams have come true and cute Neko-chan came to me. I went to the door and looked through the peephole, but there was no one there. Apparently, stupid children can’t be entertained by their parents, and they decided to pester me by standing there. 5 minutes on the stairwell I didn't see anyone and with a calm soul I entered the apartment eh but if it was cute Neko and not stupid children I would now pour her some tea and start telling stories about my worthless life sitting down at the computer I decided to play Postal Redux it seems like a remake of Postal maybe I'll play the original but then I don't want to injure my hand again because of crashes when I almost completed the first level someone rang the bell again I went to the door looked through the peephole and saw that the postman was standing on the other side I was glad because I recently ordered a dakimakura with cute Neko but it's strange that she arrived so quickly but still, in my joy I decided to open the door for him and take my beloved home opened the door this idiot started poking a shotgun at me and threatening but I didn't listen to him my thoughts were occupied with where he put my beloved I hope that everything is okay with her and this scumbag messenger didn't touch her with his greasy hands and somewhere in a minute he apparently He noticed that I wasn't listening to him, he hit me with the butt of his gun to bring me to my senses, I fell to the floor and cried in pain, and then this asshole did something terrible: he pulled a shotgun on me like the cat from Postal 2 and told me to never play Postal 3 or I'd be screwed."

Третий постал мог стать намного лучше, если бы не прекращение надзора RWS над Акеллой и халатное отношение Акеллы к разработчикам. Зачем начальники Акеллы увольняли множество разработчиков из студии Trashmasters и заставляли работать над игрой почти с самого начала, мы наверное узнаем никогда. Однако со стим патчами, Postal 3 стал играбелным и в принципе он стал очень неплохой игрой. Плюсы: cаундтрек, стилистика, не самый плохой сюжет. Минусы: Баги и вылеты. Да, даже со стим патчами происходят вылеты, но их было даже меньше, чем в Postal 2. Также патчи немного испортили получение сюжетных достижений, так, что если хотите получить все достижения, то смотрите руководства стима по этой игре. В общем, ставлю 6.9/10. Приятной игры и подписываем петицию на удаления позорного Postal 4!","Honestly, having completed this game completely and achieved 100% of the achievements, it had potential. The third Postal could have been much better if not for RWS's cessation of control over Akella and Akella's negligent attitude toward the developers. Why Akella's bosses fired so many developers from Trashmasters and forced them to work on the game almost from the very beginning, we'll probably never know. However, with Steam patches, Postal 3 became playable and, overall, a very good game. Pros: the soundtrack, the style, and a decent storyline. Cons: Bugs and crashes. Yes, even with Steam patches, there are still crashes, but they were even fewer than in Postal 2. The patches also slightly disrupted the story achievements, so if you want to get all the achievements, check out the Steam guides for this game. Overall, I give it a 6.9/10. Enjoy the game, and let's sign the petition to remove the disgraceful Postal 4!"

POSTAL 4 ficou durante muito tempo em acesso antecipado, e a empresa teve um orçamento mais sinistro que Postal 3, e até hoje o jogo é mal otimizado e desregulado. Postal 3 roda bem, afinal, tem a engine source (half-life 2, left 4 dead, etc...), e lançou como a porcaria que é sem acesso antecipado. Essa é a obra da empresa trashmasters, ruim pra caramba, mas sincera kkkk.
O jogo tem um gameplay estranho, muitos NPCs repetidos, animações e ragdolls duvidosos, uma trama pífia que diverte pouco e crasha algumas vezes. Os pontos positivos são que a variedade de armas é bem extensa, a voz do Postal Dude apesar de não ser a do Rick Hunter, ainda é bem feita, a aparição do Uwe Boll é engraçada, as artes são boas, a trilha sonora é bacana e tem legendas e interface PT-BR. Não acho que vale o valor cheio, mas numa promoção de 2 ou 3 reais, pode valer a pena pra jogar, dar umas risadas, ou pra galera mais nova que curte caçar as conquistas, miletar.

POSTAL 4 was in early access for a long time, and the company had a more sinister budget than Postal 3, and to this day the game is poorly optimized and unregulated. Postal 3 runs well; after all, it uses the source engine (Half-Life 2, Left 4 Dead, etc.), and it launched like the crap it is without early access. This is the work of Trashmasters, really bad, but honestly, lol.
The game has strange gameplay, many repetitive NPCs, questionable animations and ragdolls, a lousy plot that's not very entertaining and crashes a few times. The positives are that the weapon variety is quite extensive, Postal Dude's voice, while not Rick Hunter's, is still well done, Uwe Boll's appearance is funny, the art is good, the soundtrack is cool and has subtitles and a Brazilian Portuguese interface. I don't think it's worth the full price, but on a 2 or 3 reais promotion, it might be worth it to play, have a few laughs, or for younger people who enjoy chasing achievements and getting involved.

В триквеле который никому почти не нравится, для меня есть вещи которые мне нравятся.

[h3] Главный герой [/h3]
Как минимум сам чувак, мне он больше всего нравится, он крутой, в очках и ни о чем не сожелеет
и ищет подработку чтобы купить бензина, чтобы ехать дальше по своим чуваковским делам с чампом.

[h3] Музыка [/h3]
А как же без нее? Она тут подбадривает, так и охото ходить и гасить всяких плохих парней под этот кайф для ушей, больше всего из треков мне нравится: helen и nothing is scared, так же и парочка других.

[h3] Сюжет [/h3]
Хоть он и простой, но продолжать его можно долго, что мне нравится.

[h3] Озвучка [/h3]
Она тут сделана круто, в стиле старых фильмов как и сами кастцены где слышна русская озвучка и чутка оригинал, что дает немного вайба и атмосферы того старого времени, за что респект разрабам.

[h3] Гемплей [/h3] 
В основном собери что-то, пока не прибыли враги и потом отстреливаться. Ну я люблю простоту.

[h3] Графика [/h3]
что сказать о ней? видал конечно и получше, но простим 11 году и движку source и тем более игру делали наши слоняры.

Это были вещи которые мне нравятся в третьем постале.

[h3] Оценка: [/h3]10/10

[h3] Стоит покупать? [/h3] Я скажу на любителя.

Не стоит слушать общество которое засирает эту часть, сами поиграйте и поймете. Вам она по нраву? Или вы становитесь обычным нормисом постал общества которое засирает триквел и на это есть свои причины.

[h3] Бонус [/h3] 
Вот мой пак стикеров в тг с чуваком из третьего постала:  https://t.me/addstickers/P3Dude_by_fStikBot","[h1] You can call me an outcast from all humanity, but I like this part! [/h1]

In a threequel that almost no one likes, there are things I like.

[h3] Protagonist [/h3]
At least the dude himself, I like him the most. He's cool, has glasses, and doesn't regret anything.
And he's looking for a part-time job to buy gas so he can continue on his champ-fueled errands.

[h3] Music [/h3]
How could it be without it? It's so invigorating, you just want to run around and take down all the bad guys while listening to this ear-pumping music. My favorite tracks are ""Helen"" and ""Nothing Is Scared,"" along with a couple of others.

[h3] Plot [/h3]
Even though it's simple, it could go on and on, which I like.

[h3] Voiceover [/h3]
It's done really well here, in the style of old films, as are the scenes themselves, where you can hear Russian voiceover and a bit of the original, which adds a bit of vibe and atmosphere to the old days, for which I salute the developers.

[h3] Gameplay [/h3]
Basically, you have to collect something before the enemies arrive and then shoot back. Well, I like simplicity.

[h3] Graphics [/h3]
What can I say about it? I've seen better, of course, but let's forgive 2011 and the Source engine, and especially since the game was made by our own people.

These were the things I liked about the third installment.

[h3] Rating: [/h3]10/10

[h3] Is it worth buying? [/h3] I'll say it's an acquired taste.

Don't listen to the public that's trashing this part; play it yourself and you'll understand. Do you like her? Or are you just becoming a typical normie in a post-society that trashes the third installment, and there are reasons for that.

[h3] Bonus [/h3]

Even though the game isn't the best in the Postal series, I at least laughed and enjoyed watching the native black humor, which I missed out on due to the shitty localization of P4. Yeah, it might not be better than P2, but it's definitely not as shitty as I expected reading the comments and reviews.

Во-первых, техническое исполнение игры оставляет желать лучшего. Баги, вылеты и проблемная оптимизация делают игровой процесс крайне неудобным. Многие игроки сталкивались с тормозами и текстурами низкого качества, что существенно портит впечатление и может отвлекать от основного геймплея.

Во-вторых, сюжет и геймплей в Postal III оказались не столь увлекательными, как ожидалось. Игра потеряла ту уникальную концепцию и черный юмор, за которые ее любили. Вместо этого, многие сцены воспринимаются как плоские и неоригинальные, что создаёт ощущение, что разработчики не приложили достаточных усилий.

Кроме того, многие игроки отмечают, что игра по сравнению с предшественницами стала слишком ограниченной в плане свободы действий. Это противоречит духу оригинальных частей, где игроки могли намекать на то, как им хочется справляться с ситуациями.

В целом, Postal III вызывает разочарование у многих фанатов. Игра не оправдала ожиданий и показывается как шаг назад в серии, что, к сожалению, оставляет негативное впечатление у игроков. Если вы ищете качественный экшен с острым юмором, лучше обратить внимание на более ранние игры в серии.","Postal III is a game that unfortunately disappointed many fans of the series. After the success of the previous installments, this release proved to be quite controversial and unsuccessful.

Firstly, the game's technical execution leaves much to be desired. Bugs, crashes, and problematic optimization make gameplay extremely frustrating. Many players encountered lag and low-quality textures, which significantly detracted from the experience and could distract from the main gameplay.

Secondly, the story and gameplay in Postal III were not as engaging as expected. The game lost the unique concept and dark humor for which it was loved. Instead, many scenes feel flat and unoriginal, creating a feeling that the developers didn't put enough effort into the game.

Furthermore, many players note that the game has become too limited in terms of freedom of action compared to its predecessors. This contradicts the spirit of the original games, where players could hint at how they wanted to handle situations.

Overall, Postal III is a disappointment for many fans. It doesn't live up to expectations and feels like a step backwards in the series, which unfortunately leaves a negative impression on players. If you're looking for a high-quality action game with a sharp sense of humor, it's better to consider the earlier games in the series."

Я люблю серию игр Postal и я был наслышан о проблемах связанные с этой игрой. Я прошел сюжету на среднюю концовку и знаете что? Я словил не единого вылета или иных проблем. Некоторые задания конечно были скучными и нудными, но это же база всех игр. В каждой игре есть что-то с грешком. Postal 3 меня затронул озвучкой Чувака. Да, она не та какая во 2 части, но все таки, голос Чувака в 3 части огонь и полностью ему подходит, особенно русская озвучка. Единственное что я могу сказать плохое, то это вид со спины Черт ПОБЕРИ. Это и правда неудобно в некоторых моментах и это единственная часть в серии игр с таким моментом (если не считать первую и редукс части). В итоге что скажу, люди, я понимаю что разработчикам было похуй на игру и даже так, получился годный продукт в который стоит сыграть хоть разок.","Now I'll try to explain why Postal 3 isn't such a bad game. I'll tell you from my own experience.
I love the Postal series, and I've heard plenty of problems with this game. I played through the middle story ending, and you know what? I didn't experience a single crash or other issue. Some missions were boring and tedious, of course, but that's the foundation of all games. Every game has its flaws. Postal 3 really struck me with the Dude's voice acting. Sure, it's not the same as in Postal 2, but still, the Dude's voice in Postal 3 is fantastic and perfectly suits him, especially the Russian voice acting. The only bad thing I can say is the back view. DAMN IT. It's genuinely awkward at times, and this is the only game in the series with that (aside from the first and redux versions). In the end, what I can say, people, is that I understand that the developers didn't give a shit about the game, and even so, it turned out to be a decent product that's worth playing at least once."

Talvez pelo fato de não ser desenvolvido pela Running With Scissors, e sim por uma empresa russa chamada Trashmasters (também conhecida como TM Studios) que é subsidiária da Akella, que, inclusive, distribuiu esse infame jogo. Mas acho que não dá pra julgar por não ser desenvolvido pela RWS, pois o Postal Brain Damaged também não foi desenvolvido pela RWS, e sim apenas distribuído por, e ainda sim, é um jogo muito bom. Mas, enfim, voltando pro Postal 3, podemos começar com o fato de que o jogo é mal otimizado. Tive 3 crashes no mesmo dia.

O jogo também tem uma jogabilidade esquisita, que não lembra Postal, e não só por ser em terceira pessoa. Além de ser difícil controlar o Postal Dude, ele tem uma troca de arma esquisita. Normalmente, em jogos, você troca as armas no scroll do mouse (que não funciona direito pra mim) ou nas teclas 1, 2, 3, 4... Só que aqui, nesse jogo, é também pelos números, mas também por letras. Então é 1, 2, 3, 4, G, N, T, 5... Isso deixa tudo mais confuso. Além disso, tem gráficos meio estranhos. Mesmo os gráficos do Postal 2 sendo ultrapassados, ainda assim são bem mais bem feitos do que esse jogo aqui. Inclusive, esse jogo tem expressões faciais muito estranhas. Acho que até o Garry's Mod tem expressões faciais melhores.

O humor desse jogo é bemmm duvidoso. É meio humor escatalógico, que fala basicamente sobre: peido, bunda, pênis e mijo. Parece que as piadas desse jogo foram feitas por um garoto de 15 anos de idade tentando ser engraçadão.

O jogo tem missões meio bobas. Tipo a segunda missão, em que você tem que limpar um sex shop de toalhas cobertas de ""p0rr4"" de homens que se entretêm com conteúdo adulto, usando um aspirador de pó. E logo após, umas feministas entram na loja e começam a protestar, e você tem que literalmente jogar toalhas cobertas de ""p0rr4"" nelas com o aspirador de pó... Eu ainda tô achando que não só as piadas foram desenvolvidas por um garoto de 15 anos, mas o jogo inteiro.

Enfim, logo após essa missão, você tem outra missão de capturar gatos raivosos com HIV (???) e tem que usar um spray de catnip pra que eles não te mordam. Só que, quando você pega três, uns chineses ficam put0s contigo e querem te matar. Mas você tem que pegar o resto dos gatos com os chineses te atacando, e isso é bastante difícil, pois os inimigos estão com M16, facões, pistolas, e você não tem nada. Só um aspirador de pó e uma arma de peido que dá pra desmaiar as pessoas (???). Isso deixa tudo muito injusto, pois você é só um contra um monte de chineses com armas de verdade, enquanto você tem uma arma de peido...

Mas, com sacrifício, passei dessa fase e fui pra próxima, dada pelo Vince, inclusive, em que nós temos que ajudar uma das Postal Babes no shopping como segurança, já que umas feministas estavam querendo destruir o evento dela. A missão era dar choque com um taser, e foi aí que o jogo crashou. Foi o momento em que desisti de jogar e pedi reembolso. Tava até pensando em manter o jogo pra ter a coleção completa, mas preferi pedir reembolso e comprar cartinhas pra aumentar meu level na Steam ou um jogo melhor.

Acho que a única parte boa desse jogo é um meme que eu não sabia que vinha daqui: aquele meme do ""Here kitty, you can have cheeseburger"". Não sabia que vinha desse jogo, kkkk.

Enfim, minhas considerações finais são: se você quiser jogar esse jogo por curiosidade, pegue o pirata. É bom que você não gasta nada. Ou então compre, teste e depois peça reembolso, assim como eu.","[h1]I played for 100 minutes and I don't even know where to begin...[/h1]
Maybe because it wasn't developed by Running With Scissors, but by a Russian company called Trashmasters (also known as TM Studios), a subsidiary of Akella, which also distributed this infamous game. But I don't think it's fair to judge just because it wasn't developed by RWS, since Postal Brain Damaged wasn't developed by RWS either, but rather distributed by them, and it's still a very good game. Anyway, getting back to Postal 3, we can start with the fact that the game is poorly optimized. I had three crashes in one day.

The game also has weird gameplay, unrelated to Postal, and not just because it's in third-person. Besides being difficult to control, Postal Dude has a weird weapon switch. Normally, in games, you switch weapons using the mouse scroll wheel (which doesn't work well for me) or the 1, 2, 3, 4 keys... But here, in this game, it's also by numbers, but also by letters. So it's 1, 2, 3, 4, G, N, T, 5... This makes everything more confusing. Plus, the graphics are a bit weird. Even though Postal 2's graphics are outdated, they're still much better done than this game. This game even has some really weird facial expressions. I think even Garry's Mod has better facial expressions.

The humor in this game is really questionable. It's kind of scatological, basically about farts, butts, penises, and piss. It feels like the jokes in this game were made by a 15-year-old trying to be funny.

The game has some pretty silly missions. Like the second mission, where you have to vacuum a sex shop of towels covered in ""p0rr4"" from men who are amused by adult content. And right after, some feminists enter the store and start protesting, and you have to literally throw towels covered in ""p0rr4"" at them with the vacuum cleaner... I still think not only the jokes were developed by a 15-year-old boy, but the entire game.

Anyway, right after this mission, you have another mission to capture rabid cats with HIV (???) and you have to use catnip spray to keep them from biting you. But when you catch three, some Chinese guys get pissed off and want to kill you. But you have to catch the rest of the cats while the Chinese attack you, and that's quite difficult, because the enemies have M16s, machetes, pistols, and you have nothing. Just a vacuum cleaner and a fart gun that can knock people out (???). This makes everything very unfair, as it's just one person against a bunch of Chinese guys with real guns, while you have a fart gun...

But, with sacrifice, I got through this level and moved on to the next one, given by Vince, where we have to help one of the Postal Babes at the mall as security, since some feminists were trying to destroy her event. The mission was to shock her with a taser, and that's when the game crashed. That was the moment I gave up playing and asked for a refund. I was even considering keeping the game to have the complete collection, but I preferred to ask for a refund and buy cards to level up on Steam or a better game.

I think the only good part of this game is a meme I didn't know came from here: that ""Here kitty, you can have cheeseburger"" meme. I didn't know it came from this game, lol.

Anyway, my final thoughts are: if you want to play this game out of curiosity, get the pirated version. It's good that it doesn't cost anything. Or buy it, test it and then ask for a refund, just like me."

Игру спасает её короткая продолжительность из-за чего не успевает надоесть. Мне кажется, игру можно было спасти и развить идеи в будущих играх серии.

It's an interesting situation: there are issues with the game design and mechanics, but nevertheless, there are some very good ideas that bring novelty and fun. It felt like some of the game was made by people who simply had no idea what they were doing, what they were doing, or how to do it. As a result, some things turned out well, while others were downright awful. The game's saving grace is its short length, which prevents it from becoming boring. I think the game could have been saved and its ideas developed in future games in the series. Using Courage Bombay's voice acting was a mistake; it's terrible.

The game only has like 2.5-3 hours of gameplay to it, though it's probably only about 2 hours of gameplay because Akilla just decided to give you the bare minimum when it comes to navigating the map. They will RARELY tell you about KEY MECHANICS in the game, they'll just let you figure if out for yourself after countless rounds of trial and error. Enemies also are just ridiculously beefy, and getting ammo for anything that isn't the pistol or assault rifle is almost impossible.  In the final section of the good ending, I literally had to fight through Venezuelan solders with barely any ammo because it's sparse. And I even had to fight a fucking TANK and I BARELY had any rocket ammo because it gave me the launcher at the END OF THE GAME. Speaking of the rocket launcher, I don't know what was wrong with its M1, but it would blow up in my face anytime I'd press or hold M1, but it would heatseek whenever I M2. 

Catnip is the only consumable, and the ""Niptrip""(my shortened term) isn't even worth it. Instead of getting what feels like 30 seconds of slowed time, you get about 10 seconds of slowed time, you move a little slower too, AND the color palette is migraine inducing- NOT TO MENTION the fact that you get STUCK HALF THE TIME you use it.

The AI pathfinding is the most agitating thing to exist, it's like they intentionally made the companions find every way to slow you down so you have to play the game longer. When a character has to live and you have to get to a certain location, the NPC HAS TO GET TO THE LOCATION TOO. You can't just run through and get to the location to start the cutscene, you HAVE to get the NPC to the location too. Sometimes the NPC's will get stuck in place, run directly into hazards, or they'll decide to go on a side-quest to slay a magic dragon until you reset their pathfinding by tasing them or running into them to knock them down. 

The keybinds are stupid and disorienting, you can't jump, you can't crouch, but you can take cover... which is the only semi-redeemable thing about movement. The running is BAD, you have to sling your mouse to the side like it owes you money if you wanna turn, otherwise you run into a wall like my grandma when she gets belligerent. The movement itself is also shit it's not limited to running. You can only crouch if you're next to cover, but enemies can still shoot you if their gun is even a quark above your cover. You can climb over cover if it's short enough, but you have to button mash until Dude invents the ability to use hands and feet at the same time. Moving across cover is slower than a turtle with a deep vein thrombosis, so you're better off getting off of cover and moving to where you want to get. 

Doors are a whole other monster, good fucking luck getting through one when you're close to failing a mission. In the good ending, there's a section where you have to arrest the ecologists leader... In my run, the front door was glitched and would NOT let me walk through it. I almost died to a swarm of bees because there was some dude in a corner throwing beehives, and I couldn't shoot back at him because he was thundercunting hives at the door. So I had to go through the back door, which the game did a great job of telling me about. 

There's 2 paths to the game... the good path... and the insane path. I only did the insane path because it was faster and I had no idea what I was doing, but I'd rather eat glass than play the game again and do the good path. 

Allies will just randomly decide to shoot you when in combat, and you literally have to evade them until they find an enemy to shoot, or lose aggro. Because if you shoot them, then you'll have to deal with fighting both factions involved in the fight- or- they might just all aggro onto you for no reason, but you won't be forced to kill them all until you kill one of them.

The game straight up gives you the least helpful descriptions, so you're just left with a vague idea of where you're meant to go. Which ends up making you spend more time on the game than you should(playing the game alone still takes too much time, it's not worth it, don't buy it.).

There's ""Optional Fun"" objectives that just feel impossible, like... there's literally a mission where you defend playboy bunny Jennifer Walcott from a bunch of angry hockey moms, and you're SUPPOSED to use a taser to taze the 15-20 soccer moms, and wait for Jennifer to oh so SLOWLY kill them with a shovel, all while you have to protect her so she doesn't die. 
The game was VERY motion sickness inducing, though that might just be a neurological and optical skill issue on my part.

There's more I'd like to rant about, but I feel that even hating on the game is giving too much praise.

Edit: I did the good ending because a friend didn't believe me when I told them how bad this game was... jesus fucking christ... I would have had a more enjoyable time eating sandpaper with a side of neutron star. The good ending makes me wish the primordial soup wasn't an option on gods menu, because I refuse to believe that we evolved as a species and made THIS ""game"". This game should be against the Geneva Convention, it is a genuine hazard to the population and was something even Satan would deem ""too harsh"". I wouldn't wish this game upon my worst enemies. I would rather experience EVERY death(possible and not) over and over again for eternity, than play whatever the FUCK this shit is. RWS, we thank you for shitting on this disaster.

The game only has like 2.5-3 hours of gameplay to it, though it's probably only about 2 hours of gameplay because Akilla just decided to give you the bare minimum when it comes to navigating the map. They will RARELY tell you about KEY MECHANICS in the game, they'll just let you figure if out for yourself after countless rounds of trial and error. Enemies also are just ridiculously beefy, and getting ammo for anything that isn't the pistol or assault rifle is almost impossible.  In the final section of the good ending, I literally had to fight through Venezuelan solders with barely any ammo because it's sparse. And I even had to fight a fucking TANK and I BARELY had any rocket ammo because it gave me the launcher at the END OF THE GAME. Speaking of the rocket launcher, I don't know what was wrong with its M1, but it would blow up in my face anytime I'd press or hold M1, but it would heatseek whenever I M2.

Чем же и страдал тот же самый Fallout: New Vegas. Но если Вегас починить смогли, то, судя по всему, до играбельного вида эту игру сумели доделать лишь недавно (полностью сломав получения достижений).

Слышал, что эту игру не стоит покупать даже за те жалкие 40 рублей, за которые ее отдают на скидках. И что даже фильм Уве Болла будет лучше этой игры.
И да, фильм и правда лучше, но я не согласен с первым заявлением.

Игра увлекательная. В ней приятно стрелять, классная музыка и очень крутой визуальный стиль. Что графика, что просто интерфейс. Даже третье лицо, как по мне, выполнено хорошо. 

Сюжет хоть и рваный, недоделанный и разделяется на 3 концовки, 1 из которых кал, а другие получать попросту скучно, но сюжет есть и он.. ну нормальный. Шутки есть и шутки забавные. Да и игра проходится за 3-4 часа,  как и первые две части. Но в отличие от тех, тут есть сомнительные моменты, как, например, обучение скучнейшее.

Багов словил ровно 0. Возможно повезло, но ни единой проблемы не было.

Но все таки игра очень сильно отошла от оригинала. Очевидно, что фильм Постал является гораздо большим идейным вдохновителем, чем первые 2 части. Но разрабы сюжет знают, ибо в начале точно его пересказали.
Не знаю по какой причине было это сделано, ведь и фильм сам по себе хоть и максимально выполнен в духе Постала, но слишком сильно от него ушел. Так и тут такая же история. Но хоть чувак похожий на изначального.

Постал 3 стоит купить за 40 рублей, если вам нравится Постал и уж тем более если вам понравился фильм. На сегодняшний день ее можно пройти от начала и до конца. Можно, но не обязательно нужно.
","A game deservedly drowned in its own crap due to its sheer unplayability at launch.

The same thing that plagued Fallout: New Vegas. But while Vegas was fixed, it seems they only recently managed to polish this game to a playable state (completely breaking the achievement system).

I've heard that this game isn't worth buying, even for the measly 40 rubles it's being sold for. And that even a Uwe Boll film would be better than this game.
And yes, the film is indeed better, but I disagree with the first statement.

The game is engaging. It's enjoyable to shoot, has great music, and a very cool visual style. Both the graphics and the interface are excellent. Even the third-person perspective is well-executed, in my opinion.

The plot, while disjointed and unfinished, is divided into three endings, one of which is crap, and the others are simply boring to get, but there is a plot, and it's... well, okay. There are jokes, and they're funny. And the game takes 3-4 hours to complete, just like the first two games. But unlike those, there are some questionable moments, like the incredibly boring tutorial.

I encountered exactly zero bugs. Perhaps I was lucky, but there wasn't a single problem.

But the game still deviates greatly from the original. Obviously, Postal's film is a much bigger inspiration than the first two games. But the developers know the plot, as they accurately recounted it at the beginning.
I don't know why they did this, because the film itself, while very much in the spirit of Postal, strayed too far from it. It's the same story here. But at least the guy is similar to the original.

Postal 3 is worth buying for 40 rubles if you like Postal, and especially if you liked the film. As of today, you can play it from start to finish. It's possible, but not necessarily necessary."

It was a pirated copy. Oddly enough, I really liked it back then, although even then it was considered trash, to put it mildly. There were minimal bugs. I completed it about six times, getting both endings (Bad and Good). And now, 13 years later, I'm already 30. I decided to play the licensed version on Steam. The game was dirt cheap. Why not? What can I say about it in 2024? I completed the game once, getting the good ending, in 3 hours. During that time, there were 3 critical errors and 4 crashes. Dozens of bugs. And most importantly, about 10 achievements didn't count. They simply don't work. The game is completely empty, uninteresting, stupid, boring, and dull. Completely different emotions after 13 years.

Postal 3, farklı bir yapımcı tarafından yorumlanan, Postal 2'nin ardından gelen ve büyük bir hayal kırıklığı yaratan bir devam oyunu. Kara mizahı, absürtlüğü ve özgür dünyasıyla tanıdığımız serinin bu oyunu, ne yazık ki hiçbir beklentiyi karşılayamıyor.

Postal 3, önceki oyunun cesur mizah anlayışından ve özgün yapısından oldukça uzak. Kontroller rezalet, oyun mekanikleri hantal, mizah ise sanki zoraki yerleştirilmiş gibi. Postal 2'nin o özgür, kaotik ve çılgın atmosferinden eser yok. Harita kısıtlı, oynanış sıkıcı, üstelik sürekli karşılaşılan teknik sorunlar oyuncuyu adeta oyundan soğutuyor.

175699458,brazilian,2024.08.24 22:53,❌,✅,0.5754386187,5,"AVISO, essa review de merda sobre esse jogo de merda vai ter spoiler pra caralho, principalmente do Postal 3, e uns pouquíssimos sobre os outros, você foi avisado.

Eu iria jogar o jogo completo antes de fazer a review, mas eu acabei desistindo dessa ideia de tão ruim e patético que esse jogo é. Eu tô pouco me fudendo sobre o resto da história, o único motivo que eu comprei esse jogo foi pra ter todos os jogos da franquia Postal, EU ME ARREPENDO AMARGAMENTE.

Coisas que eu gostei do jogo:
Apesar desse jogo ser a pior coisa que eu joguei desde que eu nasci, tem algumas (poucas) coisas que eu gostei desse jogo.

* O sistema de karma - Pelo o que eu saiba (não vi gameplay do Postal 4 e nem do Brain Damaged pra saber direito) esse é o único jogo dessa franquia que genuinamente tem um sistema que suas escolhas importam (eu não tô contando o Paradise Lost porque literalmente a única coisa que muda se você jogar o jogo INTEIRO sem matar UMA pessoa é uns dialogo diferenciado na boss fight contra a Bitch), mesmo que faça literalmente nenhum sentido o DUDE ser um POLICIAL no jogo (eu vejo o Dude como um cara neutro, mas ai vai pra visão de cada pessoa e que se foda).

* Aba pra ver os objetivos das missões - No Postal 2 e Paradise Lost (se o Mike J, vulgo coproprietário da RWS considera o Paradise Lost trata o Paradise Lost como outro jogo, eu também vou) pra você ver os objetivos das missões você tem que apertar o mapa pra ver os objetivos, é algo demorado? Nem tanto, mas só o fato de você poder continuar jogando o jogo sem ter que ""pausar"" pra ver os objetivos é libertante... ou melhor, seria se o jogo em questão não fosse o Postal 3.

* O modelo do Postal Dude - Tem alguma coisa nesse modelo que eu acho melhor doq o do Postal 2 e do Postal 4 (só perde pro Dude do Postal Brain Damaged).

Coisas que odiei do jogo:
Depois de dar 3 minúsculas colheres de chá pra essa merda de jogo do caralho, bora pro que interessa.

* A IA patética e estupida desse jogo - Se você pegasse uma criança de 3 anos pra fazer a IA desse jogo, ela iria fazer algo melhor. Eu perdi a conta de quantas vezes eu vi NPC inimigo ignorando o Dude, NPC inimigo atirando no chão, NPC amigo sendo uns retardados do caralho, NPC inimigo estando com uma fucking PISTOLA e fazendo questão de chegar perto pra caralho do Dude pra atirar, é cada pérola de merda que a IA desse jogo traz que eu quis me matar.

* As missões repetitivas, sem sal e claramente feitas pra você não poder reembolsar esse jogo - Puta que pariu, as missões desse jogo, eu originalmente comprei esse jogo tanto porque queria ter todos os jogos da franquia Postal e tanto porque eu achei que seria aquele jogo ruim engraçado, mas eu tava errado, puta que pariu, como eu tava MUITO errado. Todas as missões são praticamente as mesmas, o Dude vai lá, acontece alguma merda no lugar que ele foi e ele tem que matar (ou usar o taser se você for delirado o suficiente pra querer fazer o final pacifista) um monte de npc aleatório e acaba a missão, toda, santa, missão. Provavelmente tem alguma boss fight pra frente, mas agora eu não tô com saco pra verificar essa merda. Aproveitando que eu tô falando de missão, quem foi o filho da puta do caralho que decidiu colocar uma missão que tu tem que matar 20 animais? Aquelas merda tem nem hitbox direito.

* As missões claramente não balanceadas - Isso pode ser só porque eu sou ruim mesmo, mas caralho, eu quero saber quem foi o filho da puta que decidiu que seria uma boa ideia colocar na SEGUNDA missão do jogo pro Dude resgatar 15 gatos enquanto uns chinês arrombados querem matar o Dude. Brother, o Dude sequer tem arma direito nesse ponto do jogo. É um spam de inimigo tão fudido em toda missão que tem mod feito pra balancear os objetivos. E sabe qual o pior? Esse jogo sequer tem uma seleção de dificuldade. Ou tu joga essa porra desbalanceada, ou instala mod, ou simplesmente não joga (recomendo a ultima), simplesmente ridículo. 

* O humor sem sal pra caralho - Nem parece que eu tô jogando um jogo do Postal. Eu genuinamente não consigo lembrar de nenhuma cena engraçada nesse jogo, e olha que no Paradise Lost teve piada de merda.

* O spam de cutscene - A cada 2 minutos de gamplay é 5 cutscenes, quem foi o retardado que achou que seria uma boa ideia colocar tanta cutscene no jogo?

* TU NÃO CONSEGUE PULAR - A Trashmasters (depois de jogar o jogo eu entendi o porque do nome) achou que seria uma ideia tirar uma mecânica BÁSICA de um jogo e invés disso colocar uma mecânica de que você precisa chegar perto de um objeto, apertar o botão de agachar (que por sinal só funciona se você estiver perto de um objeto) e SE o objeto for alto o suficiente, aperta denovo que o Dude vai passar por cima. E ainda por cima, tem a mecânica de correr, que quando você corre por cima de um inimigo, ele vai cair, que seria uma mecânica até que legal SE A TELA NÃO FICASSE BALANÇANDO QUE NEM MEU PAU ÁS 3 DA MANHÃ QUANDO TU CORRE.

* Os mapas vazios - Invés de seguir com UM estilo de jogo (linear ou mundo aberto) esse imbecis decidiram juntar os dois, dai em algumas missões o jogo é linear, e no outro é LINEAR E MUNDO ABERTO AO MESMO TEMPO. Essas porra desses mapas são tão vazios que eu tenho certeza que eu no Microsoft Paint faria um design melhor, resumindo, as cidades são prédio, asfalto, lojinha, e mais nada. Sem casa pra você ir dentro e roubar, sem banco pra também roubar, NADA.

* Conquistas não funcionam - Você quer fazer o 100% nesse jogo? Que pena, você vai ter que usar aplicativo pra desbloquear conquista na Steam pra isso.

* Crashes constantes - Era pra eles terem arrumado isso em um patch recente (junto com as conquistas), arrumou? Não. Eu não joguei o jogo antigamente, provavelmente tava pior, mas puta que pariu, ainda sim, ta crashando MUITO.

* Por que esse jogo é em terceira pessoa? - Como se não bastasse o sistema de ""luta"" ridículo, eles ainda vão lá e decidem fazer um jogo em TERCEIRA PESSOA em uma engine feita para jogos de PRIMEIRA PESSOA, eu nem teria tanto problema com isso, se ao menos fosse bom feito, é de fuder,

Tem muito mais coisas que eu poderia ter falado nessa review, mas honestamente, eu já gastei mais tempo do que eu deveria, tanto jogando o jogo quanto escrevendo essa review. 

Se eu consegui convencer ao menos UMA pessoa a não comprar esse jogo, eu já vou ficar feliz. Se você quer jogar uma continuação BOA do Postal 2, compra o Paradise Lost. É o mesmo preço mas é muito melhor (se o seu PC for meio antigo talvez o Paradise Lost crashe quando vc iniciar, mas tem alguns tutorias na internet de como resolver isso).","WARNING: This shitty review of this shitty game will contain a ton of spoilers, especially for Postal 3, and a few for the others. You've been warned.

I was going to play the full game before writing this review, but I ended up giving up on that idea because it's so bad and pathetic. I don't give a damn about the rest of the story; the only reason I bought this game was to have all the games in the Postal franchise. I BITTERLY REGRET IT.

Things I liked about the game:
Although this game is the worst thing I've played since I was born, there are a few (few) things I liked about it.

* The karma system - As far as I know (I haven't seen gameplay from Postal 4 or Brain Damaged to know for sure), this is the only game in this franchise that genuinely has a system where your choices matter (I'm not counting Paradise Lost because literally the only thing that changes if you play the ENTIRE game without killing ONE person is some different dialogue in the boss fight against Bitch), even though it makes literally no sense for DUDE to be a COP in the game (I see Dude as a neutral guy, but that depends on each person's perspective and who cares).

* Tab to view mission objectives - In Postal 2 and Paradise Lost (if Mike J, aka co-owner of RWS, considers Paradise Lost to be another game, I do too), to see the mission objectives you have to tap the map to see the objectives. Is it time-consuming? Not really, but just the fact that you can continue playing the game without having to ""pause"" to see the objectives is liberating... or rather, it would be if the game in question weren't Postal 3.

* The Postal Dude model - There's something about this model that I think is better than the ones in Postal 2 and Postal 4 (second only to the Dude from Postal Brain Damaged).

Things I hated about the game:
After giving this shitty game three tiny teaspoons of criticism, let's get down to business.

* The pathetic and stupid AI in this game - If you got a 3-year-old to design this game's AI, they'd do better. I've lost count of how many times I've seen enemy NPCs ignoring the Dude, enemy NPCs shooting at the ground, friendly NPCs being fucking retarded, enemy NPCs wielding a fucking GUN and insisting on getting so close to the Dude to shoot. The AI ​​in this game is so damn shitty that I wanted to kill myself.

* The repetitive, tasteless missions, clearly designed to make you unable to refund this game - Holy shit, the missions in this game. I originally bought this game so much because I wanted to own every game in the Postal franchise and so much because I thought it would be that funny, bad game, but I was wrong, holy shit, I was SO wrong. All the missions are practically the same: the Dude goes there, something bad happens where he went, and he has to kill (or taser if you're delusional enough to want the pacifist ending) a bunch of random NPCs, and then the mission, the whole damn mission, ends. There's probably a boss fight coming up, but I don't feel like checking that shit out right now. While I'm on the subject of missions, who the fuck decided to put a mission where you have to kill 20 animals? That shit doesn't even have a proper hitbox.

* The clearly unbalanced missions - This might just be because I'm bad, but damn, I want to know who the fuck decided it would be a good idea to put the game's SECOND mission for Dude to rescue 15 cats while some Chinese jerks want to kill Dude. Bro, Dude doesn't even have a proper weapon at this point in the game. He's such a fucked-up enemy spam in every mission that there's a mod made to balance the objectives. And you know what's worse? This game doesn't even have a difficulty setting. You either play this unbalanced shit, install a mod, or just don't play (I recommend the latter), it's simply ridiculous.

* The completely unbalanced humor - It doesn't even feel like I'm playing a Postal game. I genuinely can't think of a single funny scene in this game, and Paradise Lost had some really shitty jokes.

* Cutscene spam - Every 2 minutes of gameplay, there are 5 cutscenes. Who was the retard who thought it would be a good idea to put so many cutscenes in the game?

* YOU CAN'T JUMP - Trashmasters (after playing the game, I understood the name) thought it would be a good idea to remove a BASIC mechanic from a game and instead put in a mechanic where you need to get close to an object, press the crouch button (which, by the way, only works if you're close to an object), and IF the object is high enough, press it again and the Dude will walk over it. And on top of that, there's the running mechanic, which means when you run over an enemy, they'll fall, which would be a pretty cool mechanic IF THE SCREEN DIDN'T JOLLY SHAKE LIKE MY DICK AT 3 AM WHEN YOU RUN.

* The empty maps - Instead of sticking with ONE game style (linear or open world), these idiots decided to combine the two. So, in some missions, the game is linear, and in others, it's LINEAR AND OPEN WORLD AT THE SAME TIME. These damn maps are so empty that I'm sure I could design them better in Microsoft Paint. In short, the cities are just buildings, asphalt, little shops, and nothing else. No houses to go into and rob, no banks to rob, NOTHING.

* Achievements don't work - Want to get 100% in this game? Too bad, you'll have to use an achievement-unlocking app on Steam for that.

* Constant crashes - They should have fixed this in a recent patch (along with the achievements). Did they? No. I haven't played the game back then, it was probably worse, but damn, it still crashes A LOT.

* Why is this game in third person? - As if the ridiculous ""fighting"" system wasn't enough, they even decided to make a THIRD PERSON game in an engine designed for FIRST PERSON games. I wouldn't even have that much of a problem with that, if only it were well-made. It's a pain.

There are so many more things I could have said in this review, but honestly, I've already spent more time than I should have, both playing the game and writing this review.

If I can convince even ONE person not to buy this game, I'll be happy. If you want to play a GOOD sequel to Postal 2, buy Paradise Lost. It's the same price but it's much better (if your PC is a bit old, Paradise Lost might crash when you start it, but there are some tutorials on the internet on how to solve this)."

175405512,russian,2024.08.21 01:34,❌,✅,0.4788720012,1,"Postal III - это игра, которая вызывает разочарование и негативные эмоции у игроков. Начнем с графики - она устарела даже на момент выпуска игры, текстуры выглядят размыто и недоработано, а анимация персонажей кажется дешевой и неубедительной. Это создает ощущение, что игра отстает от современных стандартов и не приносит удовольствия визуально.

Сюжет Postal III также оставляет желать лучшего. Он кажется бессмысленным, нелепым и часто оскорбительным. Персонажи не вызывают симпатии, а их действия и диалоги часто кажутся примитивными и неуместными. Отсутствие интересного повествования делает игровой процесс монотонным и скучным.

Геймплей Postal III также оставляет желать лучшего. Управление кажется неудобным и неинтуитивным, что затрудняет прохождение игры. Боевая система оказывается унылой и однообразной, а задания часто сводятся к простому убийству врагов без какой-либо стратегии или тактики.

Технические проблемы также присутствуют в Postal III. Игра часто вылетает, зависает или работает нестабильно, что создает дополнительные неудобства для игроков. Отсутствие поддержки со стороны разработчиков делает исправление этих проблем практически невозможным.

В целом, Postal III - это игра, которая не заслуживает вашего времени и внимания. Она не предлагает ничего нового или интересного, а скорее вызывает разочарование и отвращение. Если вы цените качественные игры с хорошим сюжетом, геймплеем и графикой, то лучше обойти стороной эту игру и выбрать что-то более достойное вашего внимания.","Postal III is a game that leaves players frustrated and negative. Let's start with the graphics – they were outdated even at the time of release, with textures looking blurry and unpolished, and character animations feeling cheap and unconvincing. This creates a feeling that the game is lagging behind modern standards and is not visually enjoyable.

The plot of Postal III also leaves much to be desired. It feels pointless, absurd, and often offensive. The characters are unlikable, and their actions and dialogue often feel primitive and inappropriate. The lack of an engaging narrative makes the gameplay monotonous and boring.

The gameplay of Postal III also leaves much to be desired. The controls feel awkward and unintuitive, making progression difficult. The combat system is dull and repetitive, and missions often boil down to simply killing enemies without any strategy or tactics.

Technical issues are also present in Postal III. The game frequently crashes, freezes, or becomes unstable, creating additional inconvenience for players. The lack of developer support makes fixing these issues nearly impossible.

Overall, Postal III is a game that doesn't deserve your time or attention. It offers nothing new or interesting, but rather disappoints and disgusts. If you value high-quality games with good storytelling, gameplay, and graphics, it's best to avoid this game and choose something more worthy of your attention."

175290152,english,2024.08.19 12:04,❌,✅,0.5251559615,4,"Oh shit, where to start?

I purchased this game on sale (oh Steam Holiday sale, thou art a fickle temptress), and I wouldn’t have had it any other way. Except maybe having never purchased it at all, of course.

If you do a quick search of any other reviews of this game, you’re liable to find a whole lot of slander. And it’s sort of difficult to blame them. Rather than do the usual review format, I’m going to take you on a timeline breakdown of the shitstorm I endured to beat the game.

There’s a narrative string beginning at the start of the game with “Postal Dude” being interviewed by someone. This serves as a decent way to recap the previous game’s events in comic panel style, which also gives a bit of narration between missions. It actually comes across rather well, but can do little to save this game from itself, beginning with the tutorial mission.

The tutorial mission briefly introduces the new cover system, using grenades and using the gas can and match combo. The cover system is mildly important as Postal 3 has no health packs, but it does have auto-regenerating health. This takes away from some of the chaos as all you have to do to heal up is to duck out of combat for a little while, but since most of the enemies you’ll face in the game are quickly defeated with one or two shots to the face, you honestly shouldn’t ever have to use cover unless you have crap aim or find yourself up against a dozen enemies at once.

Somehow, the gas can has actually gotten worse from a tech standpoint from the previous game. Even in the tutorial level where three zombies are ambling around in a pit, it’s extremely difficult to see where the gas has landed and if any is sticking to the ground or enemies. Even after emptying half a tank and throwing a half dozen matches, nothing caught fire. I ended up dancing around the pit and trying over and over for almost five minutes, as you cannot move on until the zombies are dead. This was about as shitty a first impression as you could get.

After escaping the fallout of the town from Postal 2, you end up in the city of Catharsis, possibly the only clever thing this game does. Unfortunately, the bad tutorial turns into a worse first mission as you’re employed at a local sex shop and given a shop vac to clean up the patrons’ many discarded spunk rags around the place. The shop is raided by hockey moms, whose leader looks suspiciously like a failed vice presidential candidate, and since you’ve been given no weapons so far, your only means of recourse is to shoot spunk rags from your shop vac at the hockey moms to repel them. It’s a bit unfair as some of them have pistols, and you have to protect the shop owner from dying. There might be some cheap thrill here with polygon tits, but anything graphically sexual has been censored so the first mission is just a tease of a mundane game to come.

The mediocrity continues in mission two as you’re given a single can of “industrial strength” catnip to subdue a bunch of crazed, HIV-positive cats before picking them up. There’s more catnip to be found near the mission start area, but the game has no helpful arrows or glowing item locators to assist with any mission objectives. To make matters even worse, after you pick up three of the angry felines, “the guys from the mexi-sushi place” (literally, Asian guys wearing giant sombreros ) come at you with machetes, pistols and assault rifles for stealing their “stock”. It’s impossibly unfair, as all you have is your fists, the non-damage-dealing shop vac, and a handful of cats to throw at them. There’s no point in trying to run from them as they follow you everywhere the cats could be for collection, so it’s necessary to murder one to get his weapon and thus defend yourself from the rest.

This highlights one of the worst problems of the game: The AI is either too dumb to escape a single exit room, or they’re robotic bloodhounds tracking you down without any line of sight or noise giving you away. This becomes problematic during missions where you have to exterminate everyone to proceed, as there’s no indicator of where these moronic NPCs might be. Like the absent mission objective indicator, this serves as just another mechanism to wander aimlessly through the map until you find your goal by accident.

You soon encounter eco-terrorists, a pop culture menace that was looking pretty tired in the late 90s, and Osama bin Laden, showing pretty clearly that this game was conceived in the early 2000s. A strangely fat Al Gore also shows up, owner of a Segway dealership and repeat cameo appearance in a number of missions.

It’s all very rote. The game latches on to its two gimmicks (the shop vac and Segway driving) for a few missions throughout the game, and every other mission is a matter of either shooting or tasering everyone between you and the exit. You play bodyguard at a mall, do a delivery mission in the same mall, break out of dog obedience school, break out of an animal testing lab, break out of prison, break out of a theme park… It’s a series of flat textured office building interiors, small and poorly mapped towns, and the flimsiest of excuses to shoot people in the head.

Unlike the first and second games, there’s no sense of vengeance or even purpose to the objectives in this game. Each mission is either trying to earn some money, trying to find/free your dog or running away from the angry mob one of the previous two objectives riled up.

Most bizarrely, there’s a convoluted morality system to Postal 3. You can shoot, murder, and maim everyone you encounter like in previous games, or you can be a “good” guy by tasering and arresting people instead. Theoretically, this offers you slightly different missions and ultimately a different ending, but considering that using firearms is significantly faster than using the tazer and the whole notion of being a pacifist flies in the face of the entire franchise, it’s strange to even consider this as the preferred play style. And yet, after having finished this miserable game, I received “the bad ending” by not choosing the tazer path.

According to my Steam time played indicator, I finished off my first play-through of Postal 3 in a mere four hours, which I consider to be more appropriate for an Indie game than a full title, and yet this punchbowl full of turds is still priced at 30 bucks after being released in late 2011. Between multiple story paths and achievements which would be possible in a single play-through, Postal 3 presents itself as a full-fledged game but carries with it all the gimmicks of an XBLA game expecting multiple replays.

I can pretty safely say I won’t be revisiting Postal 3. I purchased it on sale and naively failed to check reviews, relying purely on fond memories of Postal 2.

It wouldn’t have taken very much to make this a much better game. Clear objective indicators, less use of gimmicks, a defined “one way or another” story path that you could choose in menus rather than a penalty for killing the wrong group of people, more determination from the main character… but instead we’re left with what feels like a half-finished effort, and the negatives simply drag this title down from being crude fun to being almost unplayable.

Final Score: Even if you got it for free, you’d regret wasting your time.","Oh shit, where to start?

171985108,russian,2024.07.12 23:26,❌,✅,0.5437881947,3,"Дилогия Postal компании Running With Scissors в свое время стала для игровой индустрии примерно тем же, что и провокационные киноленты студии Troma для Голливуда. Как и в фильмах вроде «Кровососущие уроды» или «Наци-серфингисты должны умереть», гипертрофированное насилие, сексуальные извращения и чернющий юмор в Postal 1-2 соседствовали с остросоциальной тематикой и злой сатирой на современное общество. Поэтому глава Running With Scissors Винс Дэйзи вслед за режиссером Ллойдом Кауфманом вполне мог воскликнуть: «Я делаю не трэш, а искусство!»

Однако когда Винс решил, что третью часть будут делать совместно с «Акеллой», начался самый настоящий трэш в худшем смысле этого слова. С российской стороны в разработке участвовала студия с подходящим названием — Trashmasters. В результате мы получили не xyлиганскую провокацию, а мусор в виде компьютерного кода, который для чего-то записали на диски и — о, ужас! — пытаются нам продать. Postal 3 задумывалась как следующий виток эволюции сериала. Если в первой части игроки оказывались в роли безумного Чувака и занимались в основном тем, что бесцельно расстреливали мирных жителей и животных в районах города, то во второй смысла было гораздо больше. Появился более-менее связный сюжет, герой мог свободно бродить по огромному Paradise City и выполнять разные задания. Винс Дэйзи пообещал, что в новой части виртуальный мир станет еще более открытым, а у игрока появится личный транспорт.

После начала партнерства Running With Scissors и Trashmasters об этих обещаниях никто не вспоминил. Вместо того, чтобы развиться в гипертрофированно жестокую вариацию GTA с четким сатирическим посылом, Postal 3, наоборот, деградировала до уровня первой части. Город Катарсис, куда Чувак перебрался после того, как уничтожил ядерным взрывом предыдущее место обитания, меньше чем Paradise City, а свободой на его улицах даже не пахнет. Вся игра — это череда примитивных миссий в нескольких районах. Суть их, как правило, сводится к расстрелу десятков клонов, да и начинаются они практически одинаково. В поисках заработка Чувак соглашается на низкооплачиваемую работу и чаще всего с помощью пылесоса убирает помет животных, яблоки или грязные платки в борделе. А потом его атакуют клоны, то есть совершенно одинаковые враги.

На улицах бесцельно шатаются точно такие же клоны мирных жителей, которых нисколько не смущают трупы ваших противников. С транспортом разработчики наших ожиданий не оправдали: прокатиться дают лишь на печально известных самокатах Seagway. Но управлять ими неприятно: двухколесные устройства ведут себя как утюги на льду. Впрочем, даже в таком виде у Postal 3 были шансы стать неплохим пародийным экшеном. Здесь можно встретить арабских террористов во главе с Усамой бен Ладеном, поработать на бывшего порно-магната, который стал мэром города, и убить горе-режиссера Уве Болла. Можно кидаться во врагов ульями с пчелами, расстреливать их из пылесоса, терзать портативным барсуком, натравливать на противников любимую псину Чувака, кошек и обезьян. Агрессивные зверушки делают с людьми очень неприятные вещи.

Для любителей традиционного насилия приготовлены дробовики, пулеметы, автоматы, гранаты и даже реализована система укрытий. Все портит исполнение. Running With Scissors напрямую в разработке не участвовала, и это заметно: сделана Postal 3 в худших традициях русских экшенов. То есть это очень глючная, неоптимизированная стрелялка с неудобным управлением (пока найдешь нужное оружие можно заработать невроз), совершенно тупыми врагами и убогим трехкопеечным дизайном. Система укрытий прикручена для галочки, а из всего многообразия оружия реально задействуется лишь пара пушек и, с позволения сказать, «гаджетов».

Как известно, глава компании, производящей самокаты «сегвеи», погиб во время катания на своем детище. Он не справился с управлением и свалился в реку. С Postal 3 случилось примерно то же самое. Из-за стремления разработчиков любыми способами эпатировать аудиторию проект скатился в неиграбельную трэш-пародию на самого себя. Если во вторую часть вполне можно было играть, и многие при этом получали, пусть и специфическое, но удовольствие, то механика Postal 3 не выдерживает никакой критики и вызывает ассоциации с кучами навоза, которые регулярно убирает главный герой. Как жаль, что под рукой нет подходящего пылесоса.","Running With Scissors' Postal duology was for the gaming industry what Troma's provocative films were for Hollywood. Like films like Bloodsucking Freaks or Nazi Surfers Must Die, the hyperbolic violence, sexual perversion, and dark humor in Postal 1 and 2 juxtaposed sharp social themes and a vicious satire of modern society. Therefore, Running With Scissors head Vince Daisy, echoing director Lloyd Kaufman, could well have exclaimed, ""I'm not making trash, I'm making art!""

However, when Vince decided to collaborate with Akella on the third installment, true trash in the worst sense of the word began. A studio with the appropriate name, Trashmasters, participated in the development on the Russian side. The result was not a hooligan provocation, but garbage in the form of computer code, which was burned onto disks for some reason and—oh, horror!—was just a waste of time. — they're trying to sell us. Postal 3 was conceived as the next step in the series' evolution. While in the first game, players found themselves in the role of the deranged Dude, primarily aimlessly shooting civilians and animals in various city districts, the second game had much more substance. A more or less coherent plot emerged, allowing the protagonist to freely roam the vast Paradise City and complete various missions. Vince Dazey promised that the new game would make the virtual world even more open, and that players would have personal transportation.

After the partnership between Running With Scissors and Trashmasters began, no one remembered these promises. Instead of developing into a hyper-violent GTA with a clear satirical message, Postal 3, on the contrary, degenerated to the level of the first game. The city of Catharsis, where the Dude moved after destroying his previous home with a nuclear explosion, is smaller than Paradise City, and there's not even a hint of freedom on its streets. The entire game is a series of simple missions across several districts. They typically revolve around shooting dozens of clones, and they all begin almost identically. Seeking a living, the Dude takes low-paying jobs, most often vacuuming up animal droppings, apples, or dirty handkerchiefs in a brothel. Then he's attacked by clones—in other words, identical enemies.

Identical clones of civilians wander aimlessly through the streets, unfazed by the corpses of your enemies. The developers didn't live up to our expectations when it came to transportation: the only rides available were the infamous Seagway scooters. But they're unpleasant to drive: the two-wheeled vehicles behave like irons on ice. However, even in this form, Postal 3 had the potential to be a decent parody action game. Here you can encounter Arab terrorists led by Osama bin Laden, work for a former porn mogul turned mayor, and assassinate hapless director Uwe Boll. You can throw beehives at your enemies, shoot them with a vacuum cleaner, torment them with a portable badger, and set your beloved dog, the Dude, cats, and monkeys on your opponents. Aggressive animals do very unpleasant things to people.

For fans of traditional violence, there are shotguns, machine guns, assault rifles, grenades, and even a cover system. The execution ruins everything. Running With Scissors wasn't directly involved in the development, and it shows: Postal 3 is made in the worst traditions of Russian action games. In short, it's a very buggy, unoptimized shooter with awkward controls (you can get neurotic while you're trying to find the right weapon), completely stupid enemies, and a pathetic, cheap design. The cover system is just there for show, and of the wide variety of weapons, only a couple of guns and, dare I say it, ""gadgets"" are actually useful.

As you know, the head of a company that produces Segways died while riding his creation. He lost control and fell into a river. A similar thing happened with Postal 3. Due to the developers' desire to shock the audience at any cost, the project has devolved into an unplayable trashy parody of itself. While the second game was perfectly playable, and many found it enjoyable, albeit in a peculiar way, the mechanics of Postal 3 are completely unsatisfactory and evoke associations with piles of manure that the main character regularly cleans up. It's a pity that there is no suitable vacuum cleaner at hand."

171319850,russian,2024.07.03 02:42,❌,✅,0.6005326509,5,"Перед тем, как я решил запустить эту игру, я посмотрел кучу видео про то, насколько эта игра ужасная, а как только решил сам поиграть и понять, что там такого, то пришел к мысли о том, что эта игра - сомнительная, однако не настолько невыносимое, как говорят многие. 

Достижения в этой игре мега крутые конечно же в плохом смысле, поскольку это был мой первый раз, когда приходилось ради заветной бесполезной медальки очень много где искать инфу, чтобы понять, насколько же сильно всё поломано и брошено на произвол судьбы. Я не застал момента, когда были некоторые достижения, которые по задумке несложные, но их было дико трудно получить из-за их кривизны, а также некоторые работали очень странным и безумным образом, но застал момент, в котором сами рвс, которые 4 частью меня выбесили конкретно, решили забрать игру и немножко её починить, в итоге поломав к чертям собачьим сюжетные достижение безумно тупым образом: в коде игры треш мастера указали, что нужно отключить одну строку с помощью определённой цифры, из-за которой много глюков, а рвс, видимо не понимающие, что там было написано, решили это дело включить, именно по этой причине придется лезть в код игры и вручную исправлять наитупейший косяк, который появился даже не из-за мастеров. 

С музыкой дело спорное: её видимо все хвалят, но вот я некоторые композиции люблю, а некоторые ощущаются так, будто они вообще не подходят игре и вставлены случайно. 

Немного слов про этот пункт: туториал... Эх, сделать такое плохое своей кривизной и тупостью вступление игры надо ещё постараться. Ну вот на кой хер нужно учиться кидать гранаты, поджигать мега убогим напалмом зомби, стрелять перцовкой в лицо солдат и так далее? 

Оружия в этой игре много, даже наверное слишком много бесполезного для игрока, хотя для меня это не то чтобы какая-то проблема. Мне например нравится барсук: оружие крутое по концепции, по внешнему виду, по дамагу, хотя даже оно работает косо-криво. Гранаты к слову хотя бы сделаны хорошо без шуток и ими даже можно адекватно пользоваться, в отличие от других частей, где они особо не полезны. 

Графика мне в этой игре к слову очень даже нравится, не буду спорить. Сам город Катарсис очень даже интересен в плане дизайна, но идея того, что чтобы свободно по нему ходить, нужно обязательно пройти игру, которая буквально слишком прямолинейная (есть 2 линии сюжета, но они все равно прямолинейными остаются). Люди выглядят...нормально впринципе, лично мне кажется только, что старики и жирные (то есть в меру упитанные) как будто слишком карикатурные, поэтому только они мне не нравятся. Во всяком случае графика всего, что есть в тройке, на порядок выше всего, что есть в четвëрке. 

Нарисованные катсцены  - нормально впринципе, остальные - фи. Возможно по началу вызывают гыгы гага, но потом надоедают постоянным звуком хлыста вместе с несмешными надписями на каждый случай жизни, бессмысленными гегами, убогим фильтром недо-комикс стиля. Даже говорить не буду, что в этих театральных постановках происходит какой-то слишком дурацкий сюр, из-за которого тратить на это своё время мне не хочется, хотя скажу, что в 4 части тоже какая-то залупа происходит, только там ситуация ещë хуже. Озвучка оригинальная - нормально впринципе, а русская - фи. Куражик возможно кому-то может вызвать ржомбу, но он меня уже с самого начала выбешивал очень сильно, но тем не менее я игру с ним и прошел. Потом только я узнал, что в файлах оригинальная версия есть, но во время игры в неё время не засчитывается. В ней к слову у чувака прикольный актер озвучки, он мне наверное даже больше нравится, чем в других частях, но это так, имхо. 

Геймплейные фичи... Так, у нас тут зачем-то постоянная тряска во время бега, вместо разного вида хилок ты хилишься со времем сам по себе непонятно каким образом, почему-то практически на каждой миссии тебе надо обязательно довести до конца какого-то тупого непися, который на месте останавливается из-за какого-то одного злого типа с пушкой или с палкой; зачем-то сделали вид от 3 лица, непонятно, с какой целью было придумано столько много боссов, которые по итогу очень кривые, некоторые вообще сломаны - для чего они вообще здесь существуют?

Как же обойтись без самого весёлого: ломка. Игра покрыта ей донельзя: это буквально одна из тех причин, которая очень сильно влияет на мое отношение к ней. Когда хочет - она вылетает, когда хочет - тогда даст злополучное достижение, ради которого ты одну и ту же миссию долбишь хрен знает сколько раз, когда хочет - делает врагов и твоих союзников слишком тупыми для этого мира, когда хочет - берет и ломает достижения за её прохождение тем или иным способом (хотя я даже этому рад, поскольку мне не пришлось ее так много перепроходить заново), когда хочет - тогда оружие может работать нормально или же криво. Игра слишком сильно недоработана и поломана почти во всех аспектах, что заметно невооружённым глазом, и меня не волнует, что там говорят те, кто ее пытаются прикрывать в этом плане. 

Когда игра даже близко не была закончена, еë начальные версии какие-то награды получали хорошие, так что  возможно она даже могла бы быть той самой НОВОЙ ПРОРЫВНОЙ ИГРОЙ ВО ФРАНШИЗЕ ПОСРАЛ, но увы, это не произошло. Игра в целом терпимая несмотря на то, как убого она работает, однако не могу скрывать свою обиду за игру, которую мы потеряли. Так сильно распространена идея того, что рвс - молодцы, что целую кучу лет поносят тройку, а акелла - заслуженно говна пожевали, однако я считаю, что все они виноваты в этом аду: рвс почти ничерта не делали, ибо почуяли, что акелла сами справятся, сделают им на халяву крутую игру и всë будет круто, а потом, когда произошло фиаско, они вроде как исправили ситуацию, обсмеяв эту игру в хорошем по моему мнению длс на 2 часть - парадайс лост; можно было после этого признать, что 3 часть - это провал, который нужен для того, чтобы следующие игры были хорошими, поэтому о нëм не надо забывать, но нет, они до сих пор продолжают угарать над тройкой, что она будто не существовал никогда, при этом выкатив несколько лет назад ещë более убогую игру, которая  реально ужасная; акелла же виновата в том, что получалась игра весьма недурной, но много раз в течение разработки меняли команду разработчиков, а ещë игру делали с нуля, при этом занимались зачастую бесполезной дичью вместо того, чтобы серьëзно работать над такой важной игрой, которая в своей изначальной смесью мрачности 1 части и веселухой 2 части могла стать чем-то уникальным. Чем больше я узнавал о всей ситуации, тем больше я ахуевал от того, как же сильно люди хотят прозрачности: эти молодцы, а эти плохие. По факту постал 3 - это производственная трагедия, в которой виноваты и акелла, и рвс. 

Итог всея рассказа таков: посрать трижды - лучше, чем посрать четырежды, ведь в первом случае диарея кончится, а во втором случае придется долго и мучительно продолжать отсиживаться в туалете, ауф!","Before I decided to launch this game, I watched a bunch of videos about how terrible it was. Once I actually played it myself and figured out what it was, I came to the conclusion that it's a dubious game, but not as unbearable as many people say.

The achievements in this game are super cool, of course, in a bad way, since this was the first time I had to search through countless places just to get a coveted, useless medal, just to understand how broken and abandoned everything is. I didn't live through the moment when there were some achievements that were supposedly easy but incredibly difficult to obtain due to their quirks, and some worked in a really weird and crazy way. But I did live through the moment when RVS themselves, who had really pissed me off, decided to take the game back and fix it a bit, ultimately breaking the story achievements in an insanely stupid way: the trash masters specified in the game's code that a line had to be disabled using a specific number, which was causing a lot of glitches, but RVS, apparently not understanding what was written there, decided to enable it. That's precisely why I'll have to dig into the game's code and manually fix this absolutely stupid bug, which wasn't even the masters' fault.

The music is debatable: apparently everyone praises it, but I love some of the tracks, while others feel like they don't fit the game at all and were inserted by accident.

A few words about this point: the tutorial... Eh, they really have to try hard to make the game's intro so bad, with its clunkiness and stupidity. Why the hell do you need to learn how to throw grenades, set zombies on fire with a monstrously pathetic napalm, shoot soldiers in the face with pepper spray, and so on?

There are a lot of weapons in this game, perhaps even too many that are useless to the player, although for me that's not really a problem. For example, I like the badger: it's cool in concept, appearance, and damage, although even its operation is sloppy. At least the grenades are well-designed, seriously, and you can actually use them effectively, unlike in other games, where they're not particularly useful.

I really like the graphics in this game, I won't argue with that. The city of Catharsis itself is quite interesting in terms of design, but the idea that you have to complete the game to freely explore it is literally too linear (there are two storylines, but they remain linear). The people look...okay, basically. Personally, I just find the old and fat (well-fed) people a bit too cartoonish, so they're the only ones I don't like. In any case, the graphics of everything in the three are an order of magnitude superior to everything in the four.

The drawn cutscenes are okay, basically, the rest are just...ugh. They might be a bit cheesy at first, but then they get annoying with the constant whipping sound, unfunny captions for every occasion, meaningless gags, and the poor, half-comic-style filter. I won't even mention that these theatrical productions are so surreal that I don't want to waste my time on them, although I will say that Part 4 also has some ridiculous things going on, only it's even worse. The original voice acting is okay, but the Russian one is just awful. Kurazhik might be a laughing stock for some, but he really pissed me off from the very beginning, and yet I still beat the game with him. It was only later that I discovered the original version was in the files, but it doesn't count against your playtime. Incidentally, the guy has a cool voice actor in it; I probably even like him more than in the other parts, but that's just me, IMHO.

Gameplay features... So, for some reason, we have constant shaking while running; instead of various healing mods, you heal over time in an incomprehensible way; for some reason, in almost every mission, you have to finish off some stupid NPC who's stopped dead by some evil guy with a gun or a stick; for some reason, they made the gameplay third-person; it's unclear why they came up with so many bosses, which are ultimately very flawed, some of them downright broken—why do they even exist?

How can we avoid the most fun part: the withdrawals. The game is covered in it to the max: it's literally one of the things that greatly influences my attitude towards it. When it wants, it crashes; when it wants, it gives you that ill-fated achievement that makes you grind the same mission over and over again; when it wants, it makes enemies and allies too dumb for this world; when it wants, it breaks achievements for completing it one way or another (though I'm actually glad about that, since I didn't have to replay it that much); when it wants, weapons can work fine or they can malfunction. The game is so unfinished and broken in almost every aspect that it's obvious to the naked eye, and I don't care what those who try to cover it up say.

When the game wasn't even close to finished, its early versions won some good awards, so perhaps it even could have been that NEW BREAKTHROUGH GAME IN THE POSRAL FRANCHISE, but alas, it didn't happen. The game is generally tolerable despite its poor performance, but I can't hide my resentment for the game we lost. The idea that RVS is great, that they've been trashing the 3D for years, and that Akella deservedly took the crap, is so widespread. However, I believe they're all to blame for this hell: RVS barely did anything because they figured Akella could handle it themselves, would make them a cool game for free, and everything would be great. Then, when the fiasco happened, they supposedly rectified the situation by mocking the game in what I consider a good DLC for Part 2—Paradise Lost. After this, it would have been possible to admit that Part 3 was a failure, necessary for the next games to be good, so we shouldn't forget about it, but no, they still continue to make fun of Part 3, as if it never existed, while releasing an even worse game a few years ago, which is truly terrible. Akella is to blame for the fact that the game was turning out quite good, but they changed the development team many times during development, and also made the game from scratch, often doing useless nonsense instead of seriously working on such an important game, which, with its original mixture of the gloom of Part 1 and the fun of Part 2, could have become something unique. The more I learned about the whole situation, the more I was shocked by how much people want transparency: these are great, and these are bad. In fact, Postal 3 is an industrial tragedy for which both Akella and the RVS are to blame.

The bottom line is this: taking a crap three times is better than taking a crap four times, because the first time will stop the diarrhea, while the second will leave you with a long and painful wait in the toilet, oof!"

3) The controls are acceptable; you can have fun and play the game normally.

At that time, I went to find the learning version resources and played to the police station, but then I stopped playing. Today, I heard that it's back on the shelves, so I downloaded it to play it, and found that it seems to have been updated and optimized, and the optimization is much better than before. Before, my 2070s 16g3200 i711700 would crash, freeze, and become unresponsive, and the more I played, the slower it got. Now my r52600 rx580 18g1333 can run at 80fps, and after playing for a long time, I can get about 60 frames, but it still crashes and becomes unresponsive for unknown reasons. It may be because it consumes too much memory. The scenes don't update automatically, and the broken limbs and arms on the ground won't disappear.

Postal 3 - игра, которая точно не оставит никого равнодушным. Она, как и ее предшественники, провоцирует, шокирует и заставляет задуматься, но на этот раз - о том, что бывает, когда разработчики пытаются угодить всем, и в итоге не угождают никому.

Что хорошо:

Черный юмор. Некоторые шутки действительно смешные, и игра смело высмеивает стереотипы и общественные ценности.
Свобода действий. Как и в предыдущих играх, вы вольны делать все, что угодно: устраивать кровавую бойню, помогать людям, просто ходить по улицам и наблюдать.
Что плохо:

Геймплей. Игра упорно пытается стать “песочницей”, но на деле это скучный, однообразный шутер с неуклюжей системой управления.
Сюжет. Слишком затянут, нелогичен и насквозь пропитан пропагандой.
Персонажи. Геймплейные “персонажи” - это скорее картонные фигурки без души, а сюжетные герои - отвратительные, мерзкие и не вызывают никакой эмпатии.
Графика. В 2011 году игра смотрелась убого, а сейчас - просто ужасно.

В итоге:

Postal 3 - игра, которая показывает, что даже самый безумный концепт может быть испорчен плохим выполнением. Несмотря на некоторые интересные моменты, она оставляет после себя гораздо больше разочарования, чем удовольствия. Если вы ищете интересный шутер с темным юмором, то лучше обратите внимание на первые две части Postal.","Postal 3: Expectation vs. Reality

Postal 3 is a game that will definitely leave no one indifferent. Like its predecessors, it provokes, shocks, and makes you think, but this time it explores what happens when developers try to please everyone and end up pleasing no one.

What's Good:

Dark Humor. Some jokes are genuinely funny, and the game boldly satirizes stereotypes and social values.
Freedom of Action. As in previous games, you're free to do whatever you want: cause a bloodbath, help people, or simply wander the streets and observe.
What's Bad:

Gameplay. The game stubbornly tries to be a sandbox, but in reality, it's a boring, repetitive shooter with a clunky control system.
Plot. It's too drawn-out, illogical, and saturated with propaganda.
Characters. The gameplay ""characters"" are more like cardboard cutouts without souls, and the story's protagonists are disgusting, vile, and utterly unsympathetic.
Graphics: In 2011, the game looked pathetic, and now it's simply awful.

Bottom Line:

Postal 3 is a game that shows that even the most insane concept can be ruined by poor execution. Despite some interesting moments, it leaves far more disappointment than satisfaction. If you're looking for an engaging shooter with dark humor, you're better off checking out the first two Postal games."

O humor do jogo é bem engraçado e que combina muito com a vibe da franquia, e as missões são divertidas, sendo a cara das confusões do dude.

The game's humor is quite funny and fits the franchise's vibe, and the missions are fun, reflecting the dude's mishaps. The downsides include, for example, the melee combat, which doesn't work well, some minor bugs (which are few and can be avoided), and the linear nature of the game, which takes away from the potential enjoyment of exploring the map.

Gdy już chciałem ją zakupić zobaczyłem, że jest to nie możliwe, gdyż gra została usunięta ze Steama. Pod koniec 2023 jednak gra powróciła na steama i to z aktualizacjami wprowadzającymi poprawki optymalizacji, zmniejszającymi ilość crashy i naprawiającymi wiele bugów, a także dodającymi kilka nowych języków gry w tym właśnie polski. Na letniej promocji zobaczyłem, że gra jest za niecałe 5 złotych więc uznałem, że nie będzie lepszej okazji. Spodziewałem się najgorszego, ale ogólnie to pozytywnie się zaskoczyłem. Zdecydowanie jest to gra zła. Nie dorasta do pięt ani dwójce ani Brain Damaged czy jedynce... Muszę jednak przyznać, że bawiłem się nie najgorzej, a nawet lepiej niż w Postalu 4. Zarówno Postal 3 jak i 4 to gry wydane w kiepskim stanie, pełne problemów technicznych, niedokończone i żyjące w cieniu legendarnej dwójki na której się wzorowały. Mimo tego jednak, Postal 3 wydał mi się bardziej dopracowany - doświadczyłem mniej crashy i glitchy niż w czwórce, a także pełen ciekawych pomysłów, jak np. wyjątkowe bronie czy 2 ścieżki z innymi misjami. Humor w trzeciej części również zdecydowanie siadł mi bardziej niż ten z czwórki, a Corey Cruise choć nie tak dobry jak Rick Hunter, to jest zdecydowanie lepszy w roli Postal Dude'a niż Jon St. John. Muszę jednak zaznaczyć, że czwórkę przeszedłem półtora roku temu, więc nie wiem czy od tego czasu jej techniczne problemy zostały naprawione.

Nie zrozumcie mnie źle, nie poleciłbym bym tej gry nikomu oprócz największych fanów serii i jeśli bardzo nie chcecie tracić czasu, to polecam zapoznać się ze szczegółami, które wymieniłem poniżej zanim to kupicie. Wystawiam jednak pozytywną recenzję, bo jak już wspomniałem bawiłem się na prawdę dobrze i gra mnie parę razy rozśmieszyła. Jeśli jesteś ciekaw tej produkcji, to (moim zdaniem) za cenę w jakiej aktualnie jest ona oferowana na promocjach na steam (około 5 zł) warto ją nabyć. Grę ukończyłem na ścieżce dobrej w około 6 godzin i właśnie przystępuję do ponownego przejścia na ścieżce złej (szalonej).
EDIT: Właśnie ukończyłem wszystkie misje z drugiej ścieżki i choć miały trochę problemów, to nadal bawiłem się całkiem dobrze. Czy podejdę kiedyś do gry ponownie i spróbuję zdobyć wszystkie osiągnięcia? Zdecydowanie nie, szczególnie że są zbugowane. Czy w przyszłości w ogóle podejdę do tej gry ponownie? Szczerze wątpię. Pierwsze przejście było jednak całkiem przyjemne, więc tytułowi pozostawiam ocenę pozytywną.

+ Wiele wyborów w trakcie misji fabularnych, jak i 2 kompletnie różne ścieżki (dobra i szalona) zawierające inne misje w zależności od podjętego przez nas wyboru w 3 misji. Niestety sporo map jest dzielonych przez obie te ścieżki ale nadal fajnie że jest taki wybór

+ Gdzieś tam nawet jest trochę ""postalowego"" (podobnego do tego z dwójki) humoru

+ Corey Cruise sprawdza się świetnie w roli Kolesia

+ Wiele zabawnych tekstów kolesia, spora część jest zerżnięta z dwójki ale jest też trochę nowych

+ Nawiązania do popkultury

+ Zaskakująco świetny soundtrack, chyba nawet najlepszy w serii

+ Zła ścieżka polega na dołączeniu do ekologów i terroryzowaniu społeczności

+ Nie najgorzej wyglądająca możliwość masakrowania ciał wrogów, nawet po śmierci

+ Możliwość ogłuszenia i aresztowania wrogów w dobrej ścieżce

+ Dosyć spory arsenał, powracają ikoniczne bronie z dwójki jak kanister z benzyną, łopata, czy bronie palne jak karabin i pistolet, ale jest też sporo nowego i bardzo wyjątkowego uzbrojenia jak np. odkurzacz, którym wsysamy odpady, a następnie wystrzeliwujemy czy też... wściekły borsuk działający jak piła łańcuchowa z alternatywnym trybem strzelania uryną, która ogłusza wrogów

- Niestety część arsenału jest bezużyteczna, gdyż jest zepsuta. Taką rzeczą są na przykład bronie białe. Ich ciosy są bardzo ślamazarne i toporne, nie możemy ich płynnie wykonywać jak w Postalu 2. W dodatku obrażenia jakie zadają też są strasznie małe (nie da się nimi odciąć kończyny albo zmiażdżyć czaszki za pierwszym ciosem nawet na zwyczajnych przechodniach, co było możliwe w Postalu 2), a przez zepsuty system aimowania w kamerze z 3 osoby często ciosy nawet nie trafiają wrogów

- Podobnie zepsuty jest kanister z benzyną, któremu zdarza się kompletnie nie działać i nie nakładać tej benzyny na nikogo. Tworzenie kałuż na podłożu tez nie zawsze działa

- Niektóre bronie podnoszą się automatycznie przy przejściu nad nimi,  jednak inne jak np. granaty czy kocimiętka wymagają naciśnięcia przycisku Użyj

- W trakcie tych 2-3 misji z eksploracją miasta, a także w free roamie dostępnym po ukończeniu gry miłoby by było mieć jakąś mapę

- Postać często zatrzymuje się w trakcie biegu o elementy otoczenia (szczególnie w budynkach)

- Brak otwartego stylu lokacji znanego z dwójki

- Pasek karmy, który choć jest moim zdaniem fajnym i pasującym do Postala pomysłem, to jest on w tej grze zepsuty. Zmniejsza się on, nawet gdy obezwładnimy (bez zabijania) cywila, który s z c z a na środku ulicy na radiowóz i nie ma żadnego sposobu na zwiększenie go (bardzo polecam naprawiający to mod - Karma Fix na ModDB)

- Dobra ścieżka (jeśli chcemy nią podążać i utrzymać nasz pasek karmy na dobrym poziomie) jest niezwykle frustrująca przez fakt, że możesz zranić a nawet zabić npc-e poprzez przebiegnięcie przez nich (sprint jest także swego rodzaju taranowaniem)

- Jest także frustrująca przez fakt, że AI npc-ów nie istnieje. I tak samo przeciwnicy jak i sojusznicy będą regularnie wchodzić nam pod celownik

- W grze znajdują się misje eskortowe i w niejednej eskortowany NPC ma tendencję do zacinania się

- Strasznie kijowy efekt zaciemniania ekranu przy trafieniu, który sprawia że gdy obrywamy serią prawie nic nie widać na ekranie. Okropnie zmniejsza to czytelność walki i niezwykle denerwuje

- Za osłonami poruszamy się zdecydowanie za wolno

- Fabuła jest kompletnie bezsensowna i głupia niezależnie od wybranej ścieżki, stanowi po prostu zlepek różnych scenariuszy

- Napisy są za małe na wyższych rozdzielczościach i nie da się ich zwiększyć...

- … nie ma również ustawień jasności

-  Mimo aktualizacji, w grze nadal są crashe. U mnie wystąpiły one w misji ze zbieraniem kotów i w misji na komisariacie (w dobrej ścieżce)

- Większość fabularnych archievementów jest zbugowana","Postal 3 is known for its lackluster quality. Despite this, I desperately wanted to play it, as it's the only game in the series I still hadn't played. When I was about to purchase it, I realized it was impossible because it had been removed from Steam. At the end of 2023, however, the game returned to Steam with updates introducing optimization improvements, reducing crashes, fixing numerous bugs, and adding several new languages, including Polish. During a summer sale, I saw the game for under 5 złoty, so I figured there wouldn't be a better deal. I expected the worst, but overall, I was pleasantly surprised. It's definitely a bad game. It doesn't live up to the second game, Brain Damaged, or the first... However, I must admit, I had a decent time, and even more fun than with Postal 4. Both Postal 3 and 4 were poorly released games, riddled with technical issues, unfinished, and living in the shadow of the legendary second game they were modeled after. Despite this, Postal 3 felt more polished to me – I experienced fewer crashes and glitches than in the fourth installment, and it was also full of interesting ideas, such as unique weapons and two different mission paths. The humor in the third installment also definitely fell flat for me compared to the fourth, and Corey Cruise, while not as good as Rick Hunter, is definitely better as Postal Dude than Jon St. John. I should note, however, that I completed the fourth installment a year and a half ago, so I don't know if its technical issues have been fixed since then.

Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone but the series' biggest fans, and if you really don't want to waste your time, I recommend reading the details I've listed below before buying it. However, I'm giving it a positive review because, as I mentioned, I really enjoyed it and it made me laugh a few times. If you're curious about this game, (in my opinion) it's worth buying for the price it's currently on sale on Steam (around 5 PLN). I finished the game on the Good track in about 6 hours and am currently starting a new playthrough on the Evil (Insane) track.

EDIT: I just finished all the missions on the second track, and while they had some issues, I still had a pretty good time. Will I ever replay the game and try to get all the achievements? Definitely not, especially since they're bugged. Will I even play this game again in the future? I sincerely doubt it. My first playthrough was quite enjoyable, though, so I'll give it a positive rating.

+ Multiple choices during the story missions, as well as two completely different paths (Good and Insane) with different missions depending on the choice you make in the third mission. Unfortunately, many maps are shared between these two paths, but it's still nice that there's a choice.

+ There's even a bit of ""post-Age"" humor (similar to that from the second game) in there somewhere.

+ Corey Cruise does a great job as the Dude.

+ Many of the Dude's lines are funny, a lot of them are lifted from the second game, but there are also some new ones.

+ Pop culture references.

+ A surprisingly great soundtrack, probably the best in the series.

+ The wrong path involves joining the environmentalists and terrorizing the community.

+ The not-so-bad option of massacring enemy bodies, even after death.

+ The ability to stun and arrest enemies in the right path.

+ A fairly large arsenal. Iconic weapons from the second game return, such as the gas canister, the shovel, and firearms like the rifle and pistol. There are also a lot of new and very unique weapons, such as a vacuum cleaner that sucks up waste and then fires it, or... a rabid badger that acts as a saw. A chainsaw with an alternate mode of shooting urine that stuns enemies.

- Unfortunately, some of the arsenal is useless because it's broken. Melee weapons, for example, are one such thing. Their attacks are very sluggish and clunky, and we can't execute them smoothly like in Postal 2. Furthermore, the damage they deal is also terribly low (you can't sever a limb or crush a skull with a single blow, even on ordinary pedestrians, which was possible in Postal 2), and due to the broken aiming system in the third-person camera, blows often don't even hit enemies.

- The gas canister is similarly broken; it sometimes completely malfunctions and doesn't apply the gas to anyone. Creating puddles on the ground doesn't always work either.

- Some weapons automatically respawn when you step over them, but others, like grenades or catnip, require pressing the Use button.

- During the 2-3 city exploration missions, as well as in the free roam mode available after completing the game, it would have been nice to have a map.

- The character often stops while running for environmental objects (especially in buildings).

- Lack of the open-world style of the second game.

- The karma bar, which, while I think is a cool idea and fits Postal, is broken in this game. It decreases even when we incapacitate (without killing) a civilian who is pissing on a police car in the middle of the street, and there's no way to increase it (I highly recommend the Karma Fix mod on ModDB that fixes this).

- The good path (if we want to follow it and keep our karma bar at a good level) is extremely frustrating because you can damage or even kill NPCs by running through them (sprinting is also a kind of ramming).

- It's also frustrating because the NPC AI is nonexistent. Both enemies and allies will regularly get in our crosshairs.

- The game features escort missions, and in many of them, the escorted NPC tends to get stuck.

- A terribly bad blackout effect on hits, which makes almost nothing visible on the screen when hit by a burst. This terribly reduces the clarity of combat and is incredibly annoying.

- We move far too slowly behind cover.

- The story is completely pointless and stupid regardless of the path we choose; it's simply a patchwork of different scenarios.

- The subtitles are too small at higher resolutions and can't be increased...

- ...there are also no brightness settings.

- Despite the update, the game still crashes. For me, they occurred during the mission where you collect cats and the mission at the police station (in the correct path).

- Most of the story archives are bugged."

cons: 
-no crack pipe... so that's why the dude says he needs the good stuff whenver he's low on health
-no food
-no proper inventory for storing found items
-crooked melee and throwing animations. you barely realise when melee's hit anything, same with throwable melees, the one's that have a longer windup time like the shovel works better for understanding when you've hit something.
-rpg is alright, the projectile is alitle slow and the impact on hiting an enemy is very meh, and the first go arounds i kept hiting myself right when firing it, until i got a hang of it! turns out i was launching it with right-click without charging it
-enemies drop to the floor with anything hiting them that could be considered heavy, like the shotgun or shovel, and some times... they dont! but as long as there wasn't a massive blood pile on the ground from that last hit, or a broken body part, or you haven't shot or melee'd them at least five times, they're probably not dead, and will get back up and try to run away or shoot you. also, melee'ing them during their get up animation may cause them to tank the hit, immediately be put in their idle animation and slide away a few feet infront of you.
-boss characters get knocked over when hit like regular citizens, though you'd think they'd just stagger instead, taken how they're supposed to be an all mighty enemy with a larger than usual healthpool
-this rhino boss is dogshit, you dodge when it charges at you and then it hits a wall and takes damage, simple enough! though sometimes he just straight up gets stuck in the wall, or decides to run into one and take damage without you doing anything at all 
-incoherent story
-shity tutorial, these zombies take forever to granade for no reason
-linear level system, meaning no open word until beating the game and unlocking free roam mode
-no tackling errands by chioce
-a morality system in a postal game. choosing to hold back back your options in a fight because the game says you should, just to get a ""good"" ending isn't gonna cut it, and quite frankly, sounds like bad game design... like wtf, 'optional fun'? 
-the escort missions are easy to get through on their own, but geting the AI npc your supposed to protect to move their ass is on a whole nother level. the first time, i'd ran through the entire mayors building, run back upstairs just to find slave ""boy"" inside the bar, unwilling to leave through the front door. so i ended up restarting and not runing ahead this time, he wen't back into the bar and refused to exit. so i took him out the back door leading to the big uhhh meeting room? court room? and that worked fine. after finishing the level and returing after compleating the game, i took slave ""boy"" into the bar by choice and sure enough, he exited through the front door without problem this time. besides that little wonky situation, he also cowers way to much, which means he will oftan hesitate to move forward, even going backwords when you desperately want him to follow you.
-unfunny jokes. such as the asians whole shtick with having dibs on the antire cat or animal population apparently, and others like ""haha, ugly soccer moms get mad at pretty woman because they look like asscrack and she doesn't"" all pretty lame and tame stuff. reused jokes also function better in postal 2, such as postal 3's ""is it politically correct to kill the women and the minorities first?"" the dude backing down and is questioning his questioning with a question he woulld't be questioning if this was postal 2, compared to postal 2's ""i suppose it would have been more politically correct to kill the women and the minorities first""
-has a cover system. also, moving while in cover mode is to slow and generaly a little wonky
-regenerating health
-this is a corridor shooter
-the game feels so easy you forget at times when your about to die because you ran in guns blazing
-after the zoom re-release, the game crashes way less than i've heard it used to (it can still happen though)

-who knew a third person source game could function so well, i remember thinking the only thing possible looking the same as going into 3rd person via console in any other source game when i was a young teen, because simple firstperson felt so distinctly source.
-the sprint to 'mouse1' attack with the shovel, hammer and axe are pretty cool! just make sure your not standing too close, or else you'll knock them over with your body rather than hiting them
-nice gun play, whrather strafing from side to side firing the m16, or runing upfront and balsting someone with the shotgun. even the standard pistol gets use! (poping heads and watching hats fly straight upwards will never stop being entertaining to me)
-the fart gun (very a-nice!)
-in the champ rescue mission, champ can properly follow the player, unlike the others...  or i don't fucking know, i just went to the end of the sewers and the game seemed to count it (maybe having champ right besides you when reaching the exit dosen't matter?)
-it actually has some pretty good music (even if allot of it is seems to be licenced or edited songs from real bands or artists) 
-the game also hsa a consistant art direction.
-after the zoom re-release, the game crashes way less than i've heard it used to.
-with the zoom re-release, updates have been made to fix bugs and help moders 
-pretty good level design, almost like it was made for a non linear game
-nades that show where they're landing before you throw them, nice!
-even though the game has a covering system, it's good for looking around corners without geting shot or just taking cover in general
-video game mockups! i love me some good game name puns. gamecave has like 11 covers that you actually get to see the front of (8 have text). all other covers are stacked sideways and with lower texture quality, so reading the lable texts can be hard
-the dudes model! i used to like his beta and alpha design more before playing the game, with how they looked more rough and tethered compared to the final model. though now, having originaly switched to the beta model after playing the first level. i just found them strangly cartoony compared to the environments in the actual game, and thus switched back almost straight afterwords.
-oh yeah, this game is modable! check 'moddb' and or 'gamebanana' for in the work or finished mods 

eveything i liked despite being bad: (or tolerated? dissmised? just didn't care about? i don't fucking know...)
-everything listed in cons
-the game technically isn't being funny most of the time with it's sexual, asian, or social comedic jokes compared to postal 2, though taking how my weird ass sense of humor can function at times, atleast i can say it 'has' a sense of humor. 

all in all, shitiest best time ever spent! the kind that makes you feel good when others hate it because ""whaaat? no way! i had no enjoyment hampering problems with that section, and you did? who could have ever thought..."", a guilty pleasure if you'd say! (and i haven't even finished postal 2 yet) the game feels like a destructive kid you can't stay mad at! basically ""cover mechanics? level starting and ending cutscenes? morality? aawww, you postal 3!"" and then he just goes ""b-b-but mom! i'm serious..."". also, would run around free roam mode again! also, killed everything and got the bad ending. also, time to listen to 'iyo iyo!' for the 100th time.

I love the Postal series, but this game disappointed me, plus the third-person gameplay isn't very user-friendly. The NPCs are dumber than hostages in the CS:GO beta. They'll lean against a table and won't move, forcing you to restart your save. It's especially frustrating when this happens at the end of a mission, and the game doesn't have autosaves. Play at your own risk, but it's better to get 4; it's much better and more fun."

[h1]немного истории[/h1]
многие наверняка скажут: ну игра была в отвратительном техническом состоянии, нигде нормально не шла, даже сейчас на топовых компах лагает. но проблема немного глубже, чем может показаться на первый взгляд.
что такое постал? 1 постал представлял некий прародитель hatred, жестоккий шутан с видом сверху, где ты без особой цели убиваешь всех. но 2 постал стал гиперболизированным, сумасшедшим, смешным аналогом гта с вагоном черного юмора и абсурда. игра была полна дебильных, но смешных решений. в какой игре можно ссать? в какой игре можно котов на дробаш надеть? все миссии представляли абсурдный, бешеный и смешной кровавый сюр, с харизматичным гг, во многом благодаря голосу Груздева. да даже гг зовут ""чувак"", намекая на то, что он конченый дебил и вообще срать на него как на персонажа. почему я рассказываю про 2 постал? причина в том, что нужно знать контекст серии игр, почему она стала культовой и завоевала сердца ГЕЙМЕРОВ. 
[h1]так почему 3 постал провалился?[/h1]
игра перестала быть безумной. возьмем первую миссию постал 2 и постал 3. в постал 2, смотря в каком порядке выполнять миссии, ты идешь в магазин за молоком, ничего не предвещает беды, но оказывается, что магазином заправляют шахиды и тебе нужно всех убить, а если спуститься к ним в подвал, то там будут бессмертные зомби собаки. а что в 3? пропуская обучение, первая миссия это собрать салфетки спермы, пострелять ими в мамаш и всё. такое чувство, будто идея принадлежала 14 летнему пацану, серьезно, стрелять спермой в мамаш. причем реализовано это максимально скучно, просто собираешь салфетки пылесосом, стреляешь, они блюют и уходят. это всё. это не сатира на что либо, к примеру миссия с магазином была утрирована, ведь в америке очень много мигрантов и мол если магазинчиком заправляет чувак с ближнего востока, то сто процентов он террорист. а 3 постал просто показывает сперму, мамаш и хаха стреляет их пылесоса. вспоминается момент из фильма идиократия, где в кино показывали зад и все смеялись. это просто салфетки спермы, которыми пуляются.
[h1]0 разнообразия[/h1]
вся игра одинакова. 0 разнообразия. в игре нет открытого мира, ты просто выполняешь миссии по сюжету. все миссии строятся на каком то гэге, ха-ха, кошки с вич, которые убивают людей, хаха. хаха, китайцы делают еду из котов, хаха. хаха, мэр это мужик и порноклуба. боже, это максимально низкий юмор, никакого утрирования, просто жопа с пальцем. само безумие стало не безумным, всё безумие заключается в выполнении абсурдных действий. повторюсь, во втором постале был обман ожиданий, ты шел на рутинную задачу, забрать книгу из библиотеки к примеру, а в итоге ее поджигали чуваки против книг и ты должен выбраться из горящей библиотеки. в 3 постале ни обмана ожиданий, ни абсурда нет. тебе сказали собрать сперму? ты ее собираешь. тебе сказали прогнать мамаш? ты прогоняешь. 
[h1]советую ли покупать?[/h1]
определенно нет. игра пустая, все кто хочет окунуться в ту атмосферу безумия, перепройдите постал 2. я ничего не сказал про техническую часть игры, ведь какая разница лагает игра или нет. киберпанк работал как параша и люди все равно радовались, потому что сама по себе игра была хорошая. да, сейчас игру немного допилили, пофиксили вылеты и баги, подправили оптимизацию, но делу это не поможет. игра откровенная помойка и я никому не советую ее покупать. такие дела","I really love Postal 2. Postal 2 became one of the most popular games in Russia (largely because it was banned in other countries). Our Russians made two expansions. One was the weekend expansion and the other was a truly awful expansion that I don't even want to talk about. If you need to, Google it. And RWS commissioned us to make the third installment because our market was their priority, and that's what we got.
[h1]A little history[/h1]

Many will probably say: well, the game was in terrible technical condition, it didn't run properly anywhere, and even now it lags on high-end computers. But the problem is a bit deeper than it might seem at first glance.

What is Postal? Postal 1 was a kind of progenitor of Hatred, a brutal top-down shooter where you kill everyone without any particular goal. But Postal 2 became an exaggerated, crazy, ridiculous version of GTA with a ton of black humor and absurdity. The game was full of idiotic, yet funny decisions. What game allows you to pee? What game allows you to slap cats on the head? All the missions were absurd, frantic, and funny, bloody surrealism, with a charismatic main character, largely thanks to Gruzdev's voice. Even the main character is called ""dude,"" implying that he's a complete moron and doesn't give a damn about him as a character. Why am I talking about Postal 2? The reason is that you need to know the context of the game series, why it became iconic and won the hearts of GAMERS. 
[h1]So why did Postal 3 fail?[/h1]
The game stopped being crazy. Let's take the first mission of Postal 2 and Postal 3. In Postal 2, depending on the order you complete the missions, you go to the store for milk, nothing foreshadows trouble, but it turns out that the store is run by shahids and you need to kill everyone. If you go down to their basement, there will be immortal zombie dogs. And what about Postal 3? Skipping the tutorial, the first mission is to collect sperm wipes, shoot them at mothers and that's it. It feels like the idea belonged to a 14-year-old kid, seriously, shoot sperm at mothers. And it's implemented in the most boring way possible: you just vacuum up the wipes, shoot them, they puke and leave. That's all. This is not a satire of anything. For example, the mission with the store was exaggerated, because in America there are a lot of immigrants, and if a dude from the Middle East runs a store, then he's 100% a terrorist. And the third one just shows sperm, moms, and, haha, shoots them out of a vacuum cleaner. It reminds me of the scene from the movie Idiocracy, where they showed a butt and everyone laughed. It's just napkins of sperm that they shoot. 
[h1]0 variety[/h1] 
The whole game is the same. 0 variety. There's no open world in the game, you just complete missions according to the story. All the missions are based on some gag, haha, cats with HIV that kill people, haha. Haha, the Chinese make food out of cats, haha. Haha, the mayor is a man and from a porn club. God, this is the lowest form of humor, no exaggeration, just an ass with a finger. The madness itself is no longer madness, all madness lies in performing absurd actions. I'll repeat, the second post-production was a disappointment. You were on a routine mission, like picking up a book from the library, for example, but it ended up being set on fire by some anti-book guys, and you had to escape the burning library. There's no disappointment or absurdity in the third post-production. You were told to collect sperm? You collect it. You were told to chase away the mothers? You chase them away. 

[h1]Do I recommend buying it?[/h1]

Definitely not. The game is empty. Anyone who wants to immerse themselves in that atmosphere of madness should replay post-production 2. I didn't say anything about the technical aspects of the game, because who cares if the game lags or not? Cyberpunk worked like crap, and people were still happy because the game itself was good. Yes, the game has been polished a bit now, crashes and bugs have been fixed, optimization has been tweaked, but that won't help. The game is pure garbage, and I don't recommend anyone buy it. That's how it is."

Postal is a series I've always held in high regard, even despite its controversial reputation. But being a relatively new fan of the series, I was always confused on why there was no Postal 3 listed on Steam despite there being a Postal 4. I thought it was some kind of joke, like how Goat Simulator skipped 2 and went straight to Goat Simulator 3. But after getting involved with the Postal community a bit more, I learned that there was indeed a Postal 3... and not a very good one. Skip to October of last year and RWS announces that Postal 3 would make its grand return to Steam with some fixes. So I bought it and eventually played it.
Postal 3 is a complete mess of broken mechanics, terrible writing, mind-numbing gameplay and enough bugs and glitches in it to make you want to punch a hole through your monitor. First, why is this a cover shooter? I get that at this point each Postal game had experimented with a different subgenre of shooter (Postal 1 was a twin-sticks shooter, Postal 2 was an FPS) but if you're going to make a cover shooter at least make the cover mechanic damn work! This thing is completely useless in the game, not only because its much more effective to just get right up in the enemies faces but also because the enemies will just go behind whatever you're covering yourself with and shoot you anyway. On the topic of enemies, the AI in this game are incredibly annoying to deal with. The enemies themselves constantly chase you around whatever map you're on instead of actually moving to spots to try and shoot you, the random NPC civilians constantly get in the way of your gunshots which affects the karma system (which I'll get to because its complete bullshit) and NPCs that you're meant to protect during escort missions will not following you and instead actively try and get into fights with the enemies. The gameplay itself is insanely bad. There is a reason the Source Engine is only really used for FPS games and this game is proof of that. Trying to aim with your gun is like trying to push a boulder with your legs. It is incredibly stiff for no reason, making it somehow more effective to just not aim at enemies and just shoot at them normally. Not that it even matters because there is no gunplay in this game at all. You can very much just beat the entire game with only the AR because of how ridiculously overpowered it is with its rapid fire and that you get crazy amounts of ammo for it throughout the game, rendering all other guns useless.
Now that karma system I mentioned. Why would you add a karma system where you lose good boy points by killing civilians in a POSTAL game?! You know, the game series that built its reputation up by making it so you are neither rewarded or punished for killing innocent NPCs and all comes down to how far you're willing to go? Yeah, lets add a karma system in the next game! I'm sure that doesn't completely go against everything the series is known for! Not to mention this karma system does nothing to affect the actual gameplay and only leads to one of two different endings depending on if you were good or bad. And both of them are shit.
I knew going into this game that it was bad but I'm still shocked at how a game like this can even be released in the state its in. I can see why RWS never licensed the Postal IP out again until Brain Damaged because I wouldn't trust anyone with my property if they made something like this out of it.

新天地カタルシスにて大暴れする悪名高きクソゲーポスタル2の続編。
日本語あり。

良いところ
DRMが削除されたので一応クリアまで動作するようになった。
コミック風のイラストアート。

悪いところ
自由度がないステージ制。
やはり動作不安定。
バグだらけ。
まともに動作しないNPC。
退屈なゲームプレイ。

クリア済。
2011年に発売されDRMの不具合でまともにプレイできない状態が長年続き
2022販売停止から2023年にNO-DRMアップデートにてDRM削除で一応ゲームが動作するようになった。
私感ではあくまでも一応動作するといった感じで
HD解像度(1280*720）からフルHD解像度にしたらゲームが落ちまくって解像度をもとに戻しても
敵の攻撃とこちらの攻撃が同時になりマズルフラッシュでゲーム停止→そのままPCがブルースクリーンに
などがあり安定動作とは程遠い。(ひさびさにPCでブルースクリーンを見たわ。)
つかプレイするたびに動作が不安定になりプレイ前に毎回ファイルの整合性チェックを行うと
毎回何かしらゲームファイルが破損してるのだが…。
バグも多くミッションを達成したのにムービーが始まらないとかNPCが止まったままとかデュードが壁にめりこみ動かないとかもあった。
NPCを守れのミッションがあるがNPCがゴール地点まで動かずこちらがちょっとずつ誘導しないとついてこない。
RTX2070のHD解像度で100～160FPSは出て快適動作ではあるのだがあまりにもゲーム自体が不安定なので目安程度に。

今回はオープンワールドを自由に動くスタイルではなくステージ制で
ミッション→ムービー→ミッションの繰り返しで自由度はなく
ミッションも〇〇を30人倒せとか〇〇を守れとか退屈なものばかり。
カルマメーターで善と悪にシナリオ分岐したりするのでやりたいことは理解できるのだが
中身が全く追いついてない。(善行してもカルマメーター善にふれないんだが…)
一応ポスタル的な悪ふざけなノリや音楽やイラスト等は良かったんだが…(ホントクソゲーにありがちだね)

第一の感想はおおっ動いたぞ！！と長年動かなかったゲームが動いたことに感動したのだが
クリア後の感想は噂通り酷いゲームだったなあ…という思いである。
DRMでまともに動作しなかったうえにゲーム内容も2011年の当時をしても平凡以下のTPS。
おまけにバグまみれ動作不安定とくればそりゃ評判も悪くRWSも黒歴史化して罵りの言葉を言うわなあと。
武器とか設定とか細かく作ってあったりとその割にみたいな未完成感が強い。
開発がやりたかったこと目指したことと開発の実力の差が出てしまった感じ。
私みたいに話しのネタにプレイする暇人ぐらいにしかお勧めできない。
まともな人はポスタル2や4をプレイすべき。","This is the sequel to the infamously crappy Postal Dude, who escaped Paradise City and wreaked havoc in the new world of Catharsis.
Available in Japanese.

Good Points
The DRM has been removed, so the game now works until completion.
Comic-style illustrations.

Bad Points
Stage system with no flexibility.
Unstable as expected.
Full of bugs.
NPCs that don't behave properly.
Boring gameplay.

Completed.
Released in 2011, the game was unplayable for many years due to DRM issues.
Sales were discontinued in 2022, but the NO-DRM update in 2023 removed the DRM and the game now works.
In my opinion, it does work, but...
When I changed from HD resolution (1280*720) to Full HD, the game crashed constantly. Even when I changed the resolution back to normal,
the enemy's attack and my own attack would occur simultaneously, causing the game to freeze with a muzzle flash, and then my PC would blue screen.
It's far from stable. (It's been a while since I've seen a blue screen on my PC.)
The game becomes unstable every time I play, and when I run a file integrity check before each play,
it always ends up corrupting some game file...
There are also a lot of bugs, like a movie not starting even after completing a mission, an NPC remaining frozen, or the Dude getting stuck in a wall and not moving.
There's a mission where you have to protect an NPC, but the NPC won't move to the goal, and you have to gradually guide him to follow.
I get 100-160 FPS at HD resolution on an RTX 2070, which is comfortable, but the game itself is so unstable that I only use it as a guideline.

This time, instead of a free-roaming open-world experience, it's stage-based.

It's a mission-movie-mission-repeated cycle with no real freedom.

The missions are all boring, like ""Kill 30 people of XX"" or ""Protect XX.""

The story branches into good and evil based on the karma meter, so I understand what they're trying to achieve, but

the content just doesn't keep up. (Even good deeds don't change the karma meter...)

The Postal-esque, playful vibe, music, and illustrations were good, but... (This is typical of crappy games.)

My first reaction was, ""Wow, it worked!"" I was thrilled that the game finally worked after years of inactivity.

But after completing it, I realized it was just as awful as rumored.

Not only did it run improperly due to the DRM, but the gameplay was subpar, even for a 2011 TPS.

Add to that the buggy and unstable nature of the game, and it's no wonder it got such a bad reputation that RWS became a dark memory and drew so many negative comments. Despite the detailed weapons and settings, it feels very unfinished.
It feels like the gap between what the developers wanted to do and what they were aiming for and their actual development ability has shown.
I can only recommend this to people like me who have a lot of free time and play it just to have something to talk about.
Normal people should play Postal 2 or 4."

写得很赶，有些地方稍微详细讲一下，其余的一句带过。

①场景：游戏地图一开始明显就是往开放世界做的，但由于资金人力短缺，最后地图被一份份地切割（早期版本看似能够通过的地方甚至只放了道空气墙，有些地方则有锥桶进行阻拦），最后呈现给玩家的就是每过一章节就生硬切换的箱庭地图，割裂感强烈（可能也有起源引擎本就不适合制作开放世界地图的缘故）。不过地图的布景其实还是说得过去的，建筑也是依照本作设定于一座美墨边境小镇一样，颇有墨西哥风格，拿来做Gmod地图还能凑合。

②操作：啧，真的离谱。不知道是不是因为本作是第三人称视角，所以游戏的空格键跳跃就被抠了（然后你会被路边台阶卡住，因为你不能跳），取而代之的功能是进入掩体。但这掩体也是毫无作用，玩家有时只能进行盲射而不能右键瞄准，而且大多数情况下敌人即便隔着掩体还能打到你……额？那我进掩体干嘛啊，当靶标吗；然后疾跑，一言难尽，跑的时候屏幕慌得不行，这种刻意营造的眩晕感真的比玩其他起源引擎的游戏还要难受；战斗也是不尽人意，近战攻击不把准心怼到人身子是真的打不到，而且Postal Dude弯腰幅度极小，变相等于你除了伤害低到不行的脚踢，其他近战是根本不能补刀的。枪械倒是一款动作射击游戏该有的正常水平，既有正常的热武器也有Postal特色的奇异搞笑的恶趣味武器，除了M-Gun那后坐力大到可以让Postal Dude身子转半圈以外，其他的还说得过去。

③睿智人机：你说人机强吧，寻路一塌糊涂，有时候战斗能把自己绊倒，敌人有时候不走到你脸上不会进入战斗状态；你说人机弱吧，人一能透视在低楼层锁高楼层敌人，二能在几十米开外激情腰射枪枪命中。很复杂，我看不懂。

④剧情：或许是受前两作饱受社会各界抨击的缘故，有且仅有本作添加了道德条属性，根据玩家的选择分别进入善线（The Good Path）亦或是恶线（The Bad Path）。进入善线，Postal Dude就能成为一名警察，尽职尽责地打击小镇的黑恶势力；进入恶线，Postal Dude就坚持一贯的烧杀抢掠，继续将Paradise的混乱散播到Catharsis小镇中去。两条线的剧情虽有相互照应的地方，但善恶线之分其实并无本质上的区别，Postal Dude打工的对象无一不是自私自利、以自我为中心的利己主义者，对Postal Dude的功劳拍拍手便抛之脑后，而一旦犯错就像踢皮球一般将其踢开。游戏进行到中期，无论善恶，Postal Dude都会质疑最初所做的选择……不知道大伙如何看待，至少我觉得两条线没有明显的基调差异真的很难让我有继续玩下去的动力，无论选哪条线都是憋屈，给人当工具人使唤来使唤去。

只能说，这次真是“I regret something”了

至于有人仅凭剧情内的讽刺要素就将Postal 3吹成系列之最，我只能说——

喜欢Postal 3，认为其是系列之最；
能够自己独立判断游戏好坏而不是单纯听游戏博主在那说一说二；
不要求玩通Postal 3，只要玩过Postal 3即可——

[h2]其三只能有其二。[/h2]

……哎，你别说，《喋血街头3》会不会是少数用起源引擎制作的系列第三部作品啊，这下曲线数三了。^_^","After completing the good storyline in the first game, you likely won't even attempt the bad storyline in the second, as the game is profoundly flawed in every way. If you've searched Bilibili or YouTube for Postal 3's development history, you'll likely understand how the 2008 global financial crisis and publisher Akella's brilliant response ruined Postal 3. I won't go into detail here. What happened next is well known to anyone who follows the series: Running With Scissors (RWS), the original IP holders, slammed Postal 3 and even refused to acknowledge it as a legitimate sequel. So, 12 years after Postal 2's release (April 13, 2003), RWS personally updated it with the massive story-based DLC, Paradise Lost, which they considered the third legitimate sequel. As for the actual ""Blood Street 3,"" aside from P3 Dude's voice actor, Corey Cruise, who also voiced the character in ""Blood Street: Brain Damage"" and ""Blood Street 4,"" ultimately redeeming himself, this so-called third legitimate sequel appears more as a mockery than a joke in all future Blood Street updates.

This writing was rushed, so I'll go into some details and briefly touch on others.

① Scenery: The game's map was clearly intended to be open-world, but due to funding and manpower shortages, it was ultimately cut up piecemeal (early versions even had seemingly traversable areas with only air walls, while others were blocked by cones). The final result is a jarring, cut-and-paste world that abruptly switches between chapters, creating a strong sense of discontinuity (perhaps due to the Source engine's inherent inability to create open-world maps). However, the map's setting is actually quite acceptable, and the architecture, reflecting the game's setting of a small town on the US-Mexico border, has a distinctly Mexican feel, making it a passable Gmod map.

② Control: Tsk, this is truly outrageous. I don't know if it's because this game is in third-person, but the spacebar jump function has been removed (and you'll get stuck on steps because you can't jump), replaced by taking cover. Cover, however, is completely useless, forcing you to blind-fire instead of aiming with the right button, and most of the time, enemies can still hit you even through cover... Uh? So why would I take cover? To be a target? And then there's the sprinting, which is inexplicable. The screen jitters while I'm running, and the artificial nausea is even more unpleasant than playing other Source engine games. The combat is also disappointing. Melee attacks are impossible to hit unless you aim directly at the target, and Postal Dude's minimal bending means that you can't land last-hit damage with melee attacks, except for his incredibly low-damage kicks. The guns are pretty standard for an action shooter, with both standard firearms and Postal's uniquely bizarre and hilarious quirks. Aside from the M-Gun's recoil, which is so strong it could make Postal Dude spin half a circle, everything else is passable.

③ Intelligent AI: You say the AI ​​is strong, but the pathfinding is a mess. Sometimes you'll trip yourself up in combat, and enemies won't engage unless they're right in front of you. You say the AI ​​is weak, but the AI ​​can see through lower floors to lock onto enemies on higher floors, and can also shoot with impulsive hip-fire from dozens of meters away. It's so complicated, I can't understand it.

④ Plot: Perhaps due to the widespread criticism of the first two games, this is the only game in the series to feature a morality bar, which places you on either the Good Path or the Bad Path depending on your choices. Entering the good storyline, Postal Dude becomes a police officer, diligently combating the town's criminal underworld. Entering the evil storyline, Postal Dude persists with his usual rampage of looting and burning, spreading Paradise's chaos to Catharsis. While the two plotlines complement each other, there's essentially no fundamental difference between the good and evil paths. The people Postal Dude works for are all selfish, self-centered individuals who applaud his achievements and dismiss them as if they've made a mistake. Midway through the game, Postal Dude, regardless of whether he's good or evil, begins to question his initial choices... I don't know how you all feel about this, but the lack of a clear tonal distinction between the two paths really makes it hard to keep playing. Regardless of which path I choose, I feel frustrated, like a tool being tossed around and ordered around.

1. Gameplay/Mechanics: 3
2. Story/Text: 5
3. Performance/Accomplishment: 5 (The cutscene noise filter is overly aggressive, blurring and distorting, and the rest of the character dialogue is completely static and stiff.)
4. Control/Action: 3
5. Art/Modeling: 6 (One of the few areas worth praising)
6. Music/Sound Effects: 4 (The music is okay, but using the Source engine for most of the sound effects is really lazy.)
7. Optimization/Bugs: 1 (Needs community optimization mods to improve) Stable operation, otherwise crashes are the norm)

8. Difficulty/Entry Points: 10 (If you can tolerate poor optimization, welcome to jail)

9. Replayability/Durability: 2 (…don't)

10. Value/Price: 4 (It's only 3 bucks, so I feel bad about it.)

11. Bonus Points/Deductions: -0.5 (Official disapproval of this game)

[h2]Final Score: 3.9/10[/h2]

I can only say, ""I regret something"" this time.

As for those who praise Postal 3 as the best in the series solely based on the irony within the plot, I can only say:

I like Postal 3 and think it's the best in the series;

I can independently judge the quality of the game instead of just listening to what gaming bloggers say;

It's not necessary to complete Postal 3, just play it—

[h2] Only two of the three can be true. [/h2]

…Hey, you know what? Could ""Bullet 3"" be one of the few third games in the series built using the Source engine? That's a third twist now. ^_^"

166356869,polish,2024.04.31 00:29,❌,✅,0.5454545617,2,"Postal 3 to bez cienia przesady okropny chłam, jednak nie za sprawą zmiany klimatu z psychodelicznego na stricte komediowy, nie przez zmianę charakteru i głosu głównego bohatera, nie przez zmianę formuły na grę liniową. Nie, absolutnie nie. Już nawet dwie pierwsze części Postala odbiegały od siebie pod względem gameplayu jak i klimatu. Więc co poszło nie tak w trójce? Nie przesadzę mówiąc, że nie zagrało tu absolutnie wszystko poza soundtrackiem. Gra przechodziła przez absolutnie piekło w procesie jej tworzenia. Chciwość twórców, kryzyz ekonomiczny, okropne traktowanie pracowników przez Akellę, a także brak dostępu do gry przez Running with Scissors, czyli twórców Postala 1 i 2 przyczyniło się do wydania śmierdzącego, okropnego, parszywego i gnijącego chłamu, który zainfekował komputery graczy swego czasu swoją niezwykle odpychającą obecnością.
   Wszystko zaczyna się od momentu poznania fabuły, której tutaj dosłownie nie ma. Tak, postal 1 i 2 również jej nie miał, jednak wszystko tam miało swój ciąg przyczynowo skutkowy, a tutaj? Koleś najpierw chce znaleźć paliwo do swojego wozu w mieście Catharsis, potem dołącza do jednej z frakcji, odwala za nie kompletnie randomowe zadania, a potem ucieka z miasta magicznie mając już swoje wyśnione paliwo. 
   Gameplay, który został nam zaserwowany jest niewiarygodnie ZŁY. Do stworzenia go Akella musiała podpisywać coraz to kolejne pakty z istotami piekielnymi, bo nie wierzę, po prostu nie wierzę, że jest inny sposób na wytłumaczenie stanu tego aspektu gry. Misje, które przyjdzie nam wykonywać są jednymi z najgorszych, absolutnie, NAJGORSZYCH misji, jakich doświadczymy w świecie growym. Żadna z misji nie jest powiązana ze sobą, każda jest źle zaprojektowana od samego rdzenia. Koleś wykonuje coraz to kolejne zadania bez ANI JEDNEGO zabawnego gagu. Naprawdę! Misje nie prowadzą do ani jednej zabawnej konkluzji tak jak to było w Postal 2. W Postal 3 absolutnie każda misja jest nudna, żadna nie jest urozmaicona pomimo liniowości. 
  Do gry został dodany też uwaga, SYSTEM KARMY. I tu muszę przyznać twórcom koronę, bo udało im się osiągnąć najgorszy system karmy, jaki widziałem w swoim życiu. Zacznijmy od tego, że w grze występuje możliwość wyboru ścieżki. Możemy dołączyć do lokalnej policji, albo do gangu ekologów. Wybór tego pierwszego jest największym błędem, jaki możecie popełnić. To właśnie ścieżka sprawiedliwości zaoferuje nam najgorsze misje przepełnione nudą. Swoją drogą, pamiętacie systemy karmy z jakichkolwiek innych gier? Tam przecież można było go odnawiać wszelkimi sposobami. W Postalu 3 twórcy zapewne podczas projektowania rzucali do programistów kolejne bezsensowne propozycje, by tylko się odczepili i dali im dalej grać w grę pod tytułem ""Wyłów jabłko zębami z wiadra rzadkich odchodów"" i dzięki temu karmy w grze nie da się w żaden sposób odnowić, jeżeli popełniliśmy jakiś błąd. Do tego, aby osiągnąć good ending nie możemy swobodnie zabijać ludzi, nawet jeżeli bierzemy tu pod uwagę CHOLERNYCH TERRORYSTÓW. Co to oznacza? Oznacza to, że nasz arsenał ogranicza się do paralizatora, miotacza pierdów i gazu pieprzowego. Niesamowite ograniczenie arsenału przyczynia się do jeszcze bardziej spotęgowanej nudy podczas użerania się z tym fatalnym już tytułem. 
   Nawet jeżeli dostaniemy możliwość korzystania z całego arsenału, to i tak jest on kompletnie bezużyteczny. Bronie do walki wręcz nigdy nie trafiają czegokolwiek, są nieporęczne i nigdy nie mamy potrzeby, by z nich korzystać przez ich popsute działanie. Bronie palne są równie zbyteczne. Zaczynając od wyłącznie teoretycznego celownika, przez masakryczny odrzut, a kończąc na ich wątpliwym działaniu. Do teraz nie wiem, dlaczego strzelanie LPM z wyrzutni rakiet powoduje moją własną autodestrukcję. 
   Walka nigdy nie będzie dla nas czymś przyjemnym, podczas niej jedynego, czego będziemy pragnąć to odbezpieczyć granat mając go we własnym tyłku i nie mówię tu o zrobieniu tego w świecie wirtualnym.  Cały ekran zaśmiecony jest różnymi, powodującymi mdłości efektami. Blur występuje cały czas, sprint powoduje trzęsienie się ekranu, strzelanie powoduje trzęsienie się ekranu, otrzymywany dmg również powoduje trzęsienie się ekranu, bugi powoduję trzęsienie się ekranu, normalnie wszystko trzęsie i zasłania nam ekran przez cały czas trwania gry. Fatalne bronie już omówiłem, ale sytuacji nie broni tragiczne AI. W życiu nie spotkałem się z gorszym AI w grach i nawet nie wiem od czego zacząć. Pola bitwy dwóch stron konfliktu to w istocie bieg po całej mapie i strzelanie z losowych miejsc, postacie nie kryją się przed ostrzałem, czasem w ogóle nie strzelają, eskortowani NPC blokują się na ścianach, czasami w ogóle nie chodzą. Wszyscy wbiegają nam pod celownik i wiele razy miałem ochotę wyrzucić mój komputer z okna przez to. 
  Jednak największym grzechem gry jest jej stan techniczny. Nawet w 2024 roku gra jest zwyczajnie niegrywalna. FPSy potrafią spaść ze 100 do 15 w scenach akcji. Optymalizacja to dno. Gra crashuje się w losowych momentach, czasami wymusza nawet restart komputera. Przerywniki filmowe się nagle urywają, albo audio z nich i z gry nachodzą na siebie. NPCty utrudniają ukończenie misji, bo przestają współpracować. Wszystko to powoduje ataki wściekłości i niekontrolowanych tendencji ludobójczych u osoby grającej.
  Wiecie, Postal 1 i 2 nie były idealnymi grami, miały swoje wady mimo zadowalającej formuły gry, ale Postal 3? Postal 3 to istne apogeum miernoty, eksplozja tamy broniącej przed oceanami szamba. I przysięgam, przysięgam na swoją rękę, nogę, kroczę, głowę, psa i śpiącego pod pacyfikiem cthulu, że Akella, ta obrzydliwa Akella, razem ze swoimi rodzinami do końca swoich dni szorować będzie pokłady zatopionych statków paznokciami. Postal 3 to przykład gry absolutnie fatalnej i mam nadzieję, mam do cholery nadzieję, że nigdy nie powstanie kolejna tak bardzo okropna odsłona tej serii jak Postal 3.","Postal 3 is, without a shadow of a doubt, a terrible mess, but not because of the shift from a psychedelic to a strictly comedic atmosphere, not because of the change in the protagonist's personality and voice, not because of the shift from a linear game to a more linear format. No, absolutely not. Even the first two Postal games were already quite different in terms of gameplay and atmosphere. So what went wrong with the third? I'm not exaggerating when I say that absolutely everything but the soundtrack was flawed. The game went through absolute hell during its development. The developers' greed, the economic crisis, Akella's appalling treatment of employees, and the lack of access to the game by Running with Scissors, the creators of Postal 1 and 2, all contributed to the release of this stinking, awful, rotten, and rotting piece of garbage that infected players' computers with its incredibly repulsive presence.

It all begins with the introduction of the plot, which is literally nonexistent here. Yes, Postal 1 and 2 didn't have it either, but everything there had a cause-and-effect chain, but here? The guy first wants to find fuel for his wagon in the city of Catharsis, then joins one of the factions, completes completely random tasks for them, and then magically escapes the city with his dream fuel.

The gameplay we're treated to is unbelievably BAD. To create it, Akella had to sign more and more pacts with hellish beings, because I don't believe, I simply don't believe, that there's any other way to explain this aspect of the game. The missions we'll have to complete are some of the worst, absolutely, WORST missions we'll ever experience in gaming. None of the missions are connected, each one is poorly designed from the ground up. The guy just keeps completing tasks without a SINGLE funny gag. Seriously! The missions don't lead to a single entertaining conclusion like they did in Postal 2. In Postal 3, absolutely every mission is boring, and none of them are varied despite their linearity.

A note of caution has also been added to the game: the KARMA SYSTEM. And here I have to give the developers the crown, as they managed to achieve the worst karma system I've ever seen. Let's start with the fact that the game offers a choice of paths. You can join the local police or the environmentalist gang. Choosing the former is the biggest mistake you can make. It's the path of justice that will offer you the worst, most boring missions. By the way, remember karma systems from any other games? You could replenish them in any way you wanted. In Postal 3, the creators probably threw pointless suggestions at the programmers during the design process, telling them to just back off and let them keep playing a game called ""Fish an apple with your teeth from a bucket of thin excrement."" As a result, karma in the game can't be renewed in any way if you make a mistake. In addition, to achieve a good ending, we can't freely kill people, even if we're considering DAMN TERRORISTS. What does that mean? It means our arsenal is limited to a stun gun, a fart blaster, and pepper spray. This incredibly limited arsenal adds to the boredom of dealing with this already terrible title.

Even if we're given the option to use the entire arsenal, it's completely useless. Melee weapons never hit anything, they're cumbersome, and we never need to use them because they're broken. Firearms are equally superfluous. From the purely theoretical scope, to the devastating recoil, to their questionable functionality. To this day, I don't know why firing the left-click from a rocket launcher causes my own self-destruction.

Combat will never be enjoyable; during combat, the only thing we'll want to do is unlatch a grenade with it stuck in our butts, and I'm not talking about doing it in the virtual world. The entire screen is littered with various nauseating effects. Blur is constant, sprinting causes the screen to shake, shooting causes the screen to shake, damage taken also causes the screen to shake, bugs cause the screen to shake, and everything shakes and obscures the screen for the entire duration of the game. I've already discussed the terrible weapons, but the situation is not saved by the terrible AI. I've never encountered worse AI in games, and I don't even know where to begin. The battlefields of both sides of the conflict essentially involve running across the map and shooting from random locations. Characters don't take cover from fire, sometimes don't shoot at all, escorted NPCs get stuck on walls, sometimes don't move at all. Everyone runs into our sights, and many times I wanted to throw my computer out the window because of it. However, the game's greatest sin is its technical state. Even in 2024, the game is simply unplayable. FPS can drop from 100 to 15 during action scenes. The optimization is abysmal. The game crashes at random moments, sometimes even forcing a restart. Cutscenes suddenly cut out, or the audio from them and the game overlaps. NPCs make completing missions difficult because they stop cooperating. All of this causes fits of rage and uncontrollable genocidal tendencies in the player.

You know, Postal 1 and 2 weren't perfect games; they had their flaws despite a satisfying gameplay formula, but Postal 3? Postal 3 is the apogee of mediocrity, a dam exploding against oceans of septic tanks. And I swear, I swear on my arm, my leg, my crotch, my head, my dog, and the sleeping Cthulu beneath the Pacific Ocean, that Akella, that disgusting Akella, and her family will spend the rest of their lives scrubbing the decks of sunken ships with their fingernails. Postal 3 is an absolutely terrible game, and I hope, I bloody hope, that there will never be another installment in this series as awful as Postal 3."

Oder, um es genauer zu sagen, dass manchmal gar nichts besser ist als ein schlechtes Spiel. Aber hey, wir können ja versuchen, das Positive herauszuarbeiten, auch wenn es so dünn ist wie das Papier, auf dem die Entschuldigungen der Entwickler gedruckt wurden.

Wenn du schon immer davon geträumt hast, die Welt als durchgeknallter Psychopath zu sehen, der sich selbst und allen anderen das Leben zur Hölle macht, dann könnte ""Postal 3"" genau das sein, was du suchst. Das Spiel wirft dich in eine Welt voller Obszönitäten, sinnloser Gewalt und einem Haufen fragwürdiger Entscheidungen, die selbst den abgebrühtesten Spieler dazu bringen könnten, den Kopf zu schütteln.

Die Grafik? Nun ja, sie ist... existent. Zumindest können wir sagen, dass es Pixel gibt, die versuchen, wie Menschen auszusehen. Aber hey, wer braucht schon realistische Grafik, wenn man stattdessen eine Karikatur der Menschheit präsentieren kann, die so schmerzhaft ist wie ein Kaktus im Schritt?

Das Gameplay? Nun, lass es mich so ausdrücken: Wenn du schon immer davon geträumt hast, Waffen abzufeuern, die sich anfühlen, als würden sie aus einem Spielzeugladen stammen, und Gegner zu bekämpfen, die dümmer sind als ein Sack Steine, dann ist ""Postal 3"" vielleicht das Richtige für dich. Aber sei gewarnt: Selbst der abenteuerlustigste Spieler könnte sich dabei erwischen, wie er sehnsüchtig nach einem Exit-Knopf sucht.

Aber hey, wir sollten das Positive nicht vergessen, oder? Nun, das Ende des Spiels könnte als solches betrachtet werden - immerhin bedeutet es, dass es vorbei ist und du endlich deine Zeit mit etwas Sinnvollem verbringen kannst. Wie zum Beispiel das Anstarren einer Wand oder das Lesen von Steuerformularen. Denn hey, selbst das wäre wahrscheinlich unterhaltsamer als ""Postal 3"".

Insgesamt ist ""Postal 3"" wie eine schlechte Pizza: Es ist schnell konsumiert, hinterlässt aber einen bitteren Nachgeschmack und lässt dich fragen, warum du überhaupt angefangen hast. Aber wer weiß, vielleicht gibt es ja irgendwo da draußen jemanden, der wirklich Spaß daran hat, sich durch diesen digitalen Albtraum zu quälen. Aber für den Rest von uns? Nun ja, es gibt immer noch genug andere Spiele da draußen.","Artistic license or not, you might think that ""Postal 3"" is a reminder that sometimes less is more. Or, to be more specific, that sometimes nothing is better than a bad game. But hey, we can try to find the positive, even if it's as thin as the paper the developers' apologies are printed on.

If you've always dreamed of seeing the world as a crazed psychopath making life hell for himself and everyone else, then ""Postal 3"" might be just what you're looking for. The game throws you into a world filled with profanity, senseless violence, and a slew of questionable decisions that could make even the most seasoned gamer shake their head in disbelief.

The graphics? Well, they're... there. At least we can say there are pixels trying to look like people. But hey, who needs realistic graphics when you can instead present a caricature of humanity as painful as a cactus in the crotch?

The gameplay? Well, let me put it this way: If you've always dreamed of firing weapons that feel like they came from a toy store and fighting enemies dumber than a bag of bricks, then ""Postal 3"" might be for you. But be warned: Even the most adventurous player might find themselves longing for an exit button.

But hey, let's not forget the positives, shall we? Well, the game's ending could be considered that—after all, it means it's over and you can finally spend your time doing something worthwhile. Like staring at a wall or reading tax forms. Because hey, even that would probably be more entertaining than ""Postal 3.""

Overall, ""Postal 3"" is like a bad pizza: It's quickly consumed, but leaves a bitter aftertaste and makes you wonder why you started in the first place. But who knows, maybe there's someone out there who actually enjoys plowing through this digital nightmare. But for the rest of us? Well, there are still plenty of other games out there."

Всеми известная студия ""Акелла"" вела разработку данной игры, но так как они не умеют делать игры, они передали разработку студии ""Trashmasters"" под присмотром ""Running With Scissors"". Как мы все поняли они нихуя не смотрели. Игра получилась с большим количеством багов, НО! Пока ""Running With Scissors"" тратили все бабки на наркотики и шлюх, ""Акелла"" и ""Trashmasters""  в соло разрабатывали Postal III. Какой бы плохой не была POSTAL III, в ней все равно ощущается какой-то приятный вайб, озвучка конечно не такая крутая как во 2, но все же. Приятные кат-сцены, сюжет намного сильнее чем во 2 части. Всего есть 3 концовки, которые зависят от вашего поведения. Моя субъективная оценка: 5/10. Под пивко после ночной смены на заводе пойдет.","The most controversial of all the POSTAL games. The well-known Akella studio was developing this game, but since they don't know how to make games, they handed it over to Trashmasters under the supervision of Running With Scissors. As we all understood, they didn't even look at anything. The game turned out to be heavily bugged, BUT! While Running With Scissors wasted all their money on drugs and whores, Akella and Trashmasters were developing Postal III alone. As bad as Postal III is, it still has a pleasant vibe. The voice acting isn't as great as in Part 2, but still. The cutscenes are enjoyable, and the plot is much stronger than in Part 2. There are three endings, depending on your behavior. My subjective rating: 5/10. It's a good game with a beer after a night shift at the factory."

So why do I recommend it? Because going in I expected something far worse and I genuinely had fun. There is a foundation of a good POSTAL game here and sometimes, when the game decides to actually function, it is so much fun. There's still a charm here, the music is great, corey is great, the look of the game is raunchy yet stylized. 

Postal III sucks, everyone knows that, but when you experience it you really can't help but feel like it was a labor of love that failed miserably. I don't recommend you get it unless you can get it for free or at least not more than 2 or so bucks. That being said, if you can get it for anywhere between 0 - 2 dollars, pick it up and play it, just so you can say you have instead of bashing it because everyone else does. Playing it for myself was at the very least interesting because it gave me an idea of what we could have had.

Gra, której oryginalni twórcy mieli na nią pomysł ale przez brak budżetu została dokończona przez kilku rosyjskich towarzyszy. Gra, od której nawet Running with Scissors odcina się i nie chce i niej mówić. Okrzyknięta błędem, rosyjskim bełtem i najgorszą grą w historii. Tą grą jest Postal III. Ale czy naprawdę tak jest? 
Plusy(tak istnieją):
+ nienajgorsze modele postaci, gorzej z otoczeniem,
+ aktorzy głosowi, w tym Corey Cruise jako Koleś, który zostanie w serii Postal na dłużej
+ różnoraki arsenał
+ rysowane cutscenki są świetne, chyba najlepsza część tego chaosu
+ zróżnicowane zadania 
+ muzyka wpasowuje się w klimat gry
+ czarny humor i rasistowskie podejście do każdej narodowości jaka istnieje
Wady:
- stabilność to żart
- arsenał w większości nie działa jak trzeba
- praca kamery z trzeciej osoby dostaje padaczki kiedy sprintuję
- kod źródłowy był pisany przez kogoś po wylewie
- jak humor w Postalu 2 opierał się na różnych tematykach, tutaj jest jedna nadrzędna - cimcirimcim
- gra nie jest otwarta tylko liniowa
- cutscenki na silniku gry nie starają się nawet wyglądać akceptowalnie
- system karny - jak kogoś zabijesz to idziesz na złą drogę
- zadania często nie da się ukończyć bo np wróg wbiegnie za ścianę i tyle, wczytuj od nowa
- błędy, błędy i jeszcze raz błędy
- gra często się zawiesza 
- system walki wręcz nie istnieje, potrzeba co najmniej 30 uderzeń pięścią lub 40 kopniaków żeby kogoś zabić
- fizyka odmawia posłuszeństwa
- niepotrzebny system chowania się za osłonami
- brak możliwości skoku
Jest tego więcej ale o tym można napisać książkę. 
Czy warto? Zdecydowanie nie. Nawet jeśli jesteś fanem. Lepiej wrócić do Postala 2, zagrać jeszcze raz w Postal 1/Redux lub w Postal Brain Damaged. To są o niebo lepsze produkcje. A Postal 4? Przy obecnej cenie...ciężko stwierdzić.","A game panned upon its release by fans of the series, reviewers, and the entire world. A game built on the engine of Half-Life, LFD, Portal, and other Valve games. A game whose original creators had an idea for it, but due to lack of budget, it was finished by a few Russian comrades. A game that even Running with Scissors distances itself from and refuses to discuss. Hailed as a mistake, a Russian bolt, and the worst game ever. That game is Postal III. But is it really so? Pros (yes, they exist):
+ decent character models, less so with the environments,
+ voice actors, including Corey Cruise as The Dude, who will be in the Postal series for a while,
+ diverse arsenal,
+ the drawn cutscenes are great, probably the best part of this chaos,
+ varied quests,
+ the music fits the game's atmosphere,
+ dark humor and racist attitude towards every nationality, ever,
Cons:
- stability is a joke,
- most of the arsenal doesn't work properly,
- the third-person camerawork gives me seizures when I sprint,
- the source code was written by someone who had a stroke,
- while the humor in Postal 2 was based on various themes, here there's one overarching one - cimcirimcim,
- the game isn't open-ended, it's linear,
- the cutscenes in the game engine don't even try to look acceptable,
- the punishment system - if you kill someone, you're on the wrong track,
- quests are often impossible to complete because, for example, an enemy runs through a wall, and that's it. Reload
- Bugs, bugs, and more bugs
- The game frequently freezes
- The melee combat system is nonexistent; it takes at least 30 punches or 40 kicks to kill someone
- The physics are inconsistent
- An unnecessary cover system
- No jumping option
There's more, but a book could be written about it.
Is it worth it? Definitely not. Even if you're a fan. It's better to go back to Postal 2, replay Postal 1/Redux, or Postal Brain Damaged. These are far superior games. And Postal 4? At its current price...it's hard to say."

-Boring ahh story
-Missions are mostly ""protect someone"" or ""kill enemies"" which makes the game worse
-Most of the time you cant hear anything in cutscenes thanks to loud background music
-Your settings are going to reset everytime you start the game,the problem is audio is 7.1 by default
-Audio problems I kinda solved it when I changed 7.1 to stereo but its bad if you dont know how to solve

I'm a postal fan I played postal 2 for hours to get goofy achievements without getting any boredom I thought maybe its not that bad because I played a lotta bad game with some (ok lets say a little) fun (kane and lynch,zula,condition zero etc.) when I loaded up it was cool and not gonna lie this game had great potential  when you look at some distance but omg even I'm a fan and not a ""it needs to be a good game or I refund"" guy it sucks ass so DONT BUY THİS GAME

Conclusion: I regret nothing expect the moment when I bought this game RWS if you reading this dont even try to fix just make a remake",

Я был крайне удивлен что кто то пытается оживить игру и купил её
И честно сказать игра стала мной любима и почитаема, это по настоящему реликт, чудо 00-х.
То что не может существовать сейчас, настоящий треш без тормозов. Игра, которая может перегнуть палку, и ты будешь с этого плеваться особенно с туториала который отогнал всех адекватных людей своей ужасностью, тупизной и кривизной. Но как говорится озон терпел и нам велел, и после такого акта унижения самого себя можно оценить дальнейший шизо-трип.
Сейчас в неё вполне можно играть и получать удовольствие, и мне очень жаль людей купивших тот кусок неиграбельного кода, да господи я игру прошел на макс сложности (Я EБAНУТЫЙ) 
Главное накатить пару модов на камеру (Которая всё еще ущербная без модов) и большей расчлененки чтобы прям кровь кишки кладбища черепа.
Конечно даже сейчас имеются у игры подводные камни а именно
Всё еще необходимо иногда давать по eбaлу ногой нпс чтоб он пошел по триггерам и скриптам
ПОЛНОСТЬЮ СЛОМАННЫЙ ЛАЗЕР В МИССИЯХ НОСОРОГА CУKА 
Это просто Пи3дeц товарищи чтоб пройти этих двух yрoдов надо их баговать, и я очень надеюсь на тех людей что сейчас патчат игру, что они со временем починят этот косяк и в эту довольно сносную игру возможно будет играть без каких то боль в моя дырка задница.
Я советую хоть раз попробовать каждому фанату треша эту игру, она имеет шарм и по настоящему может рассмешить и подарить эмоции своей несуразностью и искренностью.
Даже такой треш необходимо ценить в наше время, сейчас подобного просто не существует и это реликт великих 00-х со своим трешом и угаром.
(И да Посрал 4 всё же хуже чем постал 3 Change my mind) 
","A game that had been hated for 13 years has once again become popular, including with me, thanks to news of its updates.
I was extremely surprised that someone was trying to revive the game and bought it.
And frankly, I've come to love and venerate the game; it's a true relic, a miracle of the '00s.

It's something that can't exist now; pure trash without brakes. A game that can go too far, and you'll be spitting at it, especially the tutorial, which drove away all reasonable people with its awfulness, stupidity, and crookedness. But as they say, the ozone endured and ordered us to, and after such an act of self-humiliation, one can appreciate the schizophrenia that follows.
Now it's perfectly playable and enjoyable, and I feel so sorry for the people who bought that piece of unplayable code. My God, I beat the game on max difficulty (I'M FUCKED).

The main thing is to install a couple of mods on the camera (which is still flawed without mods) and more dismemberment so that it's like blood, guts, and skulls.

Of course, even now the game has its pitfalls, namely:
You still have to occasionally kick an NPC in the face to make them follow triggers and scripts.
THE COMPLETELY BROKEN LASER IN THE RHINO MISSIONS IS A BITCH.

This is just fucking insane, comrades. To beat these two assholes, you have to bug them. I really hope the people patching the game now will fix this issue over time, and it will be possible to play this rather tolerable game without any pain in the ass.
I recommend every trash fan try this game at least once. It has charm and can truly make you laugh and evoke emotions with its absurdity and sincerity.

Even trash like this needs to be appreciated these days; it simply doesn't exist anymore, and it's a relic of the great 2000s, with its trash and hilarity.

Mentira, no lo es, pero quiero salir a defender esta obra ya que al mi parecer su odio esta un poco exagerado.
Sabiendo todo el contexto detrás del desarrollo y la crisis económica que sufrió Rusia en su momento, es entendible el estado en el que se lanzo el juego, pero hoy en día es jugable [i] en el sentido literal, ya que, por los testimonios que vi, antes de los parches el juego era casi injugable por varios bugs, crasheos y pesimo rendimiento [/i]
Es cierto que sigue teniendo algunos bugs molestos y una inteligencia artificial altamente estúpida, pero hay otros aspectos en los que siento que el publico fue muy duro contra el juego.
Yo lo llegue a disfrutar por el hecho de que [i] además que lo parchee, [/i] no esperaba gran cosa, sabia perfectamente que clase de cosas me iba a encontrar y aun así llegue a disfrutarlo genuinamente [i] incluso me llegue a reír más que en el Postal 2 [/i]
Cada persona tiene sus gustos y entiendo a la gente que no le gusta Postal 3, pero quisiera invitar a las personas que no lo jugaron e incluso a las personas que ya lo hicieron, que le den una oportunidad [i] o una segunda oportunidad, [/i] ya que, a día de hoy, es una experiencia disfrutable y puedo decir, [b] I Regret Nothing [/b] about playing Postal 3

[spoiler] Algo que me falto aclarar, USEN LAS GUÍAS, si tienen un problema con algo, usen las guías de la comunidad, hay muchísimas muy útiles, como una que traduce el juego al español, otra que explica como mejorar el rendimiento, etc. No miento cuando digo que usar las guías mejora increíblemente la calidad de experiencia del juego [/spoiler]","[h2] The best Postal! [/h2]

It's not a lie, but I want to come out and defend this game because, in my opinion, the hatred is a bit exaggerated.
Knowing the full context behind its development and the economic crisis that Russia suffered at the time, the state in which the game was released is understandable, but today it's playable [i] in the literal sense, since, from the testimonies I saw, before the patches the game was almost unplayable due to various bugs, crashes, and terrible performance [/i]
It's true that it still has some annoying bugs and a highly stupid artificial intelligence, but there are other aspects in which I feel the public has been very harsh on the game.
I enjoyed it because [i] besides the fact that I patched it, [/i] I wasn't expecting much. I knew exactly what kind of things I was going to find, and I still genuinely enjoyed it [i] and even laughed more than I did in Postal 2 [/i]
Everyone has their own tastes, and I understand people who don't like Postal 3, but I would like to invite people who haven't played it, and even those who have, to give it a chance [i] or a second chance [/i] because, as of today, it's an enjoyable experience, and I can say, [b] I Regret Nothing [/b] about playing Postal 3.

[spoiler] Something I forgot to clarify: USE THE GUIDES. If you have a problem with something, use the community guides. There are tons of very useful ones, like one that translates the game into Spanish, another that explains how to improve performance, etc. I'm not lying when I say that using guides incredibly improves the quality of the game experience."

i get that the team was facing alot of economic problems due to the entire team being russian, but atleast test the game more than once, this is pathetic, would not recommend UNLESS you want to see how bad it is
in short: I regret everything."

 Если посмотреть на некоторые современные игры типа RedFall, Starfield, Руссы против Ящеров и всякие ""симуляторы"" всякого уг, то окажется, что Постал 3 был не такой уж и плохой игрой. Над ней действительно старались создавая катсцены, локации и т д. За всё время игры раздражали только некоторые баги и душноватые финальные миссии. В целом я думаю игра заслуживает каких ни-будь 5/10, потому, что на фоне современного треша это хотя бы игра сделанная с душой. Юмор в игре хоть и не "" утончённый"" как многим нравится, но и он способен заставить улыбнутся от абсурда, который там происходит)","[h1] The game is so good it's risen from the dead [/h1]
If you look at some modern games like RedFall, Starfield, Russes vs. Lizards, and all sorts of ""simulators"" of all sorts, it turns out that Postal 3 wasn't such a bad game. They really put effort into creating cutscenes, locations, and so on. The only annoying things were a few bugs and the rather stuffy final missions. Overall, I think the game deserves at least a 5/10, because compared to modern trash, it's at least a game made with heart. The humor in the game, while not as ""subtle"" as many like, is still capable of making you smile at the absurdity that unfolds."

On my first playthrough I didn't encounter many bugs (just bad coded SFX, lazy animated cutscenes, overly exagerated jokes - which all of these are the reasons why Postal 3 is awful). 

Why is it so bad? So these are what I have encountered on my 2nd and last playthrough.
Mission design. Postal 3 is standing out as a scripted story, following forced events and tasks instead of letting you explore the town of Catharsis, unlike in Postal 2 and 4 where you could free roam and explore the city/locations at your own will.

Path choices. I understand Postal 2 & 4 had pacifist options but that's different. I'm talking about Postal 3, which in it's title is about Postal dude going... POSTAL, you can choose to be a member of the law with minimal chaos. Nothing wrong with that but it feels so weird in a Postal game, also bare in mind that even the game, lets you know after finishing Bad Ending, that you should've gone for Good Path in order to achieve the best ending.

Escort Missions. Why do they exist? The VIP dies easily. Pro Tip: Just ditch the segway and follow the vip on foot.

Rhino lazer monkey missions. They're broken. Pray to God that they work in your RNG.

Health regen. Takes almost a whole minute to reach full HP. 

Weapons. The M4 is the most satisfying gun in this game. Tbh, I love the M4 more than any other weapons. The rest are barely accurate aiming or do any decent damage. Melee doesn't work. You can barely get your punches to register any damage.

The only good things I can say about this game is that Corey Cruise does an amazing job as being the voice of the Postal Dude and being part of the Postal family.","To be honest with you, I did pay 5 bucks for this game because I was curious to see how it is after I have finished played all the Postal games which were available at the time ('97, 2, Redux, 4 and Brain Damage).

Al momento de iniciar el juego corre como la MIERDA, corres como estúpido y los movimientos son toscos e incómodos. Si van a jugar este juego o le quieren dar otra oportunidad descarguen la FIXED o parche que ha hecho la comunidad (disponible en el área de discusiones). El juego es otra cosa y te permite disfrutarlo mejor a un 100/10. 

Encuentro estúpido que la misma desarrolladora no pueda arreglar su franquicia y lo dejo muriéndose argumentando de  que ""no lo hicieron ellos"" (teniendo el logo de esta en el juego). A los que somos más viejos y vimos las reseñas de este juego, antes salían con ""mayoritariamente negativo"" y claro, si dejas un juego fracasar por nada y no haces nada para arreglarlo, obvio que no va a rendir, jueguen en Postal 2 original cuando salio y verán que son la misma porquería e incluso hoy el 2 se sigue trabando si pisas mal un ca da ver o si saltas mucho. La historia de este es más ingeniosa siento yo y algo más pasiva. No vas a cagarte de la risa (porque nadie lo hace, solo es por el morbo del juego) con este o con los otros Postal. Piensa que ese es como postal brain damaged y no lo mires como una experiencia rara. (Además que quieres si es un juego del año 2011).

Les dejo un link donde si quieren pueden leer como se quiso realizar el juego y de la palabra de los mismo autores como se penso (ojo, vas a tener que comprarlo y esta en ingles): https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Postal?id=INzaDwAAQBAJ&hl=es_VE&pli=1","Postal 3 is, for many, or for the self-proclaimed ""gamer"" video game critic on YouTube, ""another Postal game, or very different from Postal."" And of course it is, I won't deny that, but it's a good Postal game as a game, not as a continuation of the franchise's story. When you start the game, it runs like SHIT, you run like an idiot, and the movements are clumsy and awkward. If you're going to play this game or want to give it another chance, download the FIXED or patch created by the community (available in the discussion area). The game is something else, and it allows you to enjoy it 100% better.

I find it stupid that the same developer can't fix their franchise, and I'll leave them dying arguing that ""they didn't do it"" (with their logo in the game). For those of us who are older and saw the reviews for this game, they used to say ""mostly negative."" And of course, if you let a game fail for no reason and don't do anything to fix it, it's obviously not going to work. Play the original Postal 2 when it came out and you'll see that it's the same crap, and even today, Postal 2 still crashes if you step wrong or jump too much. The story in this one is more inventive, I feel, and somewhat more passive. You won't laugh your head off (because no one does, it's just the morbidity of the game) with this or the other Postal games. Think of it as a bit like ""Postal Brain Damage,"" and don't think of it as a weird experience. (Besides, what do you want if it's a game from 2011?)

Видно что над игрой работали люди которые, хотели сделать по настоящему веселый продукт, но из-за кризиса и конфронтация с RWS игру сдали в релиз совсем не готовой, это видно по из ниоткуда взявшихся персонажей как ""Дядя Дейв"" да и в целом если посмотреть ролики первых показов, у того же пылесоса было куда больше функций, в игре было в разы больше анимаций и тд,
Честно эта игра будто портал в 2011 год, где обзоры делал Мэддисон, и что-то в этой игре все же есть, думаю это подростковый дух, так как она так же глупа, нелепа и сделана на  отвали где в начале старались, а под конец пошли дедлайны и доделывали как могли.

The hatred is likely due to the terrible optimization, word of mouth from people who haven't played it, and the overall lack of humor.
It's clear that the people working on this game wanted to make a truly fun product, but due to the crisis and confrontation with RWS, the game was released completely unfinished. This is evident in the out-of-nowhere characters like ""Uncle Dave,"" and in general, if you watch the videos of the first reveals, the vacuum cleaner had far more features, the game had many more animations, etc.
Honestly, this game is like a portal to 2011, where Maddison was reviewing it. There's something about this game that I think is a teenage spirit, as it's just as stupid, ridiculous, and haphazardly made, where they tried their best at the beginning, but by the end, deadlines came and they finished it as best they could. I'll give the game a 4, and yes, I got the platinum in it.
P.S. The Dude's design is the best of all the games, and Part 4 is still worse than Part 3, even though they worked on it and had carte blanche in terms of deadlines.
And for 40 rubles, I think it's worth buying, since patches were recently released for it after 13 years."

- Мелкие баги с нпс

- Насладиться можно тоже, последние пару часов меня затянуло на ура

I'll start with the downsides:
- Sound lag, which was very annoying for the first few hours
- The shooting is an acquired taste, but I definitely didn't like it
- If you press Win, just say ""gone""
- Once, after a cutscene, the game froze completely, as did the PC in general, which was unpleasant
- Minor bugs with NPCs

The positives:
- Once you've got it down, it's a good time. You can have fun with it
- You can also enjoy it; I was thoroughly hooked for the last couple of hours

Overall, although there were some unpleasant moments, the emotions were mostly positive."

157357235,english,2024.01.01 23:59,✅,✅,0.5,1,"POSTAL 3 is definitely the black sheep of the series. After my playthrough I can say that the game is a mixed bag full of cool but poorly executed ideas. Compared to POSTAL 2, the game is now third person shooter and uses a regenerative health and cover system, this game goes for a more linear approach to its game play, with some open world type missions sprinkled here and there (You don't get to have full on free roaming until you have done a playthrough). I don't mind the more linear approach but found the levels on offer to be kinda boring and filled with dumb enemy AI to fight.

The game has a morality system, which in theory seems like a cool idea as it allows the player to go down either two paths (Good or Bad) which offer different takes on the story and different levels to play. The only problem is if your playing on the good path for example, and you say accidentally kill a civilian in cross fire your morality meter will go down, the issue is even though the game says you can refill your morality by performing good acts, like doing non lethal take-downs on enemies, It just doesn't refill I found for some reason (I don't know what I was doing wrong?) causing you needing to reload a save if your meter gets too bad if your going for the Good ending.

The morality system also kinda ruins what makes POSTAL so good to begin with, as it restricts a player from fully playing around with the games mechanics and arsenal as if your going for a good ending, your going to need to play more carefully and stop yourself from doing anything that might cause you to lose morality, which for me takes away a lot of the freedom that POSTAL 2 gave you with its gameplay.

The story and humour of this game is on point with the series, It is everything that you come to expect from a POSTAL game and is not for those who can't take a joke and get offended easily. Corey Cruise does an amazing job filling in for the voice of the POSTAL Dude and has a great take on the character and is in my opinion on par with Rick Hunter's performance as the Dude.  

Since this game has been getting new updates and fixes recently, I have only experienced a few crashes here and there, and for some reason a lot of the main game achievements didn't unlock for me.

It took me 4 hours to get through on the Good path and there is replayability to go through the game on the Bad path which offers different missions, story and ending. There is also a free roam mode that unlocks when you finish the game, which allows you to explore the town of Catharsis and lets you loose and experiment with the games mechanics without the restriction of the morality system.    

Conclusion:
Despite my issues with the game, I found it to be an enjoyable mess with some cool ideas that were just not cooked fully. Personally I don't think the game is as bad as everyone says it is (though I did get it for cheap). I recommend to get it on sale for those who enjoy the POSTAL series and don't mind putting up with some jank and some questionable design choices.

Y es que no entiendo cómo un juego desarrollado con Source engine puede ir tan mal, el Gameplay es torpe, los movimientos de postal guy son errados, robóticos y culeros, las armas están muy mal trabajadas y son incómodas de usar, y ni hablemos de los puñetazos, que parece que de 20 golpes que lances contra un peatón, a lo mucho 1 o 2 le van a llegar, como si su hitbox fuera un pequeño rectángulo dentro del modelo 3d, el daño de las armas lo mismo, los npc parecen esponjas de balas, tienes que disparar casi todo tu cargador de pistola para matarlos...

Yo quiero mucho a Postal, pero este definitivamente no da la talla, y es entendible considerando que Running With Scissors no estuvo al 100% involucrado en su desarrollo.

Le doy su respectivo 4/10, es que no sirve ni para sacar risas con su humor jodido de preescolar","It was a gift from a close friend. I put it on my wishlist to buy it when it was on sale and try not to get carried away by the negative reviews I often see about this game. Yes, I'm a huge fan of the Postal saga. I played a bit of the first game, and the second game seemed like the pinnacle of the franchise. I said to myself, ""If Postal 2 was excellent in every aspect, Postal 3 must be at least as good.""

And I just don't understand how a game developed with the Source Engine can be so bad. The gameplay is clumsy, Postal Guy's movements are awkward, robotic, and crap, the weapons are poorly crafted and awkward to use, and let's not even talk about the punches. It seems like out of 20 hits you throw at a pedestrian, at most 1 or 2 will hit them, as if their hitbox were a small rectangle within the 3D model. The weapon damage is the same. The NPCs look like bullet sponges, you have to shoot almost your entire pistol clip to kill them...

I love Postal, but this one definitely doesn't measure up, and it's understandable considering Running With Scissors wasn't 100% involved in its development.

I give it its respective 4/10; it's not even good enough to get laughs with its messed-up preschool humor."

Игру сделали на движке Source, поэтому как минимум стрельба, рэгдоллы и всё, что связано с физикой - приятное. К сожалению убрали открытый мир и сюжет теперь подаётся просто отдельными короткими миссиями. Без открытого мира все жители на этих миссиях просто ходят туда-сюда и уже не чувствуется что мир живёт, а ты в нём находишься и влияешь на что-то. Насилие стало бессмысленным и безнаказанным, жители почти не обращают внимание на главного героя, нет выбора сложности игры, полиция либо не реагирует ни на что, либо ничего не может сделать. Юмор упростился или почти что исчез, всё происходящее на миссиях - абсурдная катавасия. Также из-за диких перестрелок игра печально притормаживает с просадками фпс. Зато понравились красивые локации, прикольное оружие и музыка. Очень понравился внешний вид главного героя и его крутой кожаный плащ. Также неплохо было наблюдать за всем происходящим от третьего лица - все анимации и движения выглядят хорошо.","It's not the best evolution of the series, but I did like some things. The game is built on the Source engine, so at least the shooting, ragdolls, and everything related to physics are enjoyable. Unfortunately, the open world was removed, and the story is now simply told through short, individual missions. Without an open world, all the inhabitants simply wander back and forth during these missions, and it no longer feels like a living world, or like you're in it and influencing anything. Violence has become senseless and unpunished, the inhabitants barely pay attention to the main character, there's no difficulty setting, and the police either don't respond to anything or can't do anything. The humor has been simplified or almost completely disappeared, and everything that happens during missions is an absurd mess. Also, due to the wild gunfights, the game slows down sadly, with frame rates dropping. However, I did like the beautiful locations, cool weapons, and music. I really liked the main character's appearance and his cool leather coat. It was also nice to see everything happening from a third-person perspective - all the animations and movements look good."

Hamur için;
-1.5 bardak süt
-1 bardak ılık su
-2 kaşık sıvı yağ
-1 silme kaşık tuz
-1 paket kabartma tozu
-5-5. 5 bardak un

İç harç için;
-½ kg orta yağlı kıyma
-2 tane kuru soğan
-3 tane yeşil biber
-1 tane domates
-5 6 dal maydanoz
-1 kaşık domates salçası
-1 kaşık acı biber salçası
-2 kaşık sıvı yağ
-Tuz




Tavada lahmacun yapılışı

Öncelikle hamuru hazırlamak için derin bir kabın içine sütü koyun. Üzerine sıvı yağ tuz ekleyin ve yavaş yavaş unu katın. Daha sonra kıvam bulana kadar yavaşça suyu ekleyin. Ele yapışmaz bir kıvam alana kadar yoğurun.

Daha sonra tezgahı unlayın ve bütün hamuru küçük parçalara yırın. Daha sonra dinlenmesi için üzerine bir bez örtün ve bekletin.

Bu arada harç için kıymayı derin bir kaseye alın. Rondoya soğanı yeşil biberi koyun ve ince bir hal alana kadar çekin. Bunu kıymanın içine ilave edin.

Daha sonra domates ve maydanozu da aynı şekilde çekin ve onu da kıymaya ilave edin. Salçasını, tuzunu, sıvı yağ da katıp karıştırın.

Pişirme aşamasında kapaklı yanmaz bir tava kullanabilirsiniz. Tavayı ocağa alın ve ilk hamur parçasını tabak büyüklüğünde açın.

Üzerine aralıklı bir şekilde elinizle iç harcı yayın. Bunu ısınmış olan tavaya yerleştirin. Ocağı önce yüksek ateşte daha sonra kısık ateşte tutun. Kapağı kapatmadan önce üzerine ıslak bir bez kapatın. Altı kızarınca alabilirsiniz. Diğer tüm parçalara aynı işlemi yapın.

Humor. While nowhere near as funny as Postal 2, the game did make me smile a few times. It has a 2000’s decade sense of humor, and was made for people who enjoy video games. Not for the Twitch “gamer gurls” and 300 pound pink haired land whales on Twitter that now LARP as gamers. I also enjoy the dated references, such as having a Sarah Palin and Cesar Millian the Dog Whisperer knock offs in the game.

[h3]CONS[/h3]

Feels like if MDickie made a shooter, hit boxes are way off, the game lags at times, and some missions are unbeatable.

[h3]OVERALL THOUGHTS[/h3]

So I finally played the infamous Postal III, and yes it is really that bad, and no I do not recommend it. That being said, I did enjoy messing around with it, and feel like it was worth the 99 cent sale price I paid for it. As I understand, Postal III was outsourced to a Russian company that was going under and firing developers as it was being made, so because of that it feels more like an unfinished beta version than an actual game. If you are familiar with MDickie games, it feels a lot like if MDickie were to make a shooter. It’s just sad because Postal 2 is one of the funniest and most comfiest video games I’ve ever played, and Postal III is just a mess. If you’re a diehard Postal 2 fan then 99 cents is a fair price, just understand that this is a broken game, and you’ll probably want to install a few mods. I’ll list some mods down below.

[h3]QUALITY OF LIFE FIXES & MODS[/h3]

[b]CONTROLLER:[/b] Go into the config file and change “joystick=0” to “joystick=1” this will make your controller instantly work, with the exception of selecting weapons, that part is a bit touch and go, and you’ll probably still need to use your mouse wheel for that.

[b]VCAM:[/b] Improved third person camera, and gives the option for first person camera.

[b]NO SPLASH SCREENS:[/b] Eliminates a couple of the 40 splash screens at the start of the game.

[b]OMEGA PUNCH:[/b] Gives you a one hit kill, with how bad the hit boxes are, it makes the game a bit more fair.

Если вы как и я хотите быстро получить все достижения в сей игре, то 1. Ищите в ютубе ""Как легко получить тяжёлые достижения в Postal 3"" и смотрите видео; 2.

The story honestly didn't work for me. But the most annoying thing for me here are the achievements. It's complete bullshit. How could they code that a terrorist is a rhinoceros, a grandpa or grandma is someone in a fight on the 2nd patrol, and how can you finish the game using only a pistol or melee weapon?
P.S.
If you, like me, want to quickly get all the achievements in this game, then 1. Search YouTube for ""How to easily get hard achievements in Postal 3"" and watch the video; 2. Download either ArtMoney or CheatEngine, they are needed to get achievements based on quantity (if you want to get them quickly, of course, I think it’s not hard to figure out how to use these applications to get achievements), 3.

The levels are short and repetitive, a mess of endlessly spawning characters around the hero.

Dura pochissimo (non l'ho nemmeno completato poiché mi ha annoiato dopo pochissimo per via della sua macchinosità e lentezza), e per quel poco che dura non vale quello che costa.

This new third-person style, unlike the previous game, doesn't really fit the game at all. It's cumbersome, full of bugs, crashes, and the sound is annoying because you're constantly bombarded with music throughout the game. There's nothing positive about it, absolutely nothing. It lasts very little (I didn't even finish it because it bored me after a short while due to its slowness and complexity), and for the short time it lasts, it's not worth the price.

Did you find it on sale for 1 euro like I did? Well, it's not even worth that euro, trust me.

En realidad solo se lo recomendaría a los fans de postal aunque creo que solo lo jugarán porque lo volvieron a poner en steam después de mucho tiempo fuera del mercado XD.

Es tal cual como dicen, super duper repetitivo y muy bugeado (tenes que hacer las misiones tal cual son, si queres explorar o experimentar entonces vas a quedar bugeado) hasta las animaciones son basura.

Hay algo nuevo que pusieron y es que depende de como te comportes en las misiones (haciendolo como buena o mala persona) entonces te pueden dan la oportunidad de ser policía (en donde también tenés misiones y si lo haces mal entonces te despiden del trabajo volviendo como un civil).

Lo bueno es que es un juego barato, así que por eso solo se lo recomendaría a gente que quiere jugar toda la saga, JAMAS se lo recomendaría a alguien nuevo XD.
Me gustaría igual que mejor le hagan un remake, se que con este juego los devs tuvieron muchos problemas y por eso es tan malo, pero se que no lo harán ya que este juego es el verdadero meme de la saga.","I'm giving it a 4/10, being generous.
Actually, I would only recommend it to Postcard fans, although I think they'll only play it because they put it back on Steam after a long time off the market XD.

It's just like they say, super duper repetitive and very buggy (you have to do the missions exactly as they are; if you want to explore or experiment, then you'll be bugged). Even the animations are garbage.

There's something new they added, and depending on how you behave in the missions (doing it as a good or bad person), they can give you the opportunity to be a police officer (where you also have missions, and if you do poorly, then you get fired from your job and return as a civilian).

The good thing is that it's a cheap game, so that's why I would only recommend it to people who want to play the entire series. I would NEVER recommend it to someone new XD.
I would also like them to do a remake. I know the developers had a lot of problems with this game and that's why it's so bad, but I know they won't do it since this game is the true meme of the series."

скучные, тупые, однотипные задачи
крайняя неуютность и сконфуженность. У игроков, прошедших п2, нет времени привыкнуть к новому движку, новому управлению, новым шорткатам, новым механикам, ведь когда ты только запускаешь миссию, ТЕБЯ СРАЗУ АТАКУЮТ ДЕСЯТКИ  БЕСКОНЕЧНО СПАВНИЩИХСЯ ВРАГОВ, КОТОРЫЕ ВЫНОСЯТ ТЕБЯ ЗА ОДИН УДАР, А ТЫ ОДНОГО ЧЕЛА ЗА ПОЛОВИНУ БОЕПРИПАСА ПУЛЕМЕТА))))
из-за прошлой проблемы выходит то, что либо ты проходишь одинаково сложные миссии либо 30 раз, либо сразу за минуту и ты ничего не понимаешь.
что касается ру локализации, то идея сделать не дубляж, а просто озвучку ПОВЕРХ ориг дорожки была супермегаТУПОЙ, ведь в катсценах Кори Круз, массовка и кураж бомбей сливаются в непонимаемое нечто, где ты просто не различаешь половину слов.

ну и канеш субъективщина, вроде ""это не тру постал, а уже полная похабщина какая-то"" и тупого дизайна п3 чувака

[h2]в общем, вердикт[/h2]

играть строго на свое усмотрение. главное, знать, на что идешь, и не [i]жалеть[/i] о потраченных на данный непонятный продукт 40 рублей (для тех, кто купил по фулл прайсу, предлагаю создать отдельную ачивку ""богатый мазохист"")

Keep in mind that THIS is only playable by true fans, because only we can tolerate such abuse.

Cool hand-drawn cutscene at the beginning, and all the illustrations in general
MEGA-COOL-AWESOME MAIN MENU, THIS DUDE IS SO GOOD, YEAHHHH
Cool soundtrack

[h2]-[/h2]
The soundtrack gets boring after 0.209038k42 milliseconds
Boring, dumb, repetitive tasks
Extremely uncomfortable and awkward. Players who completed P2 don't have time to get used to the new engine, new controls, new shortcuts, new mechanics. Because when you first start a mission, YOU'RE IMMEDIATELY ATTACKED BY DOZENS OF ENDLESSLY SPAWNING ENEMIES WHO KILL YOU IN ONE HIT, AND YOU KILL ONE GUY WITH HALF A MACHINE GUN AMMO.

Because of the previous problem, you either play through equally difficult missions 30 times, or all in a minute, and you don't understand a thing.

As for Russian localization, the idea of ​​doing not a dub, but simply adding voiceover ON TOP of the original soundtrack was super-mega-STUPID, because in the cutscenes, Cory Cruz, the extras, and the Bombay swagger merge into something incomprehensible, where you simply can't distinguish half the words.

And of course, there's subjectivity, like ""this isn't a true post, it's complete and utter trash"" and the dude's stupid P3 design.

[h2]so, the verdict[/h2]

Play strictly at your own discretion. The main thing is to know what you're getting into and not [i]regret[/i] the 40 rubles you spent on this obscure product (for those who bought it at the full price, I suggest creating a separate ""rich masochist"" achievement).

Although, what [i]regret[/i] can you talk about sleeping in the fanbase?
After all, we
[b][i]regret nothing[/i][/b]

[h1]UPDATE[/h1]
[spoiler]I've been playing this for 11 hours straight without a break. I'm crazy. This is the best game in the world. You don't understand anything.
Okay, the mission where you have to rig animals in a lab is really cool.
Everything else is boring and crazy.

С данной игрой я ознакомился еще с ее релиза! В свое время, я хорошенько наигрался во вторую часть, и для меня было счастье узнать, что у игры появилась продолжение, и поиграв в нее, она оставила после себя хорошие ощущение! Но тогда я не знал, что у игры были весьма плохие отзывы, и не думал, что играет не настолько хороша, как считал мой на тот момент детский мозг.. Но все по порядку:

Сюжет: После сюжета второй части, мы попадаем в другой городок, где Чувак пытается найти немного денег, но каждый раз оказывается не с чем. Но один момент может полностью изменить его жизнь, где ему дается выбор, за какую сторону ему выбрать!

Геймплей: Он остался таким же, только теперь камера от третьего лица! Разнообразие оружие теперь увеличился. Появился новые оружие, из которой, я могу выделить лишь барсука (На самом деле, я бы не сказал, что есть настолько много разнообразии оружие, я просто немного забыл)! В игре появился выбор, где будет решаться судьба Чувака, и дальнейшая конца. Больше нечего нового нету.... 

Музыка: Я тупой, поэтому пропущу!

Итог: У игры был хороший потенциал, но разрабы все просрали! Озвучка изменилась, и теперь по больше части, будет только говорить один и тот же голос (Помоему...), причем русская озвучка идет вместе с английской, и не всегда понятно, что он вообще сказал! У игры ужасный оптимизация, и может пробить нормальный сборки! Из-за провала данной части, из-за чего разрабы просто решили сделать так, что сюжет данной части не существует, поскольку появилась длс для второй части! Я же не могу сказать, что игра хорошая, но для себя не могу сказать, что игра плохая, ибо тут уже идет детская память и теплые воспоминание не дают это сделать... Да я понимаю все недочеты данной части, и согласен с негативными отзывами! Но я все еще буду любить ее, поскольку я говноед!!!

7 Спасибо русским разрабам хоть не хорошую игру, но классное детское прохождение из 10!

Да, если кто то не знал, эту часть сделали русские разрабы! Лично я узнал только щас...","This game isn't the best in the series, but it still has its charm!

I've been playing this game since its release! I thoroughly enjoyed the second game, and I was happy to learn there was a sequel, and after playing it, it left a good impression! But back then, I didn't know the game had received some pretty bad reviews, and I didn't realize it wasn't as good as my childish mind thought at the time. But first things first:

Plot: Following the plot of the second game, we find ourselves in another town where the Dude is trying to find some money, but always ends up with nothing. But one moment could completely change his life, where he's given a choice: which side to side with!

Gameplay: It's the same, only now the camera is third-person! The variety of weapons has increased. New weapons have appeared, of which the only one I can highlight is the badger (Actually, I wouldn't say there's that much variety; I just forgot a bit)! The game now features a choice that will decide the Dude's fate and the rest of the game. Nothing else new...

Music: I'm dumb, so I'll skip it!

Result: The game had great potential, but the developers screwed it up! The voice acting has changed, and now, for the most part, it's just the same voice (I think...), and the Russian voiceover is mixed with the English, so it's not always clear what he's saying! The game has terrible optimization, and a normal build can be broken! Because of the failure of this part, the developers simply decided to make it so the plot of this part doesn't exist, since DLC for the second part was released! I can't say the game is good, but I can't say it's bad for myself, because my childhood memories are already kicking in, and fond memories prevent me from doing so... Yes, I understand all the shortcomings of this installment, and I agree with the negative reviews! But I'll still love it, because I'm a shit eater!!!

7 Thanks to the Russian developers, although it's not a good game, it's a great children's playthrough out of 10!

Yes, in case anyone didn't know, this installment was made by Russian developers! Personally, I only just found out..."

I wanted to try it out to see if it really deserved all the hate, and I had a pretty bad time with the constant crashing and lag, plus the awkward mechanics and controls. I don't know if it's playable on console, but as far as the PC port goes, it isn't. The best thing you can do is buy Lost Paradise, since it's a direct sequel to the second game, and the entire story of this game is a dream (meaning it's not canon)."

Игра 2003 года, она не идеальна, множество багов, кривые модели NPC и много чего еще присутствовало в ней, но она была прекрасна. Поиграв час в эту часть у меня было лишь отвращение к ней, так как все фразы из второй части были другими... Их полностью перефразировали, и самое смешное, что озвучка стала однаголосой. 
Испорчен сам концепт игры. Отвратительное управление, вид от 3-его лица, хотя смысл? Присутствие фоновых шумов-помех.
Вытерпеть эту часть я смог только до ТЦ, где нужно отбиваться от ""фанатиков"" - полицейских. Бесконечные орды, которые спавнятся прямо на глазах ждут тебя. В задании, где нужно защищать бабу, которая раздавала автографы, если начать убивать ""мамаш"", то нужно будет отбиваться от полицейских тоже. Бегая за мамашами, начинаем убивать и полицейских, нужно убить 15 ""мамаш"", но в этот момент будут мешать полицейские, которых ты тоже должен будешь убить, но то количество, которое будет убито не засчитается, так как первым нужно было убить ""мамаш""...
Ломаный код игры, бесконечные орды, кривые фразы чувака. Это все меня сильно выбесело! Никому не советую покупать эту часть Postal, даже если за копейки. Лучше берите вторую часть, она прекрасна","I recently finished my favorite childhood game, Postal 2. It's a 2003 game, not perfect—lots of bugs, crooked NPC models, and a lot of other stuff—but it was great. After playing this part for an hour, I was nothing but disgusted, as all the lines from the second game were different... They were completely rephrased, and the funniest thing is, the voice acting is now monochromatic.
The very concept of the game is ruined. Terrible controls, third-person view—what's the point? The background noise and static.
I could only endure this part up until the shopping mall, where you have to fight off ""fanatical"" police officers. Endless hordes of them spawn right before your eyes. In the mission where you have to protect the woman who was signing autographs, if you start killing the ""mothers,"" you'll have to fight off the police too. While chasing the ""Moms,"" we start killing cops. You need to kill 15 ""Moms,"" but at that point, cops will get in the way, and you'll have to kill them too, but the number you kill won't count, since you should have killed the ""Moms"" first...
The game's broken code, the endless hordes, the guy's awkward phrasing. It all really pissed me off! I don't recommend anyone buy this part of Postal, even if it's cheap. Better get the second one, it's amazing."

Открытого мира в игре - нет. Есть режим свободной прогулки, открывающийся после прохождения, и тот - с загрузками.

У гамамёта бесконечный боезапас, и он чуть ли не мгновенно усыпляет врагов, а для средних дистанций - подойдет тазер. А, кстати - вы НЕ разберётесь, как он работает на миссии с Джен, ведь вам нужно ДЕРЖАТЬ клавишу основной атаки, а не нажимать её. Где вы это найдёте? В руководстве! Никто же его не прочитает!

The game has a karma system, which doesn't work as advertised. I liked the idea, but the wonderful Improvement Mod removes it completely. This is more of a mod issue, but still.
[h2]Catharsis![/h2]
The game doesn't have an open world. There's a free-roam mode that unlocks after completing the game, and it requires loading screens. There are no NPCs here, the missions are repetitive and monotonous, and the only weapons you'll use are the Hammer Gun [spoiler]or the Badger, which is in the game[/spoiler]—which isn't even in the game, it's added via a mod! The Hammer Gun has infinite ammo and puts enemies to sleep almost instantly, and for medium range, the Taser is perfect. Oh, and you won't figure out how it works in the mission with Jen, because you have to HOLD the primary attack key, not press it. Where will you find that? In the manual! No one will read it! The game shows you a cutscene saying you can regenerate good karma. That's not true! How do you know that? That's right, [spoiler]from Hitler![/spoiler] from the manual!

При этом это было мое второе прохождение этого паскудного куска кода который еще за чем-то акелловцы решили перевыложить в стиме без старфорса.

Ну если смотреть без рофлов и прочего то игра канешь достаточно помойная вприципе какой и была такой и осталось патч с которым был вырезан стар форс общал чутка улучший производительность но фпс не поднимающийся выше 130 и все еще просаживаюшися ниже 50 сильно краше картину не делает.
=
Че там по графону ну вроде нормальный, на мой вкус куда приятнее четверки с ее интенсивными пост шейдерами и излишне вылизанными моделями которые выглядят каким-то образом хуже чем здешние хотя и тут не все идеально.
=
Гейплей ну с ним ничего особо сказать просто не о чем. Система кармы просто мусор ее можно терять но не получать хз вообще как мне удалось за полицая пройти на втором прохождении. Причем путь ""геройский"" наиболее скучный и если соберетесь играть то забейте оно того не стоит. И чуть более разнообразный плохой путь где можно не парится по тому что бот опять прыгнул тебе под пули.  

Пушки в своей основе довольно косые кроме пистолета с штурмовой винтовкой все остальное не особо юзабельно. Например у дробивика смешной урон словно стреляешь во врогов солью, пулемет настолько косой что ближе 3-4 метров попасть уже удача даже если стрелять прицельно, ракетамет сильный но безполезный тк нашел я его ток под конец игры и на нажатии лкм подрываешься тк ее нужно зажимать как во второй части хотя толку в этом на пкм ракета сразу летит по прямой и все норм. ближний бой бесполезен совершенно тк хитбоксы явно кривые и приходится совсем в упор к ботам лезть ради того чтоб полоснуть противника. Остальной мусор по типу кошек, пылесоса, баллончиков и тд безполезный и по приколу можно по юзать но на практике не особо юзабельны.

Че еще написать ээээ....
Сюжет написан наркоманом который явно не мог определится для кого пилит игру для америкосов или русни Тк приколов которые не поймут обе стороны достаточно, да и те что поймут не то чтобы смешные были особо.

Озвучка одноголосая хлам как и фразы чувака не в попад.

Музыку тут принято хвалить, но не сказать чтоб она супер хорошей просто нормальная.

Обобщая можно сказать что игра мусор хотя у нее был потенциал стать лучшей в серии но разрабы по ощущению толи на пол пути забили толи денег и времени им не до дали. Смотрел там вроде моды есть которые кучу всего фиксят но я проходил без них тк эту игру лучше сделает только слитые исходники и пачка неадекватов которые на основе этого сделают нормальную игру. 

3.5 / 10 -  в коллекцию фаната постала взять можно или если хочется поиграть в плохо сделанную игру чтоб другие недоделанные продукты казались лучше чем они есть на самом деле тоже можно хотя некоторые из них эта игра и переплюнуть может что канешь прискорбно.","Worse than the second game, but somehow better than the fourth, which I didn't have the nerve to complete.

And that was my second playthrough of this vile piece of code, which, for some reason, the Akello team decided to re-upload to Steam without Star Force.

Well, if you look at it without any jokes or anything, the game is, of course, pretty trash, basically what it was and remains. The patch that removed Star Force reportedly improved performance slightly, but the FPS, which never goes above 130 and still drops below 50, doesn't make the picture much better.
=
As for the graphics, well, it's okay; in my opinion, it's much nicer than the fourth game with its intensive post-shaders and overly polished models, which somehow look worse than the ones here, although not everything is perfect there.
=
Gameplay, well, there's nothing much to say about it. The karma system is rubbish—you can lose it but not get it. I don't know how I managed to complete the second playthrough as a cop. The ""heroic"" path is the most boring, and if you're planning on playing, forget it—it's not worth it. And there's a slightly more varied bad path where you don't have to worry about a bot jumping in front of you again.

The guns are fundamentally pretty sloppy, except for the pistol and assault rifle. Everything else isn't particularly usable. For example, the shotgun's damage is ridiculous, like shooting enemies with salt. The machine gun is so sloppy that hitting closer than 3-4 meters is a stroke of luck, even with aim. The rocket launcher is powerful but useless, as I only found it towards the end of the game. You explode when you press the left mouse button, as you have to hold it down like in the second game, although that's pointless—the right mouse button launches the rocket straight ahead and everything's fine. Melee combat is completely useless because the hitboxes are clearly broken, and you have to get right up close to the bots to slash an enemy. Other junk like cats, vacuum cleaners, spray cans, and so on are useless and can be used for fun, but they're not particularly usable in practice.

What else is there to write?
The plot was written by a drug addict who clearly couldn't decide whether he was making a game for Americans or Russians. There are plenty of jokes that both sides won't understand, and even those that do aren't particularly funny.

The voice acting is monotonous and trash, as are the guy's lines.

The music is generally praised, but it's not super good—it's just okay.

To summarize, the game is garbage, although it had the potential to be the best in the series, but it feels like the developers either gave up halfway through or didn't give them the time or money. I saw there were mods that fixed a bunch of things, but I played through them without them, because the only thing that could make this game better would be leaked source code and a bunch of idiots who would make a decent game out of it.

3.5/10 - It's worth adding to a fan's collection, or if you want to play a poorly made game to make other half-baked products seem better than they actually are, you can do that too, although this game can probably surpass some of them, which is unfortunate."

Из всех багов мне попалось лишь 2: Шлемосос не хотел идти за мной в бункер и у меня вылетала игра при убийстве талибов на миссии ""Родина в опасности!"". Пришлось скипать. Тех самых критических вылетов с живым щитом и гранатами у меня не случились, либо кто-то пустил про это байку, либо же я такой везучий.
Выглядит игра красиво, в глаза бросаются лишь эти мультяшные НПС, Чувак сделан неплохо. Что ещё бросается в глаза, так это блудмарки (кровь на модельках нпс) которые выглядят криво на модельках, и звуки из Half-Life 2, из-за которых что там, что тут уши корёжит.
ИИ да, туповат, когда я выполнял задание в Гетто, то ко мне подошёл случайный НПС, и начал бить Чувака (если бы я его убил, то я бы потерял Карму), но потом меня защитил коп. Но всё же, ИИ хоть и четно, но выполняет свои основные задачи.
Из всего огнестрела топит лишь М16, Дробовик, и М249, пистолет наносит практически столько же урона сколько и пистолет из Postal 2, тоже стреляет медленно и наносит маленько урона.
Из холодного оружия топит лишь мачете, ибо ей легче попасть по НПС, нежели кувалдой и топором, у которых ещё и анимация затянутая. Котов можно набрать лишь в свободном мире и в миссии с поимкой котов. Я их никогда не использовал, потому что они не хотят цепляться за НПС, да и они бесполезны в целом.
Из остального оружия - всё сосёт. Канистрой сложно кого либо облить, и бензин не всегда хочет поджигаться. Шокер - он только для двух миссий. Перцовый баллончик не всегда хочет поджигать нпс. Чувак ссыт быстро, и моча долго восстанавливается, от чего лучше держаться от огня подальше. Пылесос только для одной миссии, в остальном он бесполезен.
Те кто жаловались на озвучку, ну бл*ть, игра так-то пародирует старые боевики с одноголосной озвучкой как у Гаврилова или Володарского (земля ему пухом).
Локации красивые, но ещё большую красоту вырезали из-за того что Движок уже просто выдыхался, тот же водопад на базе Экологов в пример.
Что интересно, так это то, что игру можно запустить на Xbox 360. Не хило, да?
Также можно запустить карты с игр которые были сделаны на Source (по этой теме есть даже руководство).
Подводим итоги. Мне было весело проходить это, и играть. Как по мне, игру засрали из-за ожиданий игроков. Люди хотели такой же трешачок как и во второй части, хотели разделение на дни, и они жаловались на линейное повествование (хотя в Apocalypse Weekend также было, и никто не жаловался). Да, игра сделана на багах и на индийском кладбище из имён разработчиков которых после выхода игры выгнали на мороз, но мне игра очень зашла, и советую вам ознакомиться с нею.","Well, I bought Postal III on Steam... And what can I say? It's just a normal game.
Of all the bugs, I only encountered two: Helmet Sucker wouldn't follow me into the bunker, and the game crashed when killing Taliban in the mission ""Homeland in Danger!"" I had to skip. I didn't experience those critical crashes with a human shield and grenades; either someone started a story about that, or I'm just that lucky.
The game looks beautiful; the only thing that catches my eye are those cartoonish NPCs. Dude is well-made. What's also noticeable are the blood marks (blood on the NPC models), which look crooked on the models, and the sounds from Half-Life 2, which are ear-wrenching everywhere. The AI ​​is a bit slow, yes. When I was doing a mission in the Ghetto, a random NPC approached me and started hitting the Dude (if I'd killed him, I would have lost Karma), but then a cop protected me. Still, the AI, while fair, does its main job.
Of all the firearms, the only ones that work are the M16, Shotgun, and M249. The pistol deals almost as much damage as the pistol from Postal 2, but it also fires slowly and deals little damage.
Of the melee weapons, the only one that works is the machete, as it's easier to hit NPCs with it than the sledgehammer and axe, which also have a slow animation. Cats can only be found in the wild and in the cat-catching mission. I never used them because they don't want to latch onto NPCs, and they're generally useless.
Of the other weapons, everything sucks. It's hard to douse someone with a canister, and gasoline doesn't always ignite. The stun gun is only good for two missions. Pepper spray doesn't always set NPCs on fire. The guy pees quickly, and his urine regenerates slowly, so it's best to stay away from fire. The vacuum cleaner is only good for one mission; it's useless otherwise.
Those who complained about the voice acting—well, damn, the game actually parodies old action movies with monotonous voice acting like Gavrilov or Voldarsky (may he rest in peace).
The locations are beautiful, but even more beautiful ones were cut because the engine was simply running out of steam. Take the waterfall at the Ecologists' base, for example.
What's interesting is that the game can be run on Xbox 360. Not bad, huh?
You can also run maps from games made with Source (there's even a guide on this topic).
So, to sum it up. I had a lot of fun playing it and playing it. In my opinion, the game was ruined because of player expectations. People wanted the same trash as the second game, wanted a day-by-day progression, and they complained about the linear narrative (though Apocalypse Weekend had the same thing, and no one complained). Yes, the game is built on bugs and an Indian cemetery of developers who were kicked out into the cold after the game's release, but I really enjoyed it, and I recommend you check it out."

152715834,russian,2023.11.02 15:46,❌,✅,0.5600000024,4,"[h1] На сколько была хороша вторая часть Postal из-за своего абсурда, безумия и треша, на столько же и плоха третья. [/h1]

Сразу проясним момент. Игру делала другая команда. Да и сама игра была в производственном аду. Меняла команды, издателей, концепт, движки. просто учтем и запомним.
Но главное мое разочарование в игре - совершенное не понимание новых авторов сия творения идеи второй Postal. Абсурд, безумие и треш должны иметь предел. Нет, не предел допустимого, а баланс между перебором и недобором. Когда абсурда становиться слишком много появляется каша, просто смесь всего. А когда слишком мало, то абсурд становится легкой, неумелой и не уместной шуткой. Например, условно тема политики и секса. Абсурд доводит эти темы до пика, выделяя более контрастирующие элементы. Они в свою очередь вызывают абсурдность ситуации. Вторая часть очень умело могла как в псевдополитику, так и показать разврат масс, о котором в обществе не принято говорить. Но Postal 3 в теме политики не дотягивает (Не удивительно почему, к 2011 появились некие правила к контролю цензуры в видеоиграх), а с темой секса перебарщивает, словно перевозбужденная двеннадцатилетка, смотрящая круглыми сутками видео на специализированных сайтах. И так со всеми темами: общество потребления, религия, убийства, бездушный капитализм и т.д.
В том, чем Postal 2 имела баланс и сами темы абсурда куда-то вели, в Postal 3 то перебарщивает, то не может нормально раскрыть темы, которые в свою очередь не к чему не ведут, а просто есть.
Остальные минусы банальны: графон средний даже по меркам 2011, геймплей вызывает боль музыкальное сопровождение лучше бы отсутствовало, диалоги ради диалогов и т.д.

1/10","[h1] As good as the second Postal was for its absurdity, madness, and trash, the third is just as bad. [/h1]

Let's clarify something right away. The game was made by a different team. And the game itself was in production hell. It changed teams, publishers, concepts, and engines. Let's just take that into account and remember.
But my main disappointment with the game is the new creators' complete lack of understanding of the idea behind the second Postal. Absurdity, madness, and trash must have a limit. No, not a limit to what's acceptable, but a balance between too much and too little. When there's too much absurdity, it becomes a mess, a mere jumble of everything. And when there's too little, the absurdity becomes a light, clumsy, and inappropriate joke. For example, consider the themes of politics and sex. The absurdity elevates these themes to a peak, highlighting the more contrasting elements. These elements, in turn, create an absurd situation. The second part was very adept at both pseudo-politics and depicting the depravity of the masses, which is not generally discussed in society. But Postal 3 falls short on the political front (it's no surprise that by 2011, certain regulations had been introduced to control censorship in video games), and it overdoes the sex theme, like an overexcited twelve-year-old watching videos on specialized websites 24/7. This applies to all themes: consumer society, religion, murder, soulless capitalism, and so on.
Whereas Postal 2 had balance and the absurd themes themselves led somewhere, Postal 3 sometimes overdoes it, sometimes failing to adequately explore the themes, which in turn lead nowhere, but are simply there.
The other downsides are trivial: the graphics are average even by 2011 standards, the gameplay is painful, the musical score would have been better absent, dialogue for the sake of dialogue, etc.

Cutscenes are very annoying combined with starting tutorial as if they really thought cam shots would've been super unique and cool.

Postal III is a very brutal and humorous experience on what it is like in Catharsis, Arizona. This game really shows what it is like to be a cool dude in a bad place.

Pros: The gun-play is AMAZING!!! The game uses familiar locations throughout the game so the company can use more time working on the other parts of the game. The game completely revamps the way you heal by adding a cover healing system. The game runs perfectly well with hardly no crashes whatsoever. The way to access the game before DRM fix was totally not a pain in the ass. The screams at the end of almost every cutscene freak me the heck out every time.

Cons: Everything listed above is totally not the opposite. Not enough Krotchy.


Jokes aside, the game isn't the worst thing in the world, but it is pretty shit. It looks fine and Corey Cruise did a good job.

Postal 1 is a psychotic twin stick shooter with fun to be had. Postal 2 is an open ended choice game with only one sane person in Arizona. Postal 2: Apocalypse Weekend is fun extra content for Postal 2. Postal III is complete and udder dumpster trash with problems not even a therapist can help. Postal 2: Paradise Lost is Postal III but good and not Postal III. Postal Redux is a modern and fresh remake of the first Postal game. Postal 4 is a buggy mess with still some fun to be had. Postal Brain Damaged is fun FPS that stars the Postal Dude and the Postal Dude's brain. POOSTAL ROYALE is a joke. The Postal Movie is a cinematic masterpiece with goofy humor.

Postal III is a buggy mess with the only good part is the voice actor Corey Cruise. If you are a Postal fan, you don't need to play this game. The only way I would recommend this game is for people to get the complete Postal experience. Postal III is a 3/10 in my books.","Postal III is a completely different experience from every game aside from Apocalypse Weekend due to it's linear form.

Desarrollado por un estudio ajeno a los originales, aun que coproducido y ayudado por ellos.
Le quise dar una oportunidad ya que me jugue los 2 anteriores y el 2 en concreto me encanto, recientemente los desarrolladores tuvieron que actualizar el juego y quitarle el DRM ya que valve lo elimino de la tienda por que era injugable.
Aprovechando esto empecé y vaya experienda mas aterradora, es la primera vez que veo un juego en source tan mal optimizado, he tenido zonas que jugaba a 30 fps.
La historia es estupida y no tiene nada de gracia, debo estar haciendome viejo por que me parecia todo humor infantil por que dice pedo caca culo y fuck.
3 horas de triste gameplay, menos mal que me costo 1€ el juego, aun que tiene 2 finales.
Gameplay ortopedico, armas con mucho recoil y poca variedad.
El juego tiene muchisimos bugs y se crashea costantemente, los logros estan rotos no se pueden obtener.
No se, esta todo mal, jamás lo recomendaria.","Sequel to the famous Postal 2, a great game of its time, due to its insanity and the fact that it was partly open-world and had a lot to do.
Developed by a studio unrelated to the originals, although co-produced and assisted by them.
I wanted to give it a try since I played the previous two and loved the second one in particular. The developers recently had to update the game and remove the DRM because Valve removed it from the store because it was unplayable.
Taking advantage of this, I started it and what a terrifying experience it was. It's the first time I've seen a source game so poorly optimized. I've even had areas that I played at 30 fps.
The story is stupid and not funny at all. I must be getting old because it all seemed like juvenile humor because it says fart, poop, ass, and fuck.
3 hours of miserable gameplay. Thank goodness the game cost me €1, even though it has two endings.
Orthopedic gameplay, weapons with a lot of recoil and little variety.
The game has tons of bugs and crashes constantly, the achievements are broken and unobtainable.
I don't know, it's all bad, I would never recommend it."

When you enter the game, you're greeted by a rather beautiful menu, which I personally liked. The game itself features a nice soundtrack that plays throughout the missions, making it pleasant to listen to. I liked the good and bad path mechanics, as they change the missions and endings. The cool thing is, your path can change right during the mission. However, this game has quite a few bugs, stupid AI, and audio issues, but they can be resolved by entering the command snd_rebuildaudiocache in the console. It helped me.

Artılar
+Müzik-Oyunun müzikleri çok iyi A Fall To Break harika işler başarmış
+Yenilikler-Oyunda bir karma sistemi olması ve gidişatımıza göre farklı sonlar olması iyi ilk oyunda pacifist bitirince de aynı son maniac bitirince de aynı son hoş açıkcası
+Silahlar-Gayet tatmin edici zaten o kadar fazlasına gerek de yoktu 
Artıları bitti

Orta 
-+Hikaye-Hem eksi hem artı kimine göre iyi kimine göre kötü benim için ortalamaydı
-+Oynanış-İlk oyunun aksine bu sefer 3.şahıs kameradan oynuyoruz ve bu beni aşırı tilt etti kamerayla boğuştum oyunda 
-+Dude-Dude için yeni ses aktörü açıkcası Dude için iyi bana göre pek de bir sıkıntı yoktu ama Postal 2 deki Dude her zaman konuşmuyor buradaki Dude kafamı sikti adam vuruyorsun konuşuyor silah değiştiriyorsun konuşuyor baydı baya bir
-+Yan Karakterler-Oyunda zaten 5 tane mi ne karakter var bunların da bazıları ilk oyunda vardı Uncle Dave gibi yeni adamlar daha yeni karakter eklemek yerine oyunda Jon diye bir adam var kılık değiştirip farklı işlere giriyor bunun yerine ayrı ayrı karakterler daha iyi olabilirdi

Orta diyebileceğimiz şeyler de bu kadardı

Eksiler
-Optimizasyon-Oyunu 30 fpsden yüksek oynayamadım hele Krotchy maskotunu öldürdüğümüz görevinde 5 FPS falandı 3-4 kere oyunum çöktü optimizasyon çöp
-Başarımlar-Önceki Postal oyununda başarımlar büyük bir rol oynuyordu bu oyunda doğru düzgün çalışmıyor bile mesela All American başarımı için normalde 235 Al Qaeda teröristi vurmanız gerek ama oyunda Meth Crazed Rhino öldürürseniz kendisi bir boss bu arada onun ölümünü sayıyor
-Linear İlerleyen Hikaye-Önceki oyunda göreve siz kocaman haritada yürüyerek giderdiniz ve oyun sizi zorlamazdı ama bu oyunda görevden çıkıyorsunuz başka görev chapter chapter ilerliyor özgürce dolaşma da oyunu bitirince açılıyor aşırı saçma geldi bana

Jasně, je to zabugované až běda, neustále to padá, optimalizace je hrozná, sound design vám bude často rvát uši, ovládání melee zbraní je otřesné a střelné na tom nejsou o moc lépe. Ale jinak... mě to prostě bavilo. Příběh byla nesmyslná volovina, která si ale držela Postalovskou atmosféru a některé momenty, jako setkání s Uwe Bollem, byly vskutku legendární. Cutscény byly skvělé, díky načasování hlášek jsem se párkrát i reálně nahlas zasmál, Corey Cruise byl v roli Duda výborný a soundtrack byl vybrán skvěle. Systém karmy a dvou odlišných dějových linek byl zajímavý a zasloužil by si návrat v nějaké další hře ze série a celkově tam bylo vidět mnoho snahy zmařené krachem Акеллы a neschopností jejich hlavounů. Díky délce hry jsem navíc měl motivaci si projít i druhou, a paradoxně mnohem lepší, variantu příběhu za ""slušného občana"", kterou jsem se navíc rozhodl dohrát bez zabíjení, což mi samozřejmě hra nezapočítala a nedostal jsem achievment, ale to se asi dalo čekat. Ve své době a za plnou cenu si určitě Postal 3 reputaci, kterou nyní na internetu má, zasloužil, ale v dnešní době, a navíc za tak nízkou cenu, musím říct, že... [b] ničeho nelituju [/b].","Think of me what you will. Maybe I'm a bit of a masochist, but I just enjoyed Postal 3. Sure, it's buggy as hell, it crashes all the time, the optimization is terrible, the sound design will often make your ears hurt, the melee weapon controls are terrible and the firearms aren't much better. But otherwise... I just enjoyed it. The story was pointless nonsense, but it kept the Postal atmosphere and some moments, like the meeting with Uwe Boll, were truly legendary. The cutscenes were great, the timing of the lines made me laugh out loud a few times, Corey Cruise was excellent as Dud and the soundtrack was chosen brilliantly. The karma system and two different storylines were interesting and would deserve a return in another game in the series and overall there was a lot of effort wasted by the collapse of Akella and the incompetence of their leaders. Thanks to the length of the game, I was also motivated to play the second, and paradoxically much better, version of the story as a ""decent citizen"", which I decided to complete without killing, which of course the game did not count and I did not get the achievement, but that was probably to be expected. In its time and at full price, Postal 3 certainly deserved the reputation it now has on the internet, but nowadays, and at such a low price, I have to say that... [b] I regret nothing [/b]."

Likely one of the WORST games i've played and it's not worth it for you, the reader, to buy this game under ANY circumstances. I wouldn't even tell the most die-hard Postal fan to buy this or pirate it. This game can be thrown back into the fiery chasm from whence it came. 

If you're still willing to read all of my thoughts on this festering parasite plaguing the Postal franchise, i'll indulge.

Set after the Apocalypse Weekend of Postal 2, the Postal Dude and Champ decide to find somewhere new to call home while the Dude looks for a job. Calling Catharsis their new home, the Dude will find his first job in a sex shop ran by Ron Jeremy. From there the Dude finds no success with other jobs and getting paid before stumbling across a robbery and... Is given the choice of siding with a group of Eco-terrorists or the local police. This choice introduces the MORALITY METER. Yep. Postal has a MORALITY METER now. The ""Insanity"" path with the Eco-terrorists becomes a very Postal-esque story with the Dude still going around looking for work and not getting paid while the ""Good"" path has the Dude become a cop. 

With a predecessor that allowed you to do whatever you want in terms of your daily objectives, the choice of a binary system waggling it's finger at you for you being a good boy or a bad boy is just stupid. Not only that, but the game actively tells you off for going along the ""Insanity"" route and reaching the ending. Just a big ""Screw you for being bad, maybe be nicer and get a better ending."" 

The weapons are atrocious. Like if i have to hit a civilian or a cop five-six times point blank with a shotgun and they STILL get up, we have a problem. The molotovs don't linger for long and people on fire don't spread it by running into other people (WHICH POSTAL 2 HAD). The grenades can barely kill ANYTHING. The guns have the worst spread and accuracy ever, even aiming with the pistol i've seen shots miss my target because the bullet decided to go off in another direction entirely. 

I've had textures pop in and out of existence or flicker (very obvious when arresting people since the camera spins around) to the point where the sides of the bridge in the tutorial never appeared unless my camera was pointed in certain directions. The top of the bridge was fine, but the sides? Mostly non-existent. 

The game crashes are numerous and beyond intrusive. 

The achievements? Good luck. Most of them don't trigger properly after story segments, others don't count properly and some are just broken with no fixes or workarounds. 

Despite RWS coming out and removing the DRM and taking out three absolutely broken achievements among other fixes, this game still isn't worth your time. They don't even see a dollar from the sales still. This game completely shut down a Russian dev team (TrashMasters, how ironic since they made this piece of filth) and have almost rendered publisher Akella out of business. 

My good takeaways from this game is that i found one joke absolutely funny. The cutscenes were pretty well done. Corey Cruise did a pretty good job with voicing the Postal Dude. He came recommended from Rick Hunter himself as he was facing personal challenges as the game was in development. But most of all, Running with Scissors are some of the best developers around. They didn't need to bring this hellscape back on sale or bother making some fixes. But they did. All the while still working on Postal 4. 

I'm solely reviewing this game before Postal 2 since the Paradise Lost DLC rendered this entire campaign of nightmares non-canon.

Kısık ocakta tavanın kapağını kapatarak domateslerin iyice pişmesini bekleyin.
Domatesler çok suyu değil, tavaya yapışıyorsa birazcık kaynar su ekleyebilirsiniz. Genellikle de bu duruma gerek kalmayacaktır.
Fotoğraftaki gibi domatesler piştikten sonra yumurtaları kırabilirsiniz. Yumurtaları ister ayrı bir kapta çırpıp ekleyin isterseniz de benim gibi tavaya kırıp tavada karıştırabilirsiniz.

Non voglio concentrarmi troppo sulle caratteristiche del gioco, ma a mio parere, aver tolto la mappa libera, in favore di singoli livelli, è un grande punto a sfavore (originariamente doveva essere come il 2, ma è stata eliminata questa possibilità). Togliendo tutti i problemi presenti nel gioco, alla fine risulta comunque divertente da provare, ma sconsiglio comunque l'acquisto, a meno che non lo troviate a 1€ e vogliate provare questo strano gioco.","The story of Postal 3's creation is very troubled (and I won't go into it now). The game's quality is very poor, and even with the patch to remove the Russian DRM (which also brought some small improvements), the game remains riddled with problems and bugs that make it unplayable, with unpassable levels (without using skips or special maneuvers with the NPCs that follow you).
I don't want to focus too much on the game's features, but in my opinion, removing the free-roaming map in favor of individual levels is a major drawback (it was originally supposed to be like Postal 2, but this option was removed). Even with all the problems present in the game, it's still fun to play, but I still don't recommend buying it unless you find it for €1 and want to try this strange game."

Кхммм... Ну что ж. Смешанные чувства после этой игры. С одной стороны - есть проблемы с оптимизацией, вылетами и даже со звуком (Не такие критичные, как я себе представлял, но есть), с другой - норм отсылки (по моему), довольно нормальный сюжет и озвучка (хоть многие ей не довольны, но мне нравится). Но давайте всё по порядку. Ещё хочу поблагодарить одно руководство за предоставления подбора хороших модов, часть из которых я скачал. Вот ссылка:

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2913776987

[b] Теперь можно начать. [/b]

[h2] 1 - Оптимизация [/h2]

Даже не хочу оправдывать это. Оптимизация здесь - кусок говна. Я знаю, что у меня комп старый (сборка примерно 2009 г.), но чтобы игра шла НАСТОЛЬКО ПЛОХО - это пиздец. И даже если вы хотите понизить графику, чтобы повысить фпс, то это АБСОЛЮТНО БЕСПОЛЕЗНО! Игре пофиг, какие у тебя настройки графики (Всё равно фпс не изменится). Ещё хочу упомянуть ВЫЛЕТЫ. По началу они происходят редко (да и мне было как-то пофиг), но потом стало хуже. Я за +- 40-50 минут словил 4 ПЕРМАНЕНТНЫХ КРАША. Под словом ""Перманентный"" я говорю про то, что мне пришлось перезагружать комп, чтобы запустить снова игру (потому что с игрой виснет весь комп). Но после того, когда я скачал некоторые моды из руководства (которое находится выше), то вылеты прекратились и я смог пройти игру (хоть и с критически низким фпсом в некоторых моментах).

[h2] Саундтреки, Звук и Озвучка [/h2]

Для начала поговорим про Саунды. Они нормальные. Ну вот просто - нормальные. Лично у меня не было отвращения к ним. Но если они вам не нравится - в руководстве есть мод на замену некоторых саундтреков.
Теперь Звук. Тоже самое, что и с саундами - Нормальный. Больше нечего сказать.
Последнее - Озвучка. Она мне понравилась. Понимаю - что все бы хотели озвучку Александра Груздева (озвучивал Чувака из Второго Постала), но мне и эта озвучка нравится. Он такой ""киношно-мультяшный"" (по другому описать не могу) и мне он заходит.Но с ней есть один баг - при проигрывании какой-то фразы Чувака вместо фразы звучит машинно-трескающийся звук (как будто вы поместили колонки в воду). Но потом я вписал в консоль ""snd_rebuildaudiocache"" и у меня всё исправилось.

[h2] Графика и Эффекты [/h2]

Графика в целом выглядит тоже нормально. Не было никаких багов с текстурами (да и вообще мне как-то пох на графику), поэтому к ней у меня нет вопросов.
С эффектами дела обстоят примерно так же. Огонь, взрывы гранат, эффекты крови - нормально.

[h2] Интерфейс и Управление [/h2]

Теперь у нас вид от третьего лица и это мне не понравилось. Мне больше погружения вызывает вид от первого лица (ну во первых мне так больше нравится, а во вторых мне сложно прицеливаться от третьего лица). Ещё хочу упомянуть ""распределение оружия"". По началу я был дико недоволен тем, что всё оружие спихнули в одну ""линию"" и сказали ""разбирайся сам, где всё находится"", но потом я привык и мне даже стало удобнее пользоваться оружием через ""линию"", чем через ""разделы"" во втором постале. Всё остальное было норм.
Теперь управление. Тоже нормальное. Больше нечего сказать.

[h2] Сюжет и Геймплей [/h2]

Сюжет продолжает историю из Второго постала. После того, как мы выбрались из Парадиза - мы попадаем в Катарсис. На протяжении всей игры Чувак пытается заработать денег, но каждый раз (по всевозможным причинам) ему не могут заплатить и конце игры мы сбегаем из Катарсиса и всех наших врагов и тех, кто не смог заплатить нам денег, наказывают. Я могу рассказать про все попытки Чувака заработать, но мне лень.
Теперь про геймплей. Мы отправляемся на различные миссии для того, чтобы заработать деньги. И по началу они кажутся монотонными (по типу ""собери 15 кошек""), но спустя некоторое время возникает какой-то конфликт между Чуваком и какой-то группой людей, в результате чего помимо выполнения поставленной миссии, нужно попытаться не умереть (в общем как во втором постал). К сожалению нельзя поменять сложность и это меня расстраивает.

[h2] Итог [/h2]

POSTAL III - Неплохая игра. С одной стороны - тут мало вещей, вызывающие отвращение к этой игре, с другой стороны - ЭТО ЁБАНАЯ ОПТИМИЗАЦИЯ, БАГИ С ВЫЛЕТАМИ И ЭТОТ ЧЕРТОВСКИ НИЗКИЙ ФПС, которые перекрывают любые положительные эмоции от игры и заставляют незамедлительно сделать возврат денег.

До скорой встречи!","[h1] POSTAL III - Between ""Okay"" and ""Crap"" [/h1]

Hmmm... Well, I have mixed feelings about this game. On the one hand, there are issues with optimization, crashes, and even sound (not as critical as I imagined, but they're there). On the other hand, the references are okay (in my opinion), the story is pretty decent, and the voice acting (though many people aren't happy with it, I like it). But let's take things one step at a time. I also want to thank one guide for providing a selection of good mods, some of which I downloaded. Here's the link:

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2913776987

[b] Now we can begin. [/b]

[h2] 1 - Optimization [/h2]

I don't even want to justify it. The optimization here is a piece of crap. I know my computer is old (built around 2009), but for the game to run THIS BADLY is just insane. Even if you want to lower the graphics settings to increase your FPS, it's ABSOLUTELY USELESS! The game doesn't care what your graphics settings are (it won't change your FPS anyway). I also want to mention the CRASHES. At first, they were rare (and I didn't really care), but then it got worse. I experienced 4 PERMANENT CRASHES in about 40-50 minutes. By ""permanent,"" I mean I had to restart my computer to restart the game (because the game would freeze the entire computer). But after I downloaded some mods from the guide (which is above), the crashes stopped and I was able to complete the game (albeit with critically low FPS at some points).

[h2] Soundtracks, Audio, and Voice Acting [/h2]

First, let's talk about the sounds. They're okay. Well, just okay. Personally, I didn't dislike them. But if you don't like them, there's a mod in the guide that replaces some of the soundtracks.
Now, the sound. Same as with the sounds – okay. Nothing more to say.
Lastly, the voice acting. I liked it. I understand that everyone would like to hear Alexander Gruzdev (the voice of the Dude from the Second Postal), but I like this voice acting too. It's so ""cinematic-cartoonish"" (I can't describe it any other way), and I like it. But there's one bug: when playing one of the Dude's lines, a machine-like crackling sound plays instead (as if you've submerged the speakers in water). But then I entered ""snd_rebuildaudiocache"" in the console, and everything was fixed.

[h2] Graphics and Effects [/h2]

The graphics overall look fine. There were no texture bugs (and I don't really care about graphics anyway), so I have no issues with them.
The effects are about the same. Fire, grenade explosions, and blood effects are all fine.

[h2] Interface and Controls [/h2]

We now have a third-person view, and I didn't like that. I find the first-person view more immersive (firstly, I like it better, and secondly, I have trouble aiming in third-person). I also want to mention the ""weapon distribution."" At first, I was extremely unhappy with the fact that they shoved all the weapons into one ""line"" and told me to ""figure out where everything is yourself,"" but then I got used to it and even found it more convenient to use the weapons through the ""line"" than through the ""sections"" in the second post. Everything else was fine.
Now the controls. They're also fine. Nothing else to say.

[h2] Plot and Gameplay [/h2]

The plot continues the story from Post II. After escaping Paradise, we find ourselves in Catharsis. Throughout the game, the Dude tries to earn money, but each time (for various reasons) he can't get paid. At the end of the game, we escape Catharsis, and all our enemies and those who couldn't pay us are punished. I could tell you all about the Dude's attempts to earn money, but I'm too lazy.

Now about the gameplay. We go on various missions to earn money. At first, they seem monotonous (like ""collect 15 cats""), but after a while, some kind of conflict arises between the Dude and a group of people, which forces you to not only complete the assigned mission, but also try not to die (basically, like in Post II). Unfortunately, you can't change the difficulty, and that's frustrating.

[h2] Summary [/h2]

POSTAL III is a decent game. On the one hand, there are few things that make me hate it, but on the other hand, the FUCKING OPTIMIZATION, CRASH BUGS, and THIS CRASHING FPS overshadow any positive emotions I might have had from the game and make me want to immediately refund my money.

Из плюсов:
+ Игра стоит копейки.
+ Запускается на вашем компьютере.
+ Похожа на Постал (в том смысле, что в игре присутствует то самое ультранасилие).
+ Тупорылый юмор и озвучка, которые кому-то могут показаться забавными (поэтому запишем в плюсы).
+ Нелинейность. Есть возможность стать добрым полицейским, не убивать мирных жителей. Либо стать психом-террористом, расстреливая всех направо и налево. Из-за вашего выбора будут меняться уровни и задания.
 
Из минусов:
- Безынтересные миссии, где вас заставляют заниматься рутиной вроде собирания предметов или отстрела врагов.
- Ужасная графика. Даже по меркам 2011 года. Игра выглядит бедно и очень дешево.
- Нет открытого мира. Вся игра это набор миссий. Да, в ней есть относительно большие локации, но они в любом случае не сравнятся с уровнем карты из второй части.
- Наитупейший ИИ врагов и напарников, которые смотрят в стены, убегают от вас, или могут застрять в начале уровня, не давая вам закончить миссию.
- Хреновая стрельба. Чтобы убить врага нужно выстрелить в него 3-4 раза. На первые 2-3 выстрела враг не будет реагировать от слова совсем.  
- Отвратительный ближний бой, в котором стоя вплотную с толпой врагов и размахивая топором, вы не сможете никого убить.
- Долгие загрузки.
- Отсутствие оптимизации. FPS постоянно проседает. Поэтому придется смириться с просадками до 40-50 кадров. Особенно на больших локациях и во время перестрелок. Игре наплевать, какое у вас железо.
- Постоянные баги и ломающиеся скрипты. На третьей же миссии начались проблемы со звуком главного героя (смог решить). А во время миссии с патрулированием в городе сломался скрипт, который просто застопорил дальнейшее прохождение (пришлось перепроходить уровень с начала).
- Вылеты. На миссии с Уве Боллом игра просто крашится в одном и том же месте. Я не смог найти решения проблемы, которое возможно и есть. Не захотел. Это была последняя капля моего терпения.
 
Что же в итоге?
В связи с низкой стоимостью игры, ей можно было бы многое простить. И баги, и тормоза и все остальное, но, к сожалению, не вылеты, из-за которых игру пройти просто невозможно. Поэтому оформил возврат. Даже 50 рублей жалко отдавать за такое.","I bought this ""miracle"" at a discount for 50 rubles, right after the release of the patch in which the developers removed the DRM protection and ""optimized"" the game for modern hardware. I wanted to play some trash. I played it, thanks. I don't want to play it again.

Pros:
+ The game costs pennies.
+ Runs on your computer.
+ Similar to Postal (in the sense that the game contains that same ultra-violence).
+ Dumb humor and voice acting, which some might find funny (so we'll chalk that up as a plus).
+ Non-linearity. You can choose to be a good cop and not kill civilians. Or become a psychotic terrorist, shooting everyone left and right. Your choice will change the levels and missions.

Cons:
- Uninteresting missions where you're forced to do mundane things like collecting items or shooting enemies. - Terrible graphics. Even by 2011 standards. The game looks poor and very cheap.
- There's no open world. The entire game is a series of missions. Yes, it has relatively large locations, but they're nowhere near the level of the map from the second game.
- Stupid enemy and teammate AI: they stare at walls, run away from you, or can get stuck at the beginning of a level, preventing you from completing a mission.
- Terrible shooting. To kill an enemy, you need to shoot them 3-4 times. The enemy won't react at all to the first 2-3 shots.
- Horrible close-quarters combat, where standing close to a crowd of enemies and swinging an axe won't kill anyone.
- Long loading times.
- Lack of optimization. The FPS constantly drops. So you'll have to put up with frame rates dropping to 40-50 frames, especially in large locations and during firefights. The game doesn't care what hardware you have.
- Constant bugs and broken scripts. The main character's sound started to malfunction on the third mission (I was able to fix it). And during the city patrol mission, the script broke, completely freezing the game (I had to restart the level).
- Crashes. During the mission with Uwe Boll, the game just crashes in the same place. I couldn't find a solution to the problem, even if it was possible. I didn't want to. That was the last straw for me.

So what's the bottom line?
Considering the game's low price, a lot could be forgiven. Bugs, lag, and everything else, but unfortunately, not crashes that make the game simply unplayable. So I issued a refund. It's a shame to spend even 50 rubles on something like this."

149809471,ukrainian,2023.10.09 16:23,✅,✅,0.555555582,5,"Непонятно каким чудом я решил пройти третий Постал - одну из самых низкооценëнных игр во всей индустрии. Игру на релизе было за что ругать - баги, вылеты, кривой перевод и лаги. Прошло уже довольно много времени - разработчики оригинального Постала много шутили на тему 3 части, пока её в принципе не удалили из магазина. И вот, она вернулась. Пропатченная. Что теоретически должно избавить нас от багов, ведь так? 
Ну, справедливости ради, так оно и есть - за всё время игра у меня вылетела только два раза, лагов почти не было, как и проблем с игрой (за исключением того, что не всегда засчитывало убийства в счётчике для ачивок). К слову, неработающие ачивки удалили, что неописуемо радует. 
Вообще линейку ""Postal"" невозможно как-то оценивать на серьёзных щщах, ведь игры эти сделаны в качестве стёба на злободневные темы. Современные люди вряд-ли поймут шутки на тему того, что сегвеи - это гейство (так-то сегвеи и не часто на улице увидишь), что мексиканцы добавляют кошек и собак в буррито и тому подобные рофляночки. К счастью для игры и к несчастью для нас - многие шутки остаются актуальными и спустя 11 лет. 
Сюжет игры такой же е6анутый, как и во второй части - он, по сути, продолжает события Apocalypse Weekend. Теперь мы находимся в Катарсис-Сити, который не менее сумасшедший, чем Парадайз и стараемся, заработать денег на жизнь. Из положительных моментов - появились сюжетные развилки, позволяющие нам выбрать путь добра или зла. К тому же, это влияет на концовку, что крайне меня замотивировало пробежать всю игру с тазером ради ""святой"" концовки. 
Геймплей ничуть не изменился, за исключением того, что игра теперь от третьего лица, а не от первого. 
Графика вполне себе сносная, даже сейчас смотрится хорошо. 
Саундтрек в игре просто бомба, пожалуй это её лучшая часть))))) 
Говоря о недостатках игры:
1). Стрельба. Она неудобная и неприятная, у оружия космический разброс пуль и часто факт того, что голова противника находится на ""точке"" прицела, не означает, что одиночный выстрел поставит хэдшот;
2). Локации, а точнее открытый мир. Теперь игра разделена на уровни и мы не можем свободно разгуливать по городу, да выполнять задания. Фрироам открывается после полного прохождения игры, но и нужен только разве что добить некоторые достижения;
3). Сложность. Её нет. Наше оружие наносит противникам больше урона, чем их аналогичное. Есть система укрытий и автохил, словно это какая-то колда. Первые две части были намного хардкорнее в этом плане и было больше удовольствия от челленджа, который тебе преподносила игра. 
Если на выходе игра попросту была неиграбельна, то теперь она более-менее хорошо играется. Рекомендую к ознакомлению этот треш в хорошем смысле слова)",

Для тех кто хотел бы погрузиться в мир постала рекомендую начать со 2 (первая на любителя) ведь в 3 части много отсылок на 2 и идет плавный переход между ними.  Если идти по критериия то:
Графика: 7/10 (достойная для своего времени, не сильно режет глаз)
Сюжет: 9/10 (видно как проглядывается однотипность заданий, убей этого, спаси того и тд.)

Персонажи: 10/10 ( 0 скучных челов, все шизики с крутыми репликами)

As a big fan of the dude and Postal, I was pleased to see everything I saw in Postal 2, only packaged differently and powered by a new engine with a ton of new features. Obviously, if you were a Postal 2 fan, you'll probably enjoy this game 90% of the time, but if you're a Zoomer looking for the same old experience and atmosphere, you'll get nothing but a ton of crashes and bugs. 
For those looking to immerse themselves in the world of Postal, I recommend starting with Part 2 (the first one is a bit of an acquired taste), as Part 3 has a lot of references to Part 2 and a smooth transition between them. If we go by criteria:
Graphics: 7/10 (decent for its time, not too jarring)
Story: 9/10 (the repetitive nature of the missions is evident: kill this, save that, etc.)
Mechanics: 10/10 (I didn't encounter any issues)
Bugs: 5/10 (some are funny, others require a restart)
Characters: 10/10 (no boring characters, all crazy with cool lines)
Overall: 8.5/10

[b]Знаете игру впервые опробовал в году так 14-ом, но я прекрасно помню те моменты когда игру обсирания кому не лень. 
И знаете, с теми высказываниями я соглашусь.[/b] 

[h2] Русские которые ну даже не попробовали сделать хорошо.[/h2] 

[b]Как все знают над игрой работали не менее известные ребята из акеллы. И в каком то году они купили права на разработку третьей части грубо известной серии игр Постал. И там уже был первый звоночек. Но сейчас не буду говорить про разработку и иные вытекающие. Единственное что меня задело в этом плане, так это много отсылок для России, согласен, игра больше популярна у нас. Но блин, можно было сделать одну маленькую отсылочку и на этом бы хватило. Но блин этих отсылок не мало, один Мавроди чего стоит, и русская песня про водку в баре. Блин, это вообще не внедряется в колорит игры, тем более если держать в голове мысль что игра первоначально была с отсылочками на американскую культуру, не они в этой части тоже есть, но они перекочевали ещё из второй части. [/b] 

[h3] Спустя года, навсегда.[/h3]

[b]Что же изменилось за года? Как не странно акелла распалась в 2012 по моему. И соответственно игру никак не доработали, все баги, все фризы и остальное осталось и по сей день. Одна проблема с искажением реплик чувака чего стоит, что мне приходилось играть в некоторых моментах без наушников(В курсе что это можно пофиксить). Баги, багов в игре уйма, тот же баг с полицейским участком, где ты если убежал дальше полицейского, то любая последующая дверь может не открыться и велком перепроходить все по новой. Оптимизация, это вообще странная вещь, вроде и 100 фпс, но через секунду 23, и такие скачки происходят всю игру. И всякие мелкие недочеты, но они выявляются у каждого по своему.[/b]  

[h2]Короткий обзор, короткий итог [/h2] 

[b]Блин, даже сюжетка выходит короткая, если не косячить всю игру, и идти по одному пути, то игру можно пройти за 4 часа или меньше. Кстати да, в игре есть пути прохождения, а-ля,злой, добрый. И толком разницы нет, во всяком случае по любому пути игра проходится быстро, но концовки игры во всяком случае сводятся к тому что мы всех и вся наказываем.
Да, классно не спорю, круто что данная игра снова вышла в стиме, да это некая настольгия и все дела. И я согласен что игру можно купить ради коллекции, я сам так сделал, но и за одно решил её и пройти, так как ни разу не делал этого. И скажу одно, я больше её вообще не буду запускать, потому что такого бреда я еще раз не вывезу просто. Как для сырого инди проекта игра хороша, но не косит она под AAA проект. Так что если даже решишь её взять, бери по скидке, ибо 40 рублей не ибо много. Буду рекомендовать её из за цены и ностальгии и коллекции и не больше. Ибо играть в это, худо бедно невозможно. 
В общем, это было субъективное мое мнение, с которым тебе не особо стоит считаться, во всяком случае сделаешь по своему. Но я был бы рад, если ты этот обзор оценил как нибудь, может что нибудь полезное я тебе рассказал об игре, которое поспособствовало к твоему решению о покупке.[/b]

[b]You know, I first tried the game back in '14, but I vividly remember those moments when everyone was trashing it.

And you know, I agree with those statements.[/b] 

[h2] The Russians, who didn't even try to make it good.[/h2] 

[b]As everyone knows, the game was worked on by the equally famous guys from Akella. And some year they bought the rights to develop a third installment in the notorious Postal series. And that was the first warning sign. But I won't talk about the development and other consequences now. The only thing that bothered me in this regard was the many references to Russia. I agree, the game is more popular here. But damn, one small reference could have been enough. But damn, there are quite a few of these references; Mavrodi alone is worth something, and the Russian song about vodka in a bar. Damn, this doesn't really fit into the game's flavor, especially considering that the game originally had references to American culture. They're not in this game either, but they migrated from the second game. [/b] 

[h3] Years later, forever.[/h3]

[b]What's changed over the years? Oddly enough, Akella disbanded in 2012, I think. And accordingly, the game hasn't been improved at all; all the bugs, freezes, and everything else remain to this day. The problem with the guy's garbled lines alone is enough to make me play without headphones in some parts (I know it can be fixed). There are tons of bugs in the game, including the police station bug where, if you run past the policeman, any subsequent door might not open, and you have to replay it all over again. Optimization is a weird thing. It seems like it's 100 fps, but then it drops to 23 seconds later, and these fluctuations persist throughout the entire game. And there are all sorts of minor issues, but they manifest themselves differently for everyone. [/b] 

[h2]Short overview, short summary [/h2] 

[b]Damn, even the storyline is short. If you don't screw up the entire game and stick to one path, you can complete the game in 4 hours or less. By the way, yes, the game does have paths, like good and evil. And it doesn't really make a difference; in any case, the game is quickly completed on either path, but the endings always boil down to us punishing everyone and everything.
Yeah, it's great, I agree. It's cool that this game is back on Steam. It's a bit of a nostalgia thing, and all that. And I agree that you can buy the game for the collection. I did that myself, but I also decided to play through it at the same time, since I've never done that before. And I'll say one thing: I won't be playing it again, because I simply can't stand such nonsense. It's good for a raw indie project, but it's not exactly a AAA title. So even if you decide to pick it up, get it on sale, because 40 rubles isn't much. I recommend it for the price, nostalgia, and collection, nothing more. Because it's impossible to play, at least not at all.

In short, this was my subjective opinion, which you shouldn't really take into account; you'll make your own judgment anyway. But I'd be glad if you gave this review a rating; maybe I told you something useful about the game that contributed to your purchase decision.

However, now its status is semi-canon, with the events here taking place during Postal Dude's coma and the Dude we play here is his alternate personality as stated in the P2 DLC Paradise Lost. A major update in October 2023 fixed many things, making the game more stable and fully playable, at least in my experience.

Unlike P2, which was first-person and open-world, P3 is played from a third-person perspective and the missions are more similar to Apocalypse Weekend, being one missions after another instead of errands we do in a free-roam city. And I think it's a weird choice, since there is a free-roam map, but it's only purpose is for you to walk around, no missions. Maybe they're trying to make a more focused linear experience, but instead it makes the game feel disjointed.

Story-wise, there are 2 paths you can follow, Good or Insane, with similar, but sometimes different missions. It's recommended to try both paths, since if you play only one, the game isn't actually that long, and they have different story achievements. While adding a good path on Postal game might seem like a weird choice it doesn't seem that out of character since he still retains a similar sarcastic view and humor.

One of the biggest issues with this game is that it feels unpolished and unfinished, even after the update. And yes, sadly it's true. The movement feels stiff, weapon switching is messy, a useless open world with no map, no subtitles, and its unoptimized, sometimes it lags despite not being a heavy game. Some broken achievements have been removed, but some are still broken, only counting during specific events or something unrelated at all. Like how the ""capture terrorist"" one only counts when defeating the meth rhino boss.

While it's obviously still a broken game, with the update I think Postal III is worth a try, and if you enjoy the franchise and want more you might as well play the semi-canon content. It's honestly not that bad, and still has a pretty similar vibe to Postal 2, just not as good. If you don't expect a masterpiece you'd still have fun here.","Postal III was originally set as a sequel to Postal 2, but the game was so notoriously bad and buggy, the creators of the franchise disowned it.

And I think it's a weird choice, since there is a free-roam map, but it's only purpose is for you to walk around, no missions. Maybe they're trying to make a more focused linear experience, but instead it makes the game feel disjointed.

Story-wise, there are 2 paths you can follow, Good or Insane, with similar, but sometimes different missions. It's recommended to try both paths, since if you play only one, the game isn't actually that long, and they have different story achievements. While adding a good path on Postal game might seem like a weird choice it doesn't seem that out of character since he still retains a similar sarcastic view and humor.

One of the biggest issues with this game is that it feels unpolished and unfinished, even after the update. And yes, sadly it's true. The movement feels stiff, weapon switching is messy, a useless open world with no map, no subtitles, and its unoptimized, sometimes it lags despite not being a heavy game. Some broken achievements have been removed, but some are still broken, only counting during specific events or something unrelated at all. Like how the ""capture terrorist"" one only counts when defeating the meth rhino boss.

While it's obviously still a broken game, with the update I think Postal III is worth a try, and if you enjoy the franchise and want more you might as well play the semi-canon content. It's honestly not that bad, and still has a pretty similar vibe to Postal 2, just not as good. If you don't expect a masterpiece you'd still have fun here."

Подарил мне эту каку с сюжетом ""сон собаки"" один сибирский пёс, я её прошёл впринципе на челендж. Расстраивают конечно баги, неудобства управления, а ещё общественное мнение о том, что это якобы худшая часть. 
2го Сэма так то тоже говном поливают, но он ахуенен. 3й Дум поливают - но он по-своему хорош.
Этой игруле можно дать шанс, но она всё же местами багованая, особенно ачивы, с неудобным управлением, немного дисбалансовая и довольно короткая.

Сюжэт - хрен пойми, как будто после событий 2й части мы попали ещё куда-то и теперь у нас выбор на уровне ""два стула"", т.е. будет Чувак кентом или ментом, в любом случае хреново не будет... Ему по крайней мере, на остальных насрать.

Геймплюй блеать: ходим, выполняем задания - где-то надо убивать, где-то нет, на ""хороший"" финал лучше вообще не убивать никого, а на плохой надо сразу выбирать сторону козлов. В этой части ВНЕЗАПНО есть ТРАНСПОРТ, но это ёбаные в роту пидорские сигвеи... С коих можно только с песталета лупить, ""СКОЛЬКО ПАСТАЛЕТОВ В ПАТРОНЕ? Сулька!"" (с) Туплинов.
Ещё прикольный момент, что тут мы мочим Таблиов, Венесуэльцев, ""Яжемамок"" и ""Экотологов"" но при том не трогаем геев и даже защищаем Уве Болла, хотя ему хочется У-въебать... Хотя на плохую с альтернативной стороны наверно вообще мочим всё что движется. 

вид от 3го, что малость непривычно, управление немного через задницу - на ""пробел"" не прыжок, а укрытие, инвентарь и оружие в одной куче, бензин часто не поджигается, куча багов до сих пор, грены кидать хитровыебанно как-то.
ЗАТО есть оружие-БАРСУК (как безнопила), пчелобомбы (привет Громозаврам), и нахер не нужны баблосы. 

Кто-то скажет ""Акела промахнулся"", я скажу - Бегающие с ножницами добегались и не с теми связались.

","Rostaline 3, or ""Champa's catnip dream""

A Siberian dog gave me this piece of crap with the ""dog's dream"" plot, and I basically completed it as a challenge. The bugs, the awkward controls, and the public perception that this is supposedly the worst game are frustrating.
Sam 2 gets trashed too, but it's awesome. Doom 3 gets trashed, but it's good in its own way.
This game can be given a chance, but it's still buggy in places, especially the achievements, has awkward controls, is a bit unbalanced, and is rather short.

The plot is a mess, as if after the events of the second game we ended up somewhere else and now we have a choice like ""two chairs,"" i.e. Whether Dude is a friend or a cop, it won't be a bad thing either way... At least he doesn't give a shit about the others.

The gameplay is fucking awesome: we walk around, complete missions—sometimes you have to kill, sometimes you don't. For the ""good"" ending, it's best not to kill anyone at all, and for the bad ending, you have to immediately choose the side of the assholes. In this part, there's SUDDENLY TRANSPORTATION, but they're fucking faggot-like Segways... From which you can only shoot with a pistol, ""HOW MANY PASTELETS ARE IN A CARTRIDGE? Sulka!"" (c) Tuplinov.
Another cool thing is that here we kill Tablios, Venezuelans, ""Yazhemamok,"" and ""Ecotologists,"" but at the same time, we leave gays alone and even defend Uwe Boll, even though he wants to kick our asses... Although, on the bad side, from the alternative side, we probably kill everything that moves.

The view from the 3rd game is a bit unusual, the controls are a bit sloppy – the spacebar doesn't jump, but rather takes cover, inventory, and weapons all in one place, the gasoline often doesn't ignite, there are still a ton of bugs, and throwing grains is kind of tricky.
AT THE OTHER THING, there's the BADGER weapon (like a chainsaw), bee bombs (hello, Thunderosaurs), and you don't need any money.

Someone might say, ""Akela missed,"" but I'll say, ""The Scissor Runners ran too long and messed with the wrong people.""
Oh well, you can play this for free. They say the 4th game is even worse.

Those were the words my brother told me when he gifted me this game to play as he knows how much I enjoy the Postal series. I admit I was a little worried at first knowing of the reputation this game had but at the same time excited to see just how truly horrible this game was.

First off the game is buggy especially in the achievement department making them a rather pain to get and it had nothing to do with player skill. I also did not enjoy using melee weapons at all where they were a joy to use in Postal 2 and in Postal 4. 

During the opening mission in the game where it taught you how to use the gasoline can and matches to set fires, it felt really awkward to do and I had trouble trying to set the zombies on fire where as in Postal 2 and Postal 4 it is nowhere near as difficult to do. This made me think that either Postal does not translate well as a third person shooter game or the team just had a rough time trying to make it work. In this regard Postal 2 and Postal 4 are more fun to play in the first person perspective and I wonder if staying first person would have helped Postal 3.

Another thing that felt off for me was the urine mechanics. Usually if you were on fire you get Postal Dude to look up and urinate and the fire would be extinguished, it was in no way shape or form an easy task in Postal 3 to the point where I don't even know if that mechanic even works.

As for crashes the game surprisingly did not crash nearly as much as I was fearing it would. I honestly had more crashes trying to play an Elder Scrolls and Fallout game. There was one particularly bad time however in the mission where I was escorting a cop to the basement where I honestly thought about quitting the game. I however restarted the mission from the beginning and got it to work without crashing. Honestly I have never quick saved so much in a game in my life.

Thankfully I was able to get my Xbox controller to work after going into the config.cfg file and changing joystick = 0 to joystick = 1 but the keyboard and mouse were still necessary for using the main menu. 

Upon completing the game going down both paths I feel that Postal 3 is the weakest Postal game and feels more like a fan game made by people who really love the series, but didn't let it fully cook. As janky as the game maybe and frustrating parts that I would never want to deal with again (I am looking at you rhino boss fights), I do not think Postal 3 is as horrible as it's reputation would have you to believe.

There is some fun to be found in this game. I had way more fun arresting people than I thought I would have and really like how that was brought back into Postal 4.

At the end of the day Postal 3 is janky, that cannot be denied, however I feel that if you are a fan of the series and have never played Postal 3 it is worth a shot if you catch it on sale. Postal, Postal Redux, Postal 2, Postal 4 and Postal Brain Damaged will always be the superior Postal games and the ones that should be recommended to new comers to the series, but Postal 3 deserves a little bit of love too. I can see myself coming back to it again even though the rhino fights annoy me greatly, perhaps I will just skip those.","""This can't be good for you, but I feel great for this. Buckle Up""

[h3]Глюки[/h3]

Казалось прошло более 10 лет, а косяки как были, так и остались. Глюк с озвучкой чувака каеф, что аж пришлось по руководству лезть в консоль. Также игра периодически крашилась, что бурной радости у меня по понятным причинам не вызывало. В начале: словил ""жука"" на управлении, 10 минут пытался убить зомби бензином, трижды взрывал 1 противника гранатой. По ходу игры в основном были проблемы все с той же канистрой и базукой, в остальном особых дефектов не заметил. 

[h3]Сюжет[/h3]

Зачем было в рофельную пострелушку сувать систему кармы не понятно. Прибыв в катарсис Чувак встает перед проблемой: денег нет, но вы держитесь (вам всего доброго и хорошего настроения). В попытке заработать малеха наличных он начинает бороздить новый город в поисках работы. Не знаю почему, но мне показалось, что вторая часть в плане юмора была лучше. Если говорить про сюжетную линию их грубо говоря 2: за полицию и за бомжей [spoiler]если хотите хорошую, то вам за копов[/spoiler]. Ну а дальше сами разберетесь. Из недостатков мне не понравилось, что в обоих сюжетах +- повторяются некоторые моменты, которые... ну как объяснить? В одном случае события провоцирует сам Чувак, в другом происходит то же самое, но это... как бы... сделал какой-то ноунейм... Короче игра старая, поэтому сильно не зацикливайтесь на этом моменте. На две концовки у меня ушло шесть с половиной часов.

[h3] Наполнение мира [/h3]

 Все те же всеми нами любимые ""активисты"", готовые гасить всех по какому угодно поводу. Представители ""самой мирной религии"" (как бы меня не убили за такую штуку). Все как мы любим абсурд на абсурде и абсурд погоняет! В большинство локаций даже зайти нельзя, они просто для галочки. Хз почему, но вторая часть также мне кажется более обширной в плане карты. Впрочем для игры 11 года и за полтиник простительно.

[h3]Также:[/h3]
-НПС наяривающий на обезглавленный труп.
-враги выдерживающие в пузо 3 разяда дроби.
-либо картонные, либо стальные черепа врагов иной раз выдерживающие по 2-3 попадания к ряду.
-""метящий"" углы бомж.
-ракетница, которая взрывается в руках.
-ООООО! Привет, Кротчи! Ты еще жив? Сча исправим!
-""за что ты ненавидишь Америку?""
-""постойте, а разве толерантно убивать женщин и черных?""","Well, what can I say? It's a cool game, and for fifty bucks, it's a must-have. It's just not without its flaws.

[h3]Glitches[/h3]

It felt like more than 10 years had passed, and the glitches were still there. The glitch with the guy's voice acting was so bad I had to go to the console to find the manual. The game also crashed periodically, which, for obvious reasons, didn't exactly thrill me. At the beginning, I got a bug with the controls, spent 10 minutes trying to kill zombies with gasoline, and blew up an enemy three times with a grenade. As the game progressed, I mostly had problems with the same canister and bazooka, but otherwise, I didn't notice any major issues.

[h3]Plot[/h3]

It's unclear why they even included a karma system in a silly shoot-em-up. Having reached catharsis, the Dude faces a problem: he's out of money, but you hang in there (all the best and good cheer to you). Trying to earn a little cash, he begins to roam the new city in search of work. I don't know why, but I thought the second game was better in terms of humor. Speaking of storylines, there are roughly two: for the police and for the homeless [spoiler]if you want a good one, then you're on the cops[/spoiler]. Well, you'll figure it out for yourself. One of the downsides I didn't like was that both plots more or less repeat certain elements, which... well, how can you explain it? In one case, the Dude himself provokes the events, in the other, the same thing happens, but it's... sort of... created by some unknown... In short, the game is old, so don't dwell on this too much. It took me six and a half hours to get through the two endings.

[h3] Filling the World [/h3]

The same old favorite ""activists,"" ready to kill anyone for any reason. Representatives of the ""most peaceful religion"" (I hope they don't kill me for that). Just how we love absurdity upon absurdity, and absurdity upon absurdity! You can't even enter most of the locations; they're just there for show. I don't know why, but the second part also seems more expansive to me in terms of maps. However, for a game from 2011, even for a 50-dollar game, it's forgivable.

[h3]Also:[/h3]
-NPCs groaning at a decapitated corpse.
-enemies that can withstand three shots to the gut.
-enemies' skulls, either cardboard or steel, can sometimes withstand two or three hits in a row.
-a homeless person ""marking"" corners.
-a flare gun that explodes in your hands.
-OOOOOH! Hey, Krotchi! You're still alive? We'll fix it in a minute!
-""Why do you hate America?""

Позже, начав проходить её уже самостоятельно и осмысленно, с чувством, с толком, с расстановкой, я был в восторге от черного юмора, интересных и весёлых заданий в таком уютном и уже родном для меня Пэрадайзе. Разработчиком и издателем выступала американская группа разработчиков компьютерных игр Running with Scissors, выпустив сие творение в 2003 году.
К моменту выхода 3 части серии я уж и забыл о ней, а посмотрев на кадры геймплея из скриншотов , и соотношения положительных и отрицательных отзывов я подумал, что это явно не то пальто, и сшито оно не так. И, как оказывается, не ошибался.
Тут у нас издателем является не какой-нибудь ксуй с горы, а Акелла, чей логотип разрабатывал по внешнему виду упоротого волка либо Артемий Лебедев либо бомж за фунфырик. Ну а *разработчиком* - прекрасная студия создателей адовой xyeты – Trashmasters. Название говорит само за себя. Как вообще так получилось, что они приняли участие в разработке и издании франшизы – для меня загадка со звёздочкой. Ну а так как делали игру – [b]НАШИ[/b], то и получилось с [strike]душой[/strike].
Сразу и мгновенно у меня потекла кровь из ушей от громкости музыки и звука уже в меню. Пришлось выкрутить его на самый минимум. Ну а перед этим мне пришлось под тремя лупами всматриваться в окошечко настроек, ведь на фулл хд этот сорсевский квадратик, оказывается, не растягивается. 
Когда уже казалось, что хуже уже не будет – начинается долгожданный геймплей. Управление в этой игре похоже портировалось с какой-то мобильной залупы, ибо в 2011 – год выхода сиквела и триквела Ассасинов, видеть вот такое вот и без трёхэтажного мата передвигаться по карте, вступая в конфронтацию с противником – задача непосильная даже монахам Шаолиня. Начинается обучение всем основам на мосту – нам нужно по нему пройти. Показывается катсцена с графикой и проработкой персонаже, которой вторая часть дает на клыка. Горит красная стрелка у красной машины, нам явно нужно туда. Ну вот подошел я туда, встал. Что? ЧТО, BLYAT мне тут нужно сделать? Пригнуться? Нет, тут нет приседаний. Пойти в таран на стреляющих солдат? Нет, оттуда он выбежать не может. Я уже поссал даже в этом eбyчем углу между двух машин и когда уже думал закрывать игру – началась вторая катсцена. Я не буду описывать всё моё прохождение, тем более, что через минут 20-30, на миссии с отловом кошек она сама у меня закрылась, выдав какую-то ошибку. Хотя возможно игра считывает твое психическое состояние и специально закрывается в самый критический момент, я не в курсе. В этот момент я отчаянно сражался как лев с работниками ресторана, которые этих кошек у себя подают. СУKA, ДА КАК МОЖНО СДЕЛАТЬ ТАКОЕ УEБИЩНОЕ УПРАВЛЕНИЕ И БОЕВУЮ СИСТЕМУ, КОСОРУКИЕ УРОДЫ.
Как итог, за 40 рублей я бы лучше бахнул Балтики 9 по акции, ну а так плюс еще один треш в мою библиотеку.
","Once upon a time, after school, I'd go over to a friend's house to play Postal 2, chase people around asking them to sign a petition, stroll past beautiful women with my fly unzipped, and simply cause a bloodbath by walking into a neighbor's house, where hard rock was blasting at full blast. Later, when I started playing it on my own, with purpose, feeling, and deliberation, I was delighted by the dark humor, interesting, and fun missions in the cozy and now familiar Paradise. The developer and publisher was the American computer game group Running with Scissors, releasing this creation in 2003. By the time the third installment of the series came out, I'd already forgotten about it. After looking at the gameplay footage from the screenshots and the positive-to-negative feedback, I thought it was definitely the wrong coat, and it wasn't made right. And, as it turns out, I was right.

The publisher here isn't some punk, but Akella, whose logo was designed by either Artemy Lebedev or a homeless person for a penny based on the appearance of a stoned wolf. And the *developer* is the wonderful studio behind the hellish Xyeta – Trashmasters. The name speaks for itself. How they even ended up participating in the development and publishing of the franchise is a mystery to me. And since the game was made by [b]OURS[/b], it turned out to have [strike]soul[/strike].
My ears immediately started bleeding from the volume of the music and the sound in the menu. I had to turn it down to the lowest setting. Before that, I had to peer into the settings window with three magnifying glasses, because on Full HD, that Source-specific square, it turns out, doesn't stretch.

Just when I thought things couldn't get any worse, the long-awaited gameplay begins. The controls in this game seem to have been ported from some mobile crap, because in 2011—the year the Assassins' Secret Service sequel and threequel were released—seeing this and navigating the map without swearing and engaging in combat with enemies was a challenge even for Shaolin monks. A tutorial on the basics begins on a bridge—we need to cross it. A cutscene plays, featuring graphics and character development that the second game gives to the fang. A red arrow flashes next to the red car; we clearly need to go there. So, I walk over there and stand. What? WHAT THE FUCK am I supposed to do here? Crouch? No, there are no squats here. Ram the soldiers shooting? No, he can't run out of there. I'd already pissed myself in that fucking corner between two cars, and just when I was about to close the game, the second cutscene started. I won't describe my entire playthrough, especially since after 20-30 minutes, during the cat-catching mission, it closed on its own, giving me some kind of error. Although, maybe the game is reading your mental state and deliberately closing at the most critical moment, I don't know. At that moment, I was desperately fighting like a lion with the restaurant workers who serve these cats. HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU CREATE SUCH A CRAPPY CONTROLS AND COMBAT SYSTEM, YOU CLUELESS MORONS.
Ultimately, for 40 rubles, I'd rather have the Baltika 9 on sale, and that's another trash game for my library."

Postal 3 is an absolute abomination of a video game, and I wouldn't wish the experience of playing it on my worst enemy. It's a steaming pile of digital excrement that somehow manages to make its predecessors look like masterpieces.

First and foremost, the graphics in Postal 3 are an eyesore. It's as if the developers intentionally set out to create the ugliest, most visually offensive game possible. The character models are blocky and grotesque, the environments are bland and uninspired, and the overall art direction is an affront to good taste.

The gameplay is equally abysmal. The controls are clunky and unresponsive, making even basic tasks a chore. The AI is laughably bad, with enemies that either stand around like cardboard cutouts or engage in erratic, unpredictable behavior that makes combat a frustrating exercise in futility. The game's open-world structure is a complete mess, with a lack of direction and purpose that leaves you wandering aimlessly through a world that's about as engaging as a post-apocalyptic wasteland without any of the cool factors.


The technical issues in Postal 3 are too numerous to count. It's riddled with bugs, crashes, and performance problems that make it nearly unplayable. It's clear that this game was rushed to release, with little care or attention to quality.

In summary, Postal 3 is an absolute trainwreck of a game. It's an embarrassment to the medium, a stain on the Postal franchise, and a waste of your time and money. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this abomination. There are countless better games out there that deserve your attention, and Postal 3 is not one of them.

Сделали они (на самом деле не они), значится, ""патч"", фиксящий игру и вернули игру на продажу, хотя ранее игру активно засирали, сами топили за удаление её с магазина Стим, постили унижающие посты по поводу Постал 3 (камон, у них даже баннер одного из бандлов по серии Постала про то, что Постал 3 - говно и его следует вернуть отправителю). Но ладно бы сделали патч, они его даже не удосужились доделать. 

Начать стоит с того, что этот самый патч с фиксами делали НЕ РВС, а попросту взяли версию из ZOOM. РВС лишь убрали DRM, а остальные заслуги присвоили себе. 

Безусловно, оптимизацию была поднята, некоторые баги исправлены, убрали надоедливый DRM и довели игру до вполне играбельного состояния, которого не смогли добиться Трэшмастерс и Акелла, но половину из обещанного в патчноуте РВС не удосужились добавить. Ту же Гама-пушку, облегчающую в разы прохождение на Пацифисте, так и не добавили, из-за чего лично я, прочитавший до покупки игры патчноут, был разочарован. Баги с озвучкой (например, неприятные для ушей звуки в виде звуковых артефактов) так и не были пофикшены. Обещанный FGD не был добавлен, а ведь это могло дать толчок для моддинга. 

Вообщем-то, РВС накормили игроков пустыми обещаниями, а сами не сделали толком ничего, заявив, что заняты крайне ущербным Постал 4.","Postal 3 is undoubtedly an underrated masterpiece of the gaming industry, surpassing Postal 4, but RVS screwed up again even with this.

So they (not really them) created a ""patch"" that fixed the game and returned it to retail, even though they'd previously actively trashed the game, campaigned for its removal from the Steam store, and posted disparaging posts about Postal 3 (come on, they even have a banner for one of the Postal series bundles saying Postal 3 is crap and should be returned to the sender). But it would have been fine if they'd made a patch, but they didn't even bother to finish it.

It's worth starting with the fact that this patch with the fixes wasn't made by RVS; they simply took the ZOOM version. RVS only removed the DRM and took the rest of the credit.

Of course, optimization was improved, some bugs were fixed, the annoying DRM was removed, and the game reached a playable state that Trashmasters and Akella couldn't achieve, but RWS didn't bother adding half of what they promised in the patch notes. The Gama Gun, which makes playing on the Pacifist much easier, was never added, which left me personally disappointed, even though I read the patch notes before purchasing the game. Voice acting bugs (for example, unpleasant audio artifacts) were never fixed. The promised FGD was not added, which could have spurred modding.

Basically, RWS fed players with empty promises and then delivered nothing, claiming to be busy with the extremely flawed Postal 4."

Wait for [url=https://www.moddb.com/mods/catharsis-reborn]Catharsis Reborn[/url] if you want to see how it could have looked and played if it wasn't rushed, or [url=https://www.moddb.com/mods/postal-3-unreal]Postal Unreal[/url], if you want a more classic FPS Postal experience akin to Postal 2.

A tak już bez memów i po przejściu: 

Ta gra to czysty zmarnowany potencjał. Boli jak w to się gra z wielu powodów, optymalizacja i beznadziejne wykonanie to jedno, ale najbardziej boli fakt że chciałoby się zobaczyć tą produkcję dopracowaną technicznie chociaż na poziomie postala 4 (czyli beznadziejnie, ale działa). Tak, ona mogłaby być aż tak dobra. ""Mogła"" to jednak słowo klucz. 

Nie będę owijał nie warto w to grać, bo to po prostu nie działa. Sterowanie, strzelanie, podpalanie, siuranie- wszystko działa źle. Ostatnia misja to nieporozumienie i bez godmoda żadnej przyjemności z tego nie idzie wykrzesać. Wrogowie spawnujący się na potęgę, HP w formie odnawiania, ograniczony arsenał- to są kroki wstecz względem wiekowej 2 części. 

Technikalia to jedno, druga rzecz to klimat. Postal 3 ma klimat i ma duszę, ale widać że twórcy się śpieszyli i były jakieś spory w trakcie produkcji. Fabuła jest chaotyczna, otrzymujemy wręcz streszczenie streszczenia z najważniejszymi momentami i to w postaci tablic tekstu xD Tu ewidentnie coś poszło nie tak a wielka szkoda. Potencjał był ogromny, zaśmiałem się pod nosem w wielu momentach- czyli gierka wywołała u mnie efekty których nie wywołała 4 część. Jak macie czas- obejrzyjcie sobie na youtubie gameplay, fani postala przede wszystkim. 

To jest dramat, że tak potraktowano tą produkcję. Sporo dobrych momentów. zabawnych zwrotów akcji, absurdalny ale ciekawy pomysł na fabułę, gameplay z dobrą i odświeżającą dla serii mechaniką karmy, bronie i gadżety na poziomie kreatywności z Ratcheta i Clanka- dało się z tego zrobić dobrą grę. Niestety mamy dramat. Lepsze od postala 4 pod względem fabularnym i przedstawienia Kolesia, ale nie warto się męczyć i grać w to. 


Na zakończenie, jest fanowski projekt przeniesienia P3 na silnik Unreala- życzę im jak najlepiej. Postal 4, Lost Paradise i Brain Damage czerpią garściami z oryginalnej trójki, warto jej więc dać jeszcze jedną szansę.","Better than Postal 4

And now, without the memes and after beating it:

This game is pure wasted potential. It hurts to play it for many reasons. The optimization and terrible execution are one thing, but what hurts most is the fact that you'd like to see this game technically refined, even on the level of Postal 4 (which is to say, terrible, but it works). Yes, it could have been that good. ""Could have"" is the key word.

I won't go into detail: it's not worth playing, because it simply doesn't work. The controls, shooting, setting fires, peeing – everything works poorly. The final mission is a mess, and without a godmod, you can't derive any enjoyment from it. Enemies spawning in droves, HP regenerating, a limited arsenal – these are steps back from the age-old second installment.

Technical aspects are one thing, but the atmosphere is another. Postal 3 has atmosphere and soul, but it's clear the developers were in a hurry and there were some disputes during development. The plot is chaotic; we're given a summary of the most important moments, all in the form of text tables. xD Something clearly went wrong here, and it's a real shame. The potential was enormous; I laughed out loud at many points – meaning the game evoked emotions in me that Postal 4 didn't. If you have the time, watch the gameplay on YouTube; Postal fans are the first to do so.

It's a shame this game was treated this way. There are plenty of good moments, funny plot twists, an absurd but interesting plot idea, gameplay with a good and refreshing karma mechanic for the series, weapons and gadgets on par with the creativity of Ratchet and Clank – it could have been made into a good game. Unfortunately, we get a disaster. It's better than Postal 4 in terms of story and the Dude's presentation, but it's not worth the effort and playing.

Finally, there's a fan project to port Postal 3 to the Unreal engine – I wish them the best. Postal 4, Lost Paradise, and Brain Damage all draw heavily from the original three, so it's worth giving it another chance."

2. То, что убрали свободу действий и добавили ""бесполезные"" миссии.
3. И то, что голос ЛЕГЕНДАРНОГО Груздева заменили Кураж Бамбе'ем

Как человек ,который любит эту серию скажу, что из-за этих придирок игра никак не стала хуже. Что я думаю об Postal 3? 

1. Высмеивание культуры людей в третий части ни чуть не изменилось.
Postal 2 высмеивал всё вывесками с рекламой, названием всяких компаний а так же поведением и диалогами чувака и пешеходов. Третья часть в основном высмеивается фразами нашего ГГ и сценарием миссий. Где вы найдёте в других играх миссию, где на полицейский участок нападают бездомные? Правильно,нигде. И как по мне это забавно, но кому-то не сильно смешно с этого.

2. ДА,открытого мира во время миссий нет. !Но вся карта открывается после прохождения сюжета!(за 4-5 часов сюжет проходиться). Миссии как по мне прикольная вещь для Postal 3. Во второй части мы просто выполняли поручения на день, но в тройке мы просто по сюжету пытаемся хоть как-то заработать денег выполняя эти миссии.

Ну и 3. Голос Кураж Бамбе'я ни чуть не хуже Александра Груздева. Из-за того, что мы ожидали Груздева повторно мы сильно занизили оценку игры. Разработчики хотели придать голосу то самое чувство старой озвучки в фильмах,но чуть просчитались и звучит это всё как дешёвый сериал. Но тут уже вкусовщина.

*Из минусов только небольшие посадки кадров и сломанный звук некоторых фраз чувака.*
Смело могу поставить 8,9/10
","Most people dislike Postal 3 citing (1) the game's lack of open mockery of everything.
2) the removal of freedom of action and the addition of ""useless"" missions.
3) and the replacement of the LEGENDARY Gruzdev's voice with Courage Bambaem.

As someone who loves the series, I can say that these quibbles haven't made the game any worse. What do I think of Postal 3?

1) The mockery of human culture hasn't changed a bit in the third game.
Postal 2 mocked everything with advertising signs, company names, and the behavior and dialogue of the guy and the pedestrians. The third game mostly mocks our protagonist's lines and mission scripts. Where in other games will you find a mission where homeless people attack a police station? That's right, nowhere. And I find it funny, but some people don't find it so funny.

2. YES, there's no open world during missions! But the entire map opens up after completing the story! (The story takes 4-5 hours to complete). I think the missions are a cool feature of Postal 3. In the second game, we simply completed daily assignments, but in Postal 3, we're simply trying to earn some money by completing these missions, as part of the story.

And 3. Kurazh Bambeya's voice is every bit as good as Alexander Gruzdev's. Because we were expecting Gruzdev to be playing again, we significantly lowered the game's rating. The developers wanted to give the voice that same feel of old-school movie voiceovers, but they miscalculated slightly, and it all sounds like a cheap TV series. But that's a matter of taste.

*The only downsides are minor frame drops and the broken sound of some of the guy's lines.*
I can confidently give it an 8.9/10.

Everyone says this game is bad, and well, it is. But, I think RWS have actually gone and patched a lot of bugs throughout the game actually making it playable! Here i have made a list of pros and cons I experienced with the game:

Pros
- Humour can be funny at times
- Lots of interesting weapons and features we never got in any other postal games
- Mostly fun achievements 
- Not always a completely boring game, some missions I found to be quite fun in fact
- Better gore, nothing more satisfying than shooting an innocent bystanders face off
- Runs better than it did at og release, I experienced little crashes and little to no frame drops more than what can be said for postal 4
- Cory is a really good voice actor for postal dude and was probably the best part of this game character wise, not that there was any competition for that title in the postal series
- Regenerating health, say good bye to your crack and fast food because now you regenerate your health back, some people could see this as a pro or con but as much as I love the infamous 'Health pipe' gag in postal, being stuck without healing items on hard levels is a complete nightmare.

Cons
- Bad voice acting, no really, its bad
- Seems to be a bit hateful towards people of non hereto sexuality especially, although sometimes it can be funny
- awful fucking dialog on behalf of everyone but Cory, omfg they put in a cut scene every 2 god damn seconds with the most atrocious fucking filter known to man kind, they also for some reason put in a dude screaming all the time
- Awful hit registration with some guns especially the LMG, I also tend to see some weapons have massive inconsistencies, one time a gun can be a sniper and the other time its like the bullets are allergic to the target 
- The dumb fucking karma system, you cant receive karma for doing good tasks and bumping into an NPC reduces karma so have fun with the 'good run' achievement
- Repetitive, I seem to find only Postal 2 was able to nail the 'go do task then be attacked by violent mob' formula and make it genuinely fun, both postal 3 & 4 sometimes feel like its just too much of the same shit
- No jumping, a game made in source with no jumping??? The no jumping mechanic can make movement feel quite clunky at times
- Map, jeez the map, not only can you not see where you're going but load zones are most of the time out of the blue, not a mini map in sight either.
- Enemies, ""How to make a game challenging? hmmmm... spawn 600 enemies 5 metres from the player, that'll be cool""
- Fucking. Flinching. Most enemies have access to LMG's and AR's and god fucking damn it, the flinching you do when you're shot, it's... annoying to say the least. 

All that being said, let me give you some advice when playing:
- Saving still saves your EXACT progress so you can get right back into whatever you saved
- Under NO CIRCUMSTANCE (except when achieving the 'Emo' achievement) are you to press left mouse (the universal shoot button) when using the rocket launcher, idk if this was just for me but the rocket blows up in your face and most of the time results in an instakill, only use right fire button which is the heat seeking option.
- On the topic of the rocket launcher, with only being able to use the heat seeking option, the projectile will put any bosses out of priority and instead goes for normal hostile NPC's this is a good tip for the final boss fight that can only be stopped with the rocket launcher, kill all the ground men first, otherwise you're just wasting rockets.
- If you want that good run achievement then the taser is your best friend, run slow as to not hurt any innocents and DO NOT tase innocents, do not kick nor punch them either, this can be extremely difficult.
- I'm pretty sure the bi-polar achievement is impossible to you may have to get out ol' Sam to unlock this one.

All that being said. Not a good game, but, when taking into account this games production history, I learned to roll with the jank, and if you accept this game for the trash it truly is and don't take it too seriously, you may actually have a bit of fun.","Playing this game I didn't expect much, I basically only got it to complete my postal game collection. Everyone says this game is bad, and well, it is. But, I think RWS have actually gone and patched a lot of bugs throughout the game actually making it playable! Here i have made a list of pros and cons I experienced with the game:

Pros
- Humour can be funny at times
- Lots of interesting weapons and features we never got in any other postal games
- Mostly fun achievements 
- Not always a completely boring game, some missions I found to be quite fun in fact
- Better gore, nothing more satisfying than shooting an innocent bystanders face off
- Runs better than it did at og release, I experienced little crashes and little to no frame drops more than what can be said for postal 4
- Cory is a really good voice actor for postal dude and was probably the best part of this game character wise, not that there was any competition for that title in the postal series
- Regenerating health, say good bye to your crack and fast food because now you regenerate your health back, some people could see this as a pro or con but as much as I love the infamous 'Health pipe' gag in postal, being stuck without healing items on hard levels is a complete nightmare.

Cons
- Bad voice acting, no really, its bad
- Seems to be a bit hateful towards people of non hereto sexuality especially, although sometimes it can be funny
- awful fucking dialog on behalf of everyone but Cory, omfg they put in a cut scene every 2 god damn seconds with the most atrocious fucking filter known to man kind, they also for some reason put in a dude screaming all the time
- Awful hit registration with some guns especially the LMG, I also tend to see some weapons have massive inconsistencies, one time a gun can be a sniper and the other time its like the bullets are allergic to the target

2 года ожидания (мои) и потраченные 240 рублей оказались не зря потраченные

!!!СПОЙЛЕРЫ!!!

[h1] Геймплей [/h1]
Давайте не будем сравнивать с Postal 2, просто... Не хочется и ещё я забыл чо там да как там

Сам геймплей по началу кажется немножко скудный (сбор камшота и отбитие мамаш, сбор котов и отбитие чин чан чон и защита порно актрисы), но потом уж начинается интересно: даётся варианты выбора, влияющие на концовку: либо примкнуть к 50 благословениям, либо к ментам или тем и тем дать люлей (хотя если это сделаешь, то попадешь в 50 благословений). Можно отстреливать бошки у NPC, что окупает эти 240 рубчиков, кто бы мог подумать что есть система репутации, которая была нормально реализована в RDR 2 (есть в Watch_dogs, но она там плохо реализована). Вместо вида от 1 лица как обычно, оказалось вид от 3 лица, что кстати мое почтение! Пушек немного, но некоторые из них юзабельны, например кошачья мята (я только в конце понял как она работает), м16 с м249, коты (кто бы уж подумал), пистолет совсем чуть-чуть, мачете, шокер, дробовик, свой болт и т.д. т.п., вводный текст перед началом миссии сделаны довольно добротно, а катсцены... Сам купишь игру и поймёшь

[h1] Саундтрек [/h1]
О бо-же мой, это просто попец-копец в хорошем смысле, все тоже самое в начале скудный саундтрек, но потом прям блеан, ни в сказке сказать ни пером описать

[h1] Озвучка [/h1]
В английской озвучке чувака озвучивал Кори Круз, а в русском дубляже Кураж Бамбей (он же Денис Колесников). Если озвучка не была наложена на английскую озвучку, то было бы на 11/10, а так на 9/10

[h1] Сюжет [/h1]
[spoiler]Мне впадлу рассказывать, поэтому вставьте палец в жопу и покупай игру[/spoiler]

[h1] Итог [/h1]
Конечно фиксить игру, которую помнят лишь древние люди - банально, но все равно релиз ремастера трилогии ГТА и Postal 4 хуже чем это, моя оценка игре: 3 пожизненных/10

P.S. Некоторые достижения не хотят работать (либо это у меня такое, либо у кого-то другого)","[h1]""I took a shit 3 times and after 12 years I finally washed it off...""[/h1]

Two years of waiting (mine) and the 240 rubles I spent turned out to be well spent.

!!!SPOILERS!!!

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Let's not compare it to Postal 2, it's just... I don't want to, and I've forgotten what it's like there.

The gameplay itself seems a bit barebones at first (collecting cumshots and beating up mothers, collecting cats and beating up Chin Chan Chung and protecting a porn actress), but then it gets interesting: you're given choices that influence the ending: either join the 50 blessings, the cops, or give them both a beating (though if you do, you'll be in the 50 blessings). You can shoot off NPC heads, which makes the 240 rubles worth it. Who would have thought there was a reputation system, like the one implemented well in RDR2 (Watchdogs has one, but it's poorly implemented there). Instead of the usual first-person view, it's third-person, which, by the way, is a big plus! There aren't many guns, but some are usable, like catnip (I only figured out how it works at the end), the M16 and M249, cats (who would have thought), a very small pistol, a machete, a taser, a shotgun, your own bolt, etc. The introductory text before the mission starts is pretty well done, and the cutscenes... You'll buy the game and understand.

[h1] Soundtrack [/h1]
Oh my god, it's just fucking awesome, in a good way. It's the same old story at the beginning, the soundtrack is mediocre, but then it's just plain awful, you can't even describe it.

[h1] Voiceover [/h1]
In the English dub, the dude was voiced by Corey Cruz, and in the Russian dub, by Kurazh Bombay (aka Denis Kolesnikov). If the voiceover hadn't been overlaid on the English dub, it would have been an 11/10, but as it is, it's a 9/10.

[h1] Plot [/h1]
[spoiler]I'm too lazy to tell you, so stick your finger up your ass and buy the game [/spoiler]

[h1] Summary [/h1]
Of course, fixing a game that only ancient people remember is trivial, but the GTA trilogy remaster and Postal 4 releases are still worse than this. My rating for the game is 3 lifetimes/10.

P.S. Some achievements don't work (either it's me or someone else)."

148540320,russian,2023.09.20 17:32,✅,✅,0.540229857,5,"Постал 3 вышел 12 лет назад и за всё время впервые в неё поиграл. Причина была исключительно в том, что игру всё это время активно поливали дерьмом и с такой уверенностью, что в это верилось по-умолчанию.
Сейчас же игру вернули в Стим и любопытство взяло своё, игра пройдена и... в каком-то смысле для меня это игра года (читай ""открытие года""), потому что она не такое дерьмо.
Уже прошли годы, не могу судить о том, какой она была на релизе, так или иначе что-то правили в последующее время, но сейчас по техническому состоянию она вполне играбельная.
Наверное, можно понять тех, кто ждал её 12 лет назад и остался недоволен, потому что ждали её те, кто наверняка уже познакомился с первой и второй частью, которые были вызывающими, выёбывающими рамки приличия, сатирическими. К сожалению, делать легенду каждый раз мало кто может и Постал 3 очень отличается от прошлого опыта.
Если же эту игру воспринимать так, как ей подходит, а именно подпивасным развлечением на пару вечером с глупыми аля ситкомовскими шутками, то геймплей норм, озвучка сразу уместна и т.д. и т.п.
Не возлагайте на неё слишком больших надежд и она не разочарует. Это встреча на раз, сделали дело и разбежались, не более. По прошествии времени уже можно, думаю, снять с трёшки ответственность за то, что она не шедевральное продолжение шедевра.
Особенно за неё хочется заступиться из-за того, что не только фанаты кидают в игру какашки, но и RWS усиленно подвозит новые запасы метательного дерьма. Они стебались над тройкой в Потерянном раю, в Постал 4, вроде как нелестно отзывались о ней в соцсетях, даже на своём стриме недавно высказались по поводу неё в духе ""Ну мы в Стим вернули, ничего исправить не можем, примите её такой, какая есть"". То есть даже спустя годы есть какая-то обида, которая заставляет говорить в духе ""Если вы копрофилы, то тогда вот вам отличное говно"". И вроде всё ничего, но до Постал 3 мной пройден Постал 4. Дважды. В том числе и через полгода с релиза. И если уж Постал 3 херня, то пока всё равно никто не сделал номерной части серии лучше.

UPD с задержкой, на 14.10.2024
дорогой дневник, Postal 3 теперь пройден дважды на разные концовки, Postal 4 всё ещё лагуч и багуч с первых же шагов после запуска и трёшка всё ещё лучше
не путайте цифру при выборе)","Postal 3 came out 12 years ago, and this is the first time I've played it. The only reason was that the game was constantly being trashed, with such confidence that it was almost a given.
Now the game's back on Steam, curiosity has taken over, I've finished it, and... in a sense, for me, it's the game of the year (read: ""discovery of the year""), because it's not such a piece of crap.
Years have passed, so I can't judge what it was like at release; some things have been tweaked over time, but now, technically, it's quite playable.
I guess you can understand those who were waiting for it 12 years ago and were dissatisfied, because those waiting for it were likely already familiar with the first and second games, which were provocative, borderline-pushing, and satirical. Unfortunately, few can create a legend every time, and Postal 3 is very different from previous experiences. If you take this game for what it's worth—namely, a casual evening of drinking fun with some silly sitcom-esque jokes—then the gameplay is fine, the voice acting is immediately appropriate, and so on and so forth.
Don't get your hopes up too high, and you won't be disappointed. It's a one-time encounter, get the job done and then run away, nothing more. With the passage of time, I think we can absolve the 3rd party of responsibility for not being a masterpiece sequel to a masterpiece.
I especially want to defend it because not only are fans throwing crap at the game, but RWS is also busily delivering new supplies of throwable crap. They made fun of the 3rd party in Paradise Lost, in Postal 4, seemingly made unflattering comments about it on social media, and even recently commented on it on their stream along the lines of, ""Well, we returned it to Steam, we can't fix anything, take it for what it is."" So, even years later, there's a certain resentment that makes me say things like, ""If you're a coprophiliac, then here's some excellent crap for you."" And everything seems fine, but before Postal 3, I completed Postal 4. Twice. Including six months after its release. And if Postal 3 is crap, then no one has made a better numbered entry in the series yet.

UPDATE: Delayed, as of October 14, 2024
Dear diary, I've now completed Postal 3 twice, with different endings. Postal 4 is still laggy and buggy from the very first steps after launch, and Postal 3 is still better.
Don't confuse the numbers when choosing."

Такого фальшивого зачитывания текста с обоссаного мятого листочка вы не услышите за последние 20 лет НИГДЕ. Я дальше пролога просто не смог пройти из-за этого перевода. Ну какая же это ссанина е*аная, вы посмотрите!

Вспомните потрясающего Груздева во втором Постал: ""уууу, это должно быть... БОЛЬНАААА!""
В Кураже: ""ой, наверное больно""
И всё! Никаких эмоций нет в этом постал3.

Груздев в Постал 2 ме-длен-но и осуждающе говорит игроку, который убивает очередного нпс: ""я ЗНАЮ, что ты думаешь, но я... НИКОГДА НЕ ИГРАЛ... в видео игры...""
Кураж после первого НПС: ""язнаючтотыдумаешь,я никогданеигралввидео..""
Заткнись!!! Закрой ты рот свой! Боже! Где тут переключить язык? Мне плохо...

Лет 6 назад я дошел до города (это начало первой главы). В тот момент я играл на ноуте и не помню, что за характеристики там были. Но именно на постал 3 (!) в городе начались просадки до 5-15 фпс. Ну, подумал я, отложу игру на будущее. Негативных эмоций тогда не было вообще.
Примерно так я подумаю снова - отложу на будущее. Но теперь я добавлю фразу ""возможно, но вряд ли"". В будущем возможно запущу, но вряд ли.
Эта игра плохА во всем: в первой главе меня бросало в дрожь от кринжа, мне было плохо от обучающих подсказок (белый текст на черном фоне говорит тебе: используй доп-отаку чтоб гранату кинуть!!! А на какую кнопку доп-отака?!!!! - кричишь ты в игре. Ищи сам, пля - отвечает тебе игра), плохо от физики плаща, который тут почти с нулевой гравитацией, плохо от графона (послабление на дату выхода я сделал), плохо от звуков в принципе и плохо от завязки игры. Тот же юмор... Боже, что вы сделали с моим мальчиком... Это же не юмор, это просто конская залу... ухыхыхы, ну вы поняли, да? конская залу... ахауххухцхху
При втором запуске не осталось ни позитивных, ни нейтральных эмоций. Исключительно негатив.

Но лично мне! Больнее всего мне от озвучки. Даже если абстрагироваться от невероятного АКТЕРА Груздева Александра Рудольфовича (озвучил гг в Постал 2 и ОГРОМНОЕ количество других ролей)... Абстрагироваться от 2 части...
Во 2 части у тебя живой ГГ с эмоциями и чувствами! А в 3 части озвучка - дно. В третьей части тот же ГГ, но механический бесформенный писисОсец.

Не касайтесь этого дна. Всем Вам хорошего всего.","A voiceover by Kurazh Bombay?! Hahaha! It's a fucking NIGHTMARE. This voiceover is a disaster. It's a complete disaster. You won't hear such a fake reading of the text from a piss-stained, crumpled piece of paper ANYWHERE in the last 20 years. I simply couldn't get past the prologue because of this translation. What a fucking mess it is, just look at it!

Remember the amazing Gruzdev in the second Postal: ""Ooooh, that must be... PAINFUL!""
In Kurazh: ""Ouch, that must be painful.""
And that's it! There's no emotion in this postal. In Postal 2, Gruzdev slowly and disapprovingly tells a player who's killing another NPC: ""I KNOW what you're thinking, but I... NEVER PLAYED... a video game...""
Courage after the first NPC: ""I know what you're thinking, I've never played a video game...""
Shut up!!! Shut your mouth! Oh my God! Where can I change the language? I feel sick...

About six years ago, I reached the city (the beginning of the first chapter). At that point, I was playing on a laptop and don't remember what the stats were. But it was on Postal 3 (!) that the FPS in the city started dropping to 5-15. Well, I thought, I'll put the game aside for later. I had no negative emotions at all then.
I'll think about it again – I'll put it aside for later. But now I'll add the phrase ""possibly, but unlikely."" I might play it in the future, but unlikely. This game is bad in every way: the cringe in the first chapter made me shudder, the tutorial prompts made me sick (white text on a black background tells you: ""Use extra taka to throw a grenade!!! ""And which button do you press for extra taka?!!!!"" you yell in the game. ""Find it yourself, damn,"" the game tells you), the cloak physics, which have almost zero gravity, are bad, the graphics are bad (I made some concessions for the release date), the sounds in general are bad, and the game's premise is bad. The same humor... Oh my God, what have you done to my boy... This isn't humor, it's just a horse show... ugh, you get it, right? A horse show... ah-hah-hah-hah
After the second launch, I had no positive or neutral emotions left. Purely negative.

But for me personally! The voice acting is what really hurts me the most. Even if we ignore the incredible ACTOR, Alexander Rudolfovich Gruzdev (he voiced the main character in Postal 2 and a HUGE number of other roles)... Even if we ignore Part 2...
In Part 2, you have a living protagonist with emotions and feelings! But in Part 3, the voice acting is rock bottom. In Part 3, it's the same protagonist, but a mechanical, shapeless puss.

Don't touch that rock bottom. All the best to you all."

148277681,russian,2023.09.15 17:24,✅,✅,0.5923138857,9,"Как бы вы не оценивали эту игру по шкале от 1 до 10, по уровню гoвнистoсти всей игры естественно, не стоит отрицать то, что она будет куда целостнее и лучше, чем Postal 4.

Всё же достоинства этой части какие никакие но есть, нормальная графика, добротный геймплей, и хоть и очень нелепый и видно написанный русскими, зато интересный сюжет, качественная рисовка и анимации в катсценах и конечно же самые главные 2 аргумента в пользу этой части, это Axyeнный саундтрек и Нелинейность (Которая конечно своеобразная здесь и кривая, но ведь есть). 

Эту часть в основном хейтят иза Очень xepoвой оптимизации, дебильного ИИ, отвратительной постановки локаций, ужасной русской локализации (Кураж Бамбей вижу совсем не старался над озвучкой игры здесь), частых вылетов на рабочий стол, ломанных ачивок и прочего. И да, так оно и есть. 

Но это всё зато по цене примерно 2 шавермы если в фулл прайс (по цене на скидках сравнимо с пачкой сухариков), ведь тот же Postal 4, стоит уже 9 шаверм, а также куда хуже по тем аспектам, которые я перечислял выше. 

В общем Postal 3 - это пример недооценённого проекта, который пытался стать хитом русского игропрома в то время, но у него это не получилось, ибо тогда аудитория игр видимо, была другой и вкусы были такими, да и дал Хит русскому игропрому только в 23 году, когда вышел Atomic Heart, но это уже другая история. 

А так игре могу поставить 7/10, как никак, но получать удовольствие от игры можно, тем более с недавним патчем от Zoom Platform, в котором удалили неработающие ачивки, убрали этот eбaнный DRM, и даже дали всем абсолютно Fart Gun, который раньше был доступен только в России, и то, только если игру предзаказали, а так я даже не знаю что тут делать, рекомендовать игру или нет, но я считаю, что она достоина внимания, которого она к сожалению не получила тогда.","No matter how you rate this game on a scale of 1 to 10, and the overall crappiness of the game itself, there's no denying that it's far more cohesive and better than Postal 4.

Still, this game does have some merits: decent graphics, solid gameplay, and, while very awkward and clearly written in Russian, an interesting plot, high-quality art and animation in cutscenes, and of course, the two main arguments in its favor are the Axy soundtrack and nonlinearity (which is certainly unique and flawed, but it's there).

This game is mostly hated because of its extremely poor optimization, idiotic AI, terrible location design, terrible Russian localization (I see Kurazh Bombay didn't put any effort into the game's voice acting here), frequent crashes to desktop, broken achievements, and so on. And yes, that's how it is.

But all this costs about the same as two shawarmas at full price (on sale, it's comparable to a pack of crackers), while Postal 4 costs nine shawarmas, and is also far worse in all the aspects I mentioned above.

Overall, Postal 3 is an example of an underrated project that tried to become a hit in the Russian gaming industry at the time, but it failed because the gaming audience and tastes were apparently different back then. It only achieved a hit in 2023 with the release of Atomic Heart, but that's another story.

But overall, I'd give the game a 7/10. It's still enjoyable, especially with the recent Zoom Platform patch, which removed non-working achievements, removed that damn DRM, and even gave everyone Fart Gun, which was previously only available in Russia, and only if you pre-ordered the game. I don't even know what to do here, recommend the game or not, but I think it deserves the attention it unfortunately didn't get back then."

In that light, unfortunately, the original devs (not RWS) really botched the quality control of Postal 3.

Jednym z głównych problemów ""Postal 3"" jest słaba jakość wykonania. Grafika jest przestarzała i nieatrakcyjna, animacje postaci są sztywne i nieprzyjemne dla oka, a efekty dźwiękowe są niskiej jakości. To wszystko sprawia, że gra wygląda i brzmi jak produkcja sprzed kilkunastu lat.

Kolejnym problemem jest słaba fabuła i brak sensownej struktury. Wydarzenia w grze są chaotyczne i niezwiązane ze sobą, a dialogi są infantylne i pozbawione jakiejkolwiek wartości artystycznej. Brak spójności i logicznego rozwinięcia historii sprawia, że trudno się w nią zaangażować.

Mechanika gry również pozostawia wiele do życzenia. Sterowanie jest nieprecyzyjne i nieintuicyjne, a walka jest monotonna i nudna. Brak różnorodności w rozgrywce sprawia, że gra szybko staje się powtarzalna i nudna.

Dodatkowo, ""Postal 3"" jest pełna kontrowersyjnych i nieodpowiednich treści. Gra promuje przemoc, obsceniczność i brutalność, co może być nieodpowiednie dla wielu graczy.

Podsumowując, ""Postal 3"" to gra, która nie spełnia żadnych oczekiwań. Słaba jakość wykonania, brak sensownej fabuły, słaba mechanika gry i kontrowersyjne treści sprawiają, że jest to jedna z najgorszych gier w historii. Nie polecam tej gry nikomu, chyba że jesteś ciekawy, jak wygląda absolutne dno gier wideo.","""Postal 3"" is a controversial action game that has earned a reputation as one of the worst games ever made. My review of this game is very harsh and negative.

One of the main problems with ""Postal 3"" is the poor build quality. The graphics are outdated and unattractive, the character animations are stiff and unpleasant to the eye, and the sound effects are low-quality. All of this makes the game look and sound like a game from a decade ago.

Another problem is the weak plot and lack of a meaningful structure. The game's events are chaotic and disconnected, and the dialogue is childish and devoid of any artistic merit. The lack of coherence and logical progression of the story makes it difficult to engage with.

The game mechanics also leave much to be desired. The controls are imprecise and unintuitive, and the combat is monotonous and boring. The lack of gameplay variety quickly makes the game repetitive and boring.

Furthermore, ""Postal 3"" is full of controversial and inappropriate content. The game promotes violence, obscenity, and gore, which may be inappropriate for many players.

In summary, ""Postal 3"" is a game that falls short of expectations. Poor production quality, a lack of a coherent story, weak game mechanics, and controversial content make it one of the worst games ever made. I do not recommend this game to anyone unless you're curious about the absolute worst of video games."

Hra ukáže něco originálního a to že si můžete vybrat stranu jako poldy který dělá obyčejnou policejní práci až takovou nenormální , jeden den jste v chudinské části a řešíte zločiny a druhý den jdete na nosorožce co jede na cracku. Můžete hrát za maniaka co močí na nevinné lidi a následně je podpálí a klidně umlátí je k smrti lopatou což je snad původní poslání Postal 2 kde můžete být maniak nebo pacifista a přežít týden jako normální člověk.
Hru jsem koupil aby jsem všechny díly Postalu , očekával jsem to mnohem horší jen kvůli tomu co jsem to slyšel a dočetl jsem se o Postalu 3 , každý si na to musí udělat vlastní názor , ale hra má hate kvůli jejím chybám ale ty chyby jsou snad na tom to nejlepší

Klady
+ Mise jsou originální dle mého názoru
+ Docela dobře zpracované i když je to od TrashMasters a ne od naších milovaných RWS 
+ Zbraně někdy použitelné
+ Možnost zatýkat nevinné obyvatele jako polda

Zápory
- Někdy když hodíte granát tak hra spadne
- Nejde si obnovit dobrou reputaci pokud hrajete za dobráka

Hodnocení 8/10","I enjoyed this game a lot, the game has its flaws either some bugs or glitches, if it were fixed it would change the opinions on this game.
The game will show something original and that is that you can choose a side as a cop who does ordinary police work to an abnormal one, one day you are in a poor area and solve crimes and the next day you go to a rhinoceros who is on crack. You can play as a maniac who urinates on innocent people and then sets them on fire and calmly beats them to death with a shovel which is perhaps the original mission of Postal 2 where you can be a maniac or a pacifist and survive a week as a normal person.
I bought the game to play all the Postal games, I expected it to be much worse just because of what I heard and I read about Postal 3, everyone has to make up their own mind about it, but the game has hate because of its mistakes, but those mistakes are perhaps the best part

Pros
+ The missions are original in my opinion
+ Pretty well done even though it's from TrashMasters and not from our beloved RWS 
+ Weapons are sometimes usable
+ Possibility to arrest innocent residents as a cop

Cons
- Sometimes when you throw a grenade the game crashes
- You can't restore good reputation if you play as a good guy

Postal 3 was a bad game. Postal 3 can still be considered a bad game with it's toilet humor, lackluster AI, copy-paste missions along moving away from formula of FPS open world where you can enter every building and find some goodies. Back in the days the hate was deserved. I can understand why RWS would hate it, it's a stain on franchise's reputation. But it's been more than 10 years since it's release. RWS released a DLC for Postal 2 that was simply a giant middle finger towards Postal 3. Fourth part of the franchise grew from a protorype to a full game. An arena shooter spin-off from Hyperstrange was released. All of this should showcase franchise's redemption and resurrection. But hatred remained. It remained till people tasted ""full version"" of Postal 4. 

Game recieved some patches, but only for russian version of the game, so majority of players were left with a broken, unoptimized, unfinished and overall poorly made product. On November 21st 2022 players were unable to even launch the game due to DRM issue. Quote from RWS Twitter: [b]With Postal 3's DRM issues and overall sh!tt!ness of the game itself, the game is officially no longer being sold on Steam.[/b] However on October 14th 2023 game received a patch that fixes many issues that community was facing for a whole decade. Same tweet states that RWS didn't have control over game's Steam page, but what stopped them from gaining this control for the past decade is unknown. In 2020 source code of many Source games was leaked and rumors say that despite Trashmasters refusal to give RWS the source code of Postal 3, they still recieved it.

This is where I want to focus on the hypocrisy of the whole situation. Postal 4 is objectively a bleak shadow of Postal 2. The Cyber Den's interview with RWS leaders on YouTube got an interesting part where big man Vince Desi states that he likes the change. What is Postal franchise? An isometric shooter, a first person shooter in open world, a third person shooter with focus on linear storytelling, a movie, an arena shooter and a mobile top down shooter. All products bring something unique to the table, everything stands out and holds up on its own, except for Postal 4. It sinks more and more into the absurd, has the same humor, terrible mission design, non existing bizarre plot, empty open world, awful performance and the only good thing is vehicles. Postal has vehicles now, very funny @ssholes.

Instead of continuing to pretend P3 didn't happen and playing the same ""haha look Postal 3 bad"" joke, just accept that it exist, say it's a spin-off like Brain Damaged or something. There is no way that you are calling P3 bad when P4 exists in its current form when RWS has full control over development. On paper It's not hard to be better than Postal 3, but apparently it is.

Postal 3 has incredible soundtrack with such bangers as [b]A Fall To Break – Lost, Left, All Alone; Tokyo Rose - Goodbye Almond Eyes[/b] and [b]Hint Machine -  The Nearning Light[/b]. Great performance from [b]Corey Cruise[/b] as Postal dude. A morality system that gives option for [b]replayability[/b] since you get different missions and different endings. Subjectively funny [b]toilet humor[/b] throughout the entire experience. Unique weapons like bee grenade, badger saw and fart gun.

This game is a time capsule of a certain era and it's beautiful. Postal 3 might be a bad game, but it's not a bad Postal game, and definitely not the worst Postal game.","[h1] A decade later we start to cherish things, even if they were bad [/h1]

Postal 3 was a bad game. Postal 3 can still be considered a bad game with it's toilet humor, lackluster AI, copy-paste missions along moving away from formula of FPS open world where you can enter every building and find some goodies. Back in the days the hate was deserved. I can understand why RWS would hate it, it's a stain on franchise's reputation. But it's been more than 10 years since it's release. RWS released a DLC for Postal 2 that was simply a giant middle finger towards Postal 3. Fourth part of the franchise grew from a protorype to a full game. An arena shooter spin-off from Hyperstrange was released. All of this should showcase franchise's redemption and resurrection. But hatred remained. It remained till people tasted ""full version"" of Postal 4.

Геймплей вполне себе бодрый, местами даже весело хаотичный, как и положено настоящему Postal. Тут  хоть немного чувствуешь эту адскую безумность, хоть и всё как-то коряво и недоделано. Но, блин, хоть не такая помойка, где всё слили в жопу, как в четвертой.

The gameplay is quite lively, even joyfully chaotic in places, as befits a true Postal. You can at least feel that hellish madness a little bit, even if everything is a bit clumsy and unfinished. But damn, at least it's not a complete shambles, like in the fourth.
Basically, if you enjoy having a blast with total chaos around you, rather than completing boring quests, this is definitely your thing."

Prepare for a wild ride as you step into the surreal world of Postal 3, a video game that embraces chaos and absurdity with open arms. Published by Akella and Running With Scissors, Postal 3 ventures beyond the conventional boundaries of gaming, delivering a rollercoaster of laughter and mayhem. While it's not without its quirks, this unorthodox experience is a breath of fresh air for those seeking a break from the norm. With a quirky sense of humor and sandbox-style gameplay, Postal 3 offers a unique, unforgettable journey that leaves players wondering, ""What did I just play?""

Graphics and Art Style:
Postal 3 adopts a vibrant and cartoonish art style, which enhances the game's humorous undertones. The character designs are over-the-top and distinctive, making them memorable and instantly recognizable. The environments are surprisingly diverse, from the rundown streets of Paradise to bizarre settings like the amusement park and nuclear plant. While the graphics might not be cutting-edge, they perfectly complement the game's tongue-in-cheek vibe and immerse players in the zany universe it presents.

Gameplay:
One of Postal 3's greatest strengths is its open-world, sandbox-style gameplay that grants players freedom to tackle objectives in their unique way. Whether you want to go on a mad rampage or choose a more diplomatic approach, the game accommodates your choices, resulting in different outcomes and experiences. The sheer variety of weapons, from mundane to utterly absurd, provides endless amusement and keeps the gameplay fresh throughout.

The mission structure, while loosely connected, adds to the game's surreal charm. You'll find yourself completing a series of wacky errands that often veer off into comical tangents, like joining a marching band or working at an unconventional animal shelter. This unorthodox mission progression might not appeal to everyone, but for those with a taste for offbeat humor, it's a delight.

Story and Humor:
Postal 3 takes its narrative cues from a blend of dark comedy and satirical absurdism. The story follows the protagonist, the Postal Dude, through a sequence of bizarre misadventures in the fictional town of Paradise. While some plotlines feel disjointed and lack a cohesive thread, the unpredictable nature of the narrative serves to amplify the game's chaotic appeal.

What sets Postal 3 apart is its audacious humor. The game fearlessly tackles controversial topics with a mix of clever satire and slapstick comedy. It doesn't shy away from pushing boundaries, which may not resonate with everyone, but for those who appreciate a dose of dark comedy, Postal 3 is a gem. Be prepared for moments that will leave you laughing out loud while questioning your own sense of humor.

Sound and Voice Acting:
The audio design of Postal 3 deserves applause for enhancing the overall immersion in its peculiar world. The soundtrack varies from catchy and upbeat tunes to eerie atmospheric music that complements the game's changing moods. Voice acting, while not always Oscar-worthy, suits the characters' eccentricities and brings them to life in all their quirky glory.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, Postal 3 is a rollercoaster ride of irreverent humor, bizarre antics, and an unapologetically chaotic experience. While not without its flaws, the game's charm lies in its willingness to push the envelope and entertain through sheer absurdity. If you're seeking a break from conventional gaming and have a penchant for dark comedy, Postal 3 is a carnival of mayhem worth exploring. Embrace the insanity and embark on a journey that'll keep you entertained, confused, and laughing all the way!","Introduction:

C'è più di un motivo per cui è il peggior Postal, quindi ecco alcune problematiche tra tutte quelle che ho incontrato io:

-All'avvio veniva chiesto di inserire un codice seriale. Non capendo ho cercato cosa dovessi inserire ma il sito ufficiale per le FaQ non funziona. Alla fine ho dovuto scaricare una patch per far partire il ""gioco"" senza dover inserire nulla
-La telecamera fa venire la nausea quando si corre
-Nemici sparano anche se si è al riparo (colpendoti comunque)
-Fare un grab ad un nemico stordito fa crashare
-L'audio di tutte le armi nelle sparatorie si sovrappone 
-Non si può saltare 
-Quest noiose, ripetitive e inutilmente lunghe
-Assolutamente zero freeroaming. In più le zone della mappa vengono riciclate a rotazione durante le varie quest
-IA che si incastra con gli oggetti o si perde per la mappa
-Il ""gioco"" salva SOLO ad inizio di ogni quest quindi se si perde si fa tutta la quest da capo
-Il pacing della storia è incredibilmente veloce (finisci una quest, parte la cutscene che introduce un'altra quest e così via fino alla fine del gioco. Non c'è un secondo libero tra una missione e l'altra)


Rest In Piss Postal 3","2/10
There's more than one reason why it's the worst Postal, so here are some of the issues I've encountered:

-At startup, it asked for a serial number. I didn't understand what I was supposed to enter, but the official FAQ site doesn't work. I ended up having to download a patch to start the ""game"" without having to enter anything.
-The camera makes you nauseous when running.
-Enemies shoot even if you're behind cover (and still hit you).
-Grabbing a stunned enemy causes the game to crash.
-The audio from all weapons overlaps during gunfights.
-You can't skip.
-Quests are boring, repetitive, and unnecessarily long.
-Absolutely no freeroaming. Additionally, map areas are rotated throughout the various quests.
-AI gets stuck on objects or gets lost on the map.
-The ""game"" saves ONLY at the start of each quest, so if you lose, you have to start the whole quest over again.
-The story pacing is incredibly fast (you finish a quest, a cutscene starts, introducing another quest, and so on until the end of the game. There's not a spare second between missions).

This game is one of TWO ever to make me want to vomit just playing it, and I can play fast movement parkour VR games. The only other game was Hunt Down The Freeman by the way.

And the amount of time I put into it was absoloutely not worth it. 

Even WITH that, within 12 hours of playtime I had 32 crash logs, and some of the crashes didn't even cause logs to appear.

To even get the game to WORK on modern systems, even with just vanilla, you must go out of your way to funny websites to generate an activation key, because the key included with the original purchase, ISN'T THE ACTIVATION KEY??? Just...just don't.

To even get the game to WORK on modern systems, even with just vanilla, you must go out of your way to funny websites to generate an activation key, because the key included with the original purchase, ISN'T THE ACTIVATION KEY??? Just...just don't.

EDIT: Since I've wrote this review, the game is back up on Steam without the garbage DRM! I still wouldn't recommend playing it unless you have a touch of the POSTAL 'tism, but I felt like I should mention the game does at least run now with some critical bug fixes, but you'll still want the camera mod."

Nie ma co oszukiwać, że Postal III nie spełnia moich oczekiwań jeśli chodzi o tą produkcję. Mimo że o grze było głośno w swoim czasie I przykuwała uwagę przez to, żeby była kojarzona z Postal 2. Myślę że gra była tworzona przez Running With Scissors byłaby lepiej odebrana.

Ale wracając do gry. Wcielamy się w kolesia po apokaliptycznym zakończeniu paradise Lost w postal 2 i przenosimy się do miasteczka Catharsis. I tylko od nas zależy jak ta rozgrywka będzie wyglądać. (W teorii tak to miało wyglądać)

Ale…

Rozgrywka jest dość uciążliwa, poprzez mechanikę gry jak i irytujące błędy których doświadczymy niemalże od samego początku. Walka wręcz to katusze, ciężko trafić w kogokolwiek a z dostępem do broni będziemy korzystać może z 2 3 sztuk reszta jest bezużyteczna.

Grafika bardzo słaba na tak reklamującą się produkcje. Niestety gra pozostawia wiele do życzenia. Niestety nie polecam.

[code] Review by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/maxiisteam/] Maxi [/url][/code]
There's no denying that Postal III didn't meet my expectations for this game. Although the game was widely talked about at the time and attracted attention by being associated with Postal 2, I think it would have been better received if it had been developed by Running With Scissors.

But back to the game. We play as a guy after the apocalyptic ending of Paradise Lost in Postal 2 and are transported to the town of Catharsis. And it's up to us how the gameplay will unfold. (In theory, that's how it was supposed to be.)

But...

The gameplay is quite tedious, due to the game mechanics and the irritating bugs we experience almost from the very beginning. Hand-to-hand combat is torture; it's hard to hit anyone, and with access to weapons, you'll only be able to use two or three of them; the rest are useless.

The graphics are very poor for a game with such a high profile. Unfortunately, the game leaves much to be desired. I don't recommend it.

Rating: ★★★★☆

Postal 3, developed by Running with Scissors, is an unapologetically over-the-top and irreverent game that dares to explore the boundaries of comedic absurdity. While it may not be for everyone, if you have a dark sense of humor and enjoy a healthy dose of satire, this game is an absolute blast.

One of the standout features of Postal 3 is its relentless commitment to pushing the envelope. It takes the concept of political incorrectness to new heights, satirizing society and its various taboos. The game throws caution to the wind and isn't afraid to make fun of anyone and anything, resulting in some truly outrageous and hilarious moments. It's a refreshing departure from the safe and sanitized approach of many mainstream games.

The gameplay mechanics in Postal 3 are solid, offering a mix of open-world exploration, mission-based objectives, and sandbox-style chaos. You can choose to play through the game's story, which is a wild ride filled with unexpected twists and turns, or simply engage in mayhem throughout the city. The vast array of weapons and tools at your disposal adds to the sheer fun of wreaking havoc in creative and imaginative ways.

Visually, Postal 3 delivers a gritty and immersive experience. The environments are detailed and filled with plenty of interactive elements, allowing for spontaneous and unpredictable gameplay moments. The character models are well-designed, capturing the essence of the game's outrageous nature. The sound design is equally impressive, with voice acting that perfectly complements the game's irreverent tone.

While Postal 3's humor and gameplay are its major strengths, it's important to note that this game is not for everyone. Its controversial themes and dark humor may offend some players, and the satirical nature can be seen as a double-edged sword. However, if you approach the game with an open mind and a willingness to embrace its absurdity, you'll find a unique and memorable experience.

In conclusion, Postal 3 is a game that pushes boundaries and challenges societal norms, offering an outrageous and satirical adventure. With solid gameplay mechanics, a visually immersive world, and a commitment to dark humor, Running with Scissors has created a game that stands out from the crowd. If you're a fan of irreverent humor and enjoy games that aren't afraid to be controversial, Postal 3 is a must-play

If you want to play a Postal game, you're better off just sticking with 1/Redux, 2 and the Paradise Lost DLC (which retcons 3 into a coma-induced nightmare), 4: No Regerts, and Brain Damaged instead, and there are much better third person shooters out there."

There are a couple reasons why you would buy this game, and almost all of them are mod-related.

- UltraPatch / AngelPatch - This one's the most important - makes this game playable (in it's current state, as a linear title) and even more modifiable. There are several, competing (for some reason) overhaul / remake mods out there for this game, and I am almost certain all of them rely on AngelScript in some capacity. Pretty sure a lot of this was made alongside, and to service, Catharsis Reborn. Not only that, but they've added multiplayer already. AND IT SEEMS LIKE NEXT UPDATE WILL HAVE A FULLY ANIMATED FIRST PERSON MODE. Kizoky doesn't even know who I am, but I am Kizoky's biggest fan.

- Postal 3 Redux and Postal Source - I'm not sure, entirely, how I feel about these guys. On one hand, they have brought back integral features, such as inventory (Let's go health pipe), have broke new ground on custom mission-scripts and have promised to keep their story / setting relatively similar to the release title. However, every new update seems more scattered, the Postal 3 team, with their unmatched level of talent, seem to be focused on adding unneeded features, such as variants of the health-pipe based on real-world substances (rather than the silly, parody ones in the Postal mythos), and a full car-driving system for Postal Source. This seems to be the bane of every mod team, scope-creep and unneeded additions. At least these guys are staying similar to the glamorous, comedy-focused vibe of Postal 3.

- Catharsis Reborn - Every other year this mod seems flip-flop on whether it's a dead mod or not. The developers have to remind the fans non-stop that it's still in work, which is reasonable as what this team has decided to do takes a substantial amount of effort, comparatively, to it's competitors. They aim to make a completely different Postal 3, with a new story and a whole new set of cut mechanics that deserve to be in Postal 3. What's even more impressive is how focused these guys are on NOT adding unneeded code and features, as far as gameplay goes, these guys are pure. Problems start to arise when you consider the narrative direction of this mod. If you ask me, Postal 3's story isn't completely terrible, it's its presentation that is. Some of these jokes are incredibly on-brand, but the mission-structure of nightmares and lack of time to explain itself is it's demise. Some of the public-release story information (such as it's cutscenes) make this mod seem more doomed from a story-telling and atmospheric level than the game it aims to repair. If I had any advice for this team, it's that what you are doing for the engine is extremely impressive, you guys are some of the most organized modders in the world - even more than Black Designer in some capacity - don't let your narrative ambitions swallow your project alive.

- Finally, it's that the Production Quality, not the Game Development Quality, for this game is really good. RWS wasn't lying when they said they put a lot of money into this title, this was supposed to be their ""big game"". There is a lot of things that you will not see in this game that RWS put a lot of effort into, simply because there was no time or money to implement it. Postal 4 is a terrible narrative with a great front-end and gameplay. Postal 3, in a world where the game was good and it had the platform to express itself in full, had an alright story - in some regards it was more cohesive than Postal 2, but, once again, it has no ability to express that story to us, as it just simply needed to be done.

TL;DR - This game will finally be good in like 2030, whenever the mod community stops competing and decides it's more productive to work together to get a better minimum-viable-product out.","Public outcry to support the mod community to this game.

Зато предзаказал четвёртую и дождался её выхода из раннего доступа, и знаете что? После пары часов в неё я всё же решился купить ключ Postal III, сразу же установив на неё патч из свежего руководства. [b] И меня тут же затянуло [/b]. 

Во-первых, крутое главное меню, моментально задающее тон. И хотя с обзоров на ютубе мне довольно убедительно внушили, что кат-сцены и озвучка у игры кринжовые, в самой же игре я напротив получал от них истинное удовольствие! Во время прохождения я то и дело не мог понять, как на том или ином моменте у обзорщиков могли возникнуть сколь-либо значимые проблемы. Сам я лишь дважды застревал во время прохождения: Шлемосос отказывался бежать по маршруту (Совет: просто давайте ему подбегать ко всем дверям и дверным проёмам первым) и на охране границы, но там я просто хотел выполнить задание на ""отлично"", что необязательно. Да, случались вылеты, зачастую из-за попыток что-либо метнуть, хотя в некоторых эпизодах игра это позволяла. Из-за огромной оригинальности Postal 2 в плане вооружения довольно сложно придумать новые механики, но они тут есть, и ими интересно пользоваться, один только барсук-бензопила чего стоит! И да, в отличие от Postal 2 и 4 тут удобно переключать предметы. 

Итог: мне искренне жаль разработчиков, чьи старания остались не восприняты из-за технических огрех. Ведь в плане дизайна, музыки, механик, да и геймплея в целом игра очень даже хороша. Читая финальные титры и артбук я правда верю, что они хотели создать стоящую игру и не подвести ожидания фанатов! Эта была достойная попытка российского геймдева, которая, к сожалению, не была доведена до ума.","After hearing so many negative reviews about the third game, I didn't buy it on Steam while I could. But I pre-ordered the fourth and waited for it to leave Early Access, and guess what? After a couple of hours of playing, I finally decided to buy a key for Postal III, immediately installing the patch from the latest guide. [b] And I was instantly hooked. [/b]

Firstly, the cool main menu sets the tone immediately. And although YouTube reviews had pretty convincingly convinced me that the cutscenes and voice acting were cringeworthy, I actually really enjoyed them in the game itself! Throughout the game, I constantly couldn't understand how the reviewers could have had any significant issues at any given moment. I only got stuck twice during my playthrough: Helmet Sucker refused to run along the route (Tip: just let him run to all doors and doorways first) and while guarding the border, but I just wanted to get a perfect score there, which isn't necessary. Yes, there were crashes, often due to attempts to throw things, even though the game allowed it in some episodes. Because Postal 2 is so unique in terms of weapons, it's quite difficult to come up with new mechanics, but they are here, and they're fun to use—the badger chainsaw alone is worth it! And yes, unlike Postal 2 and 4, it's easy to switch items here.

Bottom line: I sincerely feel sorry for the developers whose efforts were wasted due to technical flaws. After all, the game is very good in terms of design, music, mechanics, and overall gameplay. Reading the end credits and artbook, I truly believe they wanted to create a worthwhile game and live up to the fans' expectations! This was a worthy attempt by Russian game development, which, unfortunately, was not brought to fruition."

While Postal 2 was criticized for its tasteless content, it still managed to be a fun and entertaining game. Unfortunately, Postal 3 falls short in almost every aspect.

The game's storyline is disjointed and lacks any meaningful direction. The humor is forced and often falls flat, relying heavily on shock value and cheap jokes. The graphics are mediocre at best, with poor textures and low-quality character models that make the game feel outdated and unpolished.

The gameplay in Postal 3 is also a significant letdown. The controls are clunky and unresponsive, making it difficult to aim and shoot accurately. The game also lacks any real challenge, with enemies that are easily dispatched and little variety in weapons or tactics.

One of the most frustrating aspects of the game is the frequent bugs and glitches. The game often freezes, crashes, or becomes unplayable, requiring the player to restart from the last checkpoint. These issues make it difficult to enjoy the game and often result in a frustrating and tedious experience.

O jogo começa na ponte que se dá a conclusão do postal 2 e referencia muita coisa ao longo dele, o humor é extremamente característico e a violência exacerbada continua presente; não é a melhor sequência que um jogo pode ter, muito menos o melhor jogo que alguém vai jogar na vida, mas é minimamente jogável e relativamente curto então mesmo limitado não fica enjoativo, além de você poder escolher o caminho pacifista ao invés de agradar o diabo no jeitinho postal de ser. Pra quem gosta da série, vale muito a pena

Considerações finais:
Se vc quer um jogo FODA, o conselho vai de acordo com o próprio protagonista: as físicas do GTA são melhores
Se vc quer um POSTAL, pode jogar sem medo de ser feliz ou se traumatizar com uma mecânica de terceira pessoa que te faz querer ser atropelado por um rinoceronte irl (se algum dia voltar pra steam, ou em outra plataforma)

E caso eu estiver errado, eu culpo o metal cristão, o bob esponja, a mídia tradicional, e também a outra mídia","What a fucking underrated game!

The game begins at the bridge that marks the conclusion of Postal 2 and references a lot throughout. The humor is extremely distinctive, and the over-the-top violence is still present. It's not the best sequel a game can have, much less the best game anyone will ever play, but it's minimally playable and relatively short, so even though it's limited, it doesn't get boring. Plus, you can choose the pacifist path instead of pleasing the devil in the Postal way. For those who enjoy the series, it's definitely worth it.

Final thoughts:
If you want a BAD game, the advice is according to the protagonist himself: GTA's physics are better.
If you want a POSTAL, you can play without fear of being happy or traumatized by a third-person mechanic that makes you want to be run over by a rhino irl (if it ever returns to Steam, or another platform).

And if I'm wrong, I blame Christian metal, SpongeBob SquarePants, traditional media, and other media as well."

実はメニュー画面だけ日本語化されている。

実際にプレイしてみると主人公が大きく画面に表示されているせいで見づらいカメラがまず気になる。
同じ理由で照準が付けられているかよくわからず弾が当たっているかどうかもまたよくわからないというTPSでありがちな欠点がしっかり出ているのが嫌になる。
キャラの動きももっさりしていて爽快感の欠片もない普通にプレイしていて苦痛を感じるレベルの古臭い低品質TPSである。
発売後10年以上経ってからプレイしているので古臭く感じるのも当然ではあると思うが、今更プレイする事はお勧めしない。

こういうゲーム自体の欠点もあるが最大の問題は2022/12現在ゲームの[url=activate.actcontrol.net] アクティベーションサーバ [/url]がダウンしていてそのままではプレイできない事である。
Steam版をプレイするにはどこからかNoDRMパッチを探してきて適用するしかないのだ。

これは販売停止になるのも納得である。

なおクソゲーにありがちな話だが音楽やゲーム本編以外のタイトル画面、コミック風のイラストなどの美術面だけは良いと思う。","This inappropriate TPS is notoriously considered an outcast by RWS, the developers of the other games in the Postal series.

In fact, only the menu screen is localized in Japanese.

When you actually play it, the first thing that stands out is the camera, which is difficult to see because the main character is displayed large on the screen.

For the same reason, it's hard to tell if your aim is correct, and it's also hard to tell if your bullets are hitting your target, which is a common flaw in TPS games that's annoying.

The character movements are sluggish, and there's not a trace of exhilaration in the slightest, making it an old-fashioned, low-quality TPS that's painful to play.

It's been over 10 years since its release, so it's only natural that it feels old-fashioned, but I don't recommend playing it now.

The game itself has its own flaws, but the biggest problem is that as of December 2022, the game's [url=activate.actcontrol.net] activation server [/url] is down, making it unplayable as is.

The only way to play the Steam version is to find and apply a NoDRM patch from somewhere.

It's no wonder that it's been taken off the market.

Although this is common with crappy games, I think the art aspects, such as the music, the title screen, and comic-style illustrations outside of the main game, are good."

Игра не хорошая, но и не такое г*вно, как многие считают. Да, в ней много ужасных моментов, ИИ, оптимизация, разрыв звука, фризы и лаги, и вылеты (был один раз, во время второго прохождения), но игра не на сколько ужасна. Я был мнения, как и все, что Postal III полное г*вно, смотря обзоры других, но поиграв я понял что игра мне даже больше понравилась, чем Postal 2. Ну, давайте по чесноку, объективно на 2022 год, Postal 2 скучная поделка, где нада бегать на большие расстояния. Нет, я не хочу сказать что Postal III лучше, просто мне Postal 2 не так сильно понравилась. Да, и, если посмотреть на современные игры, то на их фоне Postal III даже лучше. Не понимаю, почему RWS мусолят одну и ту же фазу что ""Postal III г*вно"" уже на протяжении 11 ЛЕТ, почему уже нельзя успокоиться, учитывая что даже игру из магазина убрали. На выходе Postal 4 имела проблемы и по хуже, чем в Postal III, да и кислотно-яркие цвета режут глаза. Понимаю что за такое мнение меня могут засрать, но, мне п0х*й :)
Прощай Чувак из Postal III, мы тебя не забудем
R.I.P 2011-2022","Well, I had enough energy to replay Postal III. The first playthrough was neutral, and the second one was bad, but I don't have the nerve to play it well. The game isn't good, but it's not as crap as many people think. Yes, it has a lot of terrible moments, like the AI, optimization, sound breaks, freezes and lags, and crashes (it happened once during the second playthrough), but the game isn't that terrible. I was, like everyone else, of the opinion that Postal III was complete crap, looking at other people's reviews, but after playing it, I realized I even liked it more than Postal 2. Well, let's be honest, objectively speaking, in 2022, Postal 2 is a boring game where you have to run long distances. No, I'm not saying Postal III is better, I just didn't like Postal 2 as much. And, if you look at modern games, Postal III is even better compared to them. I don't understand why RWS has been harping on the same ""Postal III is crap"" refrain for 11 YEARS now? Why can't they calm down, considering they even pulled the game from the store? Postal 4 had even worse problems than Postal III, and the garish, bright colors are just too harsh. I understand I might get trashed for this opinion, but I don't give a shit :)

The characters and actual plot - very badly written South Park episode. But at least Postal Dude VO tried his best in this one.
As for the gameplay - its tedious and completely broken in balance, enemies are either too many in numbers or bullet sponges.

Лично у меня к серии игр ""Постал"" особенные чувства.
На этих играх я рос, учил многие ""интересные"" слова и фразочки, учился знакомиться с людьми, и всегда ценил такие игры за то, что не боялись выходить за общепринятые рамки дозволенного, позволяя игроку не просто видеть, но и самому нести столь откровенное насилие. Эта игра была ""спасением"" от рутинной суеты, отлично расслабляла и успокаивала нервы. Не смотря на всю провальность самой игры, которая была допущена при её разработке, эта часть серии мне зашла, не полностью, разумеется.
Многие нелепые ситуации большенству игроков покажутся бредовыми и неуместными, но именно эта бредовость и неуместность как раз и веселила меня всю игру.

Как и говорил ранее - технические характеристики данной игры оставляют желать лучшего, и порой неплохо ломали игру.

Отдельное внимание стоит уделить озвучке игры, так как она вызывает приятные воспоминания о детстве, когда ты смотрел какой-нибудь боевик из семидесятых/восьмидесятых, да и сама концепция видеовставок открыто намекает нам на это.

Хоть ""Постал 3"" худшая часть серии по многим фронтам, она подарила мне приятные эмоции от её прохождения тогда, в ""те"" времена, сейчас, и будет дарить такие же эмоции в будущем.

Прощай, Чувак из третьей части, жаль, что многим ты пришёлся не по душе)","Well, another game has disappeared from the shelves of everyone's favorite store.
Personally, I have special feelings for the ""Postal"" series of games.
I grew up playing these games, learned many ""interesting"" words and phrases, learned how to meet people, and always appreciated them for their unafraid to push the boundaries of what was acceptable, allowing the player not only to witness but also to inflict such blatant violence. This game was a ""salvation"" from the daily grind, a wonderful way to relax and calm my nerves. Despite the failure of the game itself, which was allowed during its development, I enjoyed this installment of the series, not entirely, of course.
Many of the absurd situations will seem absurd and inappropriate to most players, but it was precisely this absurdity and inappropriateness that kept me entertained throughout the game.

As I said before, the technical characteristics of this game leave much to be desired, and at times they seriously broke the game.

The game's voice acting deserves special attention, as it evokes fond memories of childhood, watching some action movie from the 1970s or 1980s, and the very concept of the cutscenes clearly hints at this.

125531572,russian,2022.10.15 21:24,❌,❌,0.5,0,"Плюсы игры:
+ Графика выглядит неплохо
+ Бодрое и приятное на слух музыкальное сопровождение миссий (очень редко)
+ Смешные шутеечки (редко)
Спорный момент: много расчленёнки и крови — как в Hotline Miami. Не всем понравится.
Минусы:
- Необходимость установки патча no-DRM, чтобы игра банально запустилась. Иначе — добро пожаловать в активатор с ограничением в две активации игры
- Неадекватная сложность: либо противники стоят и не атакуют, либо на экране творится сущий ад и ВСЕ пытаются тебя пристрелить
- Никаких вариативности и приколюх из второй части: просто набор коридорных шутерных уровней
- Вместо сюжета — набор произвольных сцен с произвольными персонажами. Хочется спросить: это точно игра серии Postal?
- Бедное и скучное музыкальное сопровождение миссий.
Незначительные, по сравнению с предыдущими, недостатки: нерабочие игровые скрипты, которые уже никто никогда не исправит, механики ближнего боя и 99% видов оружия игры, которыми невозможно пользоваться, слишком сильно трясущаяся во время стрельбы и бега камера, и т.д.

Вердикт
Из того, что есть в третьем Постале, можно было сделать что-то весёлое и вменяемое по качеству, но вышло по-другому: игра попала в производственный ад, и бОльшую часть задуманного контента просто не добавили в конечный продукт, выпустив то, что успели сделать, как есть.
В итоге, при желании, Postal III пройти можно, но незачем, ведь есть куча более полезных и весёлых занятий. Не советую покупать никому.
Спасибо, что дочитал до конца!","Pros:
+ The graphics look good
+ The mission soundtrack is upbeat and pleasant to the ear (very rare)
+ Funny jokes (rare)
Controversial point: lots of dismemberment and blood—like in Hotline Miami. Not everyone will like it.
Cons:
- You need to install a no-DRM patch to even launch the game. Otherwise, you're stuck with an activator limited to two activations.
- Inappropriate difficulty: either enemies stand still and don't attack, or the screen is hell and EVERYONE is trying to shoot you.
- None of the variety and fun features of the second game: just a bunch of corridor shooter levels.
- Instead of a plot, there are a bunch of random scenes with random characters. I want to ask: is this really a Postal game?
- The mission soundtrack is poor and boring.
Minor flaws compared to the previous ones: broken game scripts that will never be fixed, melee mechanics and 99% of the game's weapons are unusable, the camera shakes excessively when shooting and running, etc.

Verdict
Postal III could have been made into something fun and decent in quality, but it turned out differently: the game fell into production hell, and most of the planned content was simply not added to the final product, releasing what was already there.
Ultimately, Postal III is playable if you want, but there's no reason to, as there are plenty of more useful and fun activities. I don't recommend it to anyone.
Thanks for reading to the end!"

Это игра моего детства и у меня небыло претензий (ну кроме непонятных для меня в то время отсылок и камео). А переиграв, осознал какая же это ужасная игра. Настолько ужасна, что и хороша(ну н4хуй). Что-то да и есть что манит меня. Например OST. Саундтрек просто хороша. Насколько ужасна игра, настолько хорош саунд. (Если в этом (тезисе) имеются ошибки, то это из-за того что мой мозг расплавился из-за игры). 

Плюсы:
+ OST
+ Разнообразие оружий
+ Комиксовые катсцены очень даже хороши и стилизованы под трешовые фильмы аля Фильмы категории Б
+ Арты оочень даже красиво нарисованы, не грех хотяб одну поставить на обои

Минусы:
- Сюжет
- Геймплей
- Не оптимизированный кусок говна, где в файлах можно найти фразы по типу ""Я хз что это за хрень но это мешает другой хрени так что отключим""
- Баланс оружий ((там просто пи3дец) можно конечно поправить в коде игры, но это уже слишком)
- Баги, баги никогда не фиксятся (их Д0ХЕРА, даже баггерпанк и баггерфол сосут по кол-ву багов на 1кв метр вместе взятых)
- Сегвей
- БАРСУКОПИЛА и КАНИСТРА(сами поймете)

Игра от меня получает 5 обкончанных салфеток из 10. (2 балла за OST)","Maybe I'm spoiled, but I don't regret the money I spent. This is the first Post-It title I've played from A to Z. It's a game from my childhood, and I had no complaints (except for the references and cameos that were unclear to me at the time). But after replaying it, I realized what a terrible game it is. So terrible that it's good (no fucking way). There are still some things that draw me in. For example, the OST. The soundtrack is simply amazing. The soundtrack is as good as the game is terrible. (If there are any errors in this (thesis), it's because my brain melted because of the game.)

Pros:
+ OST
+ Variety of weapons
+ The comic book cutscenes are very good and stylized like trashy B-movies
+ The art is very beautifully drawn, it wouldn't hurt to set at least one as your wallpaper

Cons:
- Plot
- Gameplay
- An unoptimized piece of crap, where in the files you can find phrases like ""I don't know what this crap is, but it interferes with other crap, so let's disable it""
- Weapon balance ((it's just a mess) you can fix it in the game code, but that's too much)
- Bugs, bugs are never fixed (there are a TON of them, even Baggerpunk and Baggerfall suck in terms of the number of bugs per square meter combined)
- Segway
- BADGERSAW and CANISTER (you'll understand)

The game gets a bad rap from me 5 shit-stained napkins out of 10. (2 points for the OST)"

Edit: Agora que o Jogo foi Removido da Plataforma, não tem mais como jogar, LITERALMENTE, apenas Pirateando, que pena porque eu iria comprar Denovo pra dar uma segunda chance, Agora só esperar pra ver se  RWS faz um sorteio ou providência o download dessa monstrosidade para nós.

ANALISE ANTIGA:

Não tem Motivos pro Jogo ser Vendido até hoje, Deixe eu Explicar:

Além dos Inúmeros bugs dentro do jogo, antes de você executar ele é necessário uma chave de ativação (DRM Basicamente) Mas até ai tá de boa, O único problema é que o site tá fora do ar, foi removido, então não tem como fazer a Inicialização do Jogo ( A não ser que você baixe uma Modificação para remover o DRM e poder jogar sem Código chave) O Único problema dessa Modificação é que ela pode crashar seu jogo, resumidamente não dá pra jogar, Além disso o jogo É Mal Otimizado, IA Horrível e Sistema de Níveis mal Feito (Sim, você não leu errado, esse jogo é baseado em níveis) Não vale a pena 24 reais, Comprei só pra Completar minha coleção de Postal, Mas o Jogo é tão horrível que acabei Reembolsando.","Edit 2: The game has returned to Steam, this time releasing the Zoom version, which is DRM-free and has fixed some bugs. I'd say it's at least playable now.

Edit: Now that the game has been removed from the platform, it's LITERALLY unplayable, only pirated. What a shame because I was going to buy it again to give it a second chance. Now we just have to wait and see if RWS holds a giveaway or arranges for us to download this monstrosity.

OLD ANALYSIS:

There's no reason for the game to be sold to this day. Let me explain:

Besides the numerous bugs within the game, before you can run it, you need an activation key (basically, DRM). But that's fine. The only problem is that the website is down, it was removed, so there's no way to launch the game (unless you download a mod to remove the DRM and be able to play without a key code). The only problem with this mod is that it can crash your game; in short, it's unplayable. Furthermore, the game is poorly optimized, has horrible AI, and a poorly designed level system (yes, you read that right, this game is level-based). It's not worth 24 reais. I bought it just to complete my Postal collection, but the game is so horrible that I ended up refunding it."

Since the release of the game, I knew that the game is considered a complete piece of crap. And buying it, I just wanted to collect a complete collection of games from the Postal series.
But the latest reviews, as well as the review of one of my comrades - that they advise you to reconsider your view of the game. Claiming that she's actually pretty good made me take my balls in my fist and go through her.
To my great regret - the game, as it was a piece of shit, so it remained.
I tried to ignore the toilet humor - not because it was nasty or I was embarrassed. No. I did not pay attention to him due to his absence. There is simply no humor in the game. And pathetic attempts to ridicule the most diverse situations only made them even more pathetic.
The game has moved from a first-person shooter to a third-person shooter. And of course, it played a terrible joke...  Because the controls are not optimized for this type. Get ready for the fact that you will not be able to hit the target with a pistol further than a few meters from the hero. Because the sight that is on the screen does not reflect the actual hit on the target. And this applies not only to ranged weapons - but also melee ones.
But you can get used to it. Even to the fact that a shot from a rifle tears the body in half, while from a machine gun you need to fire 200 bullets to put the enemy on the shoulder blades.
But you will have a great burn when you decide to choose a weapon - after all, the ammo in the game is not endless! And here we are met - a GREAT CHOICE OF WEAPONS! Yes, there are quite a lot of them in the game, but to streamline it - no one even thought about it. So spin the wheel! While you are being killed by a crowd of aggressive high school gamers with their mothers!
Remembering the absurd - but nevertheless funny tasks in Postal 2, I did not think that I would fall asleep from the most boring and monotonous tasks in Postal 3. Yes, there are a lot of them. And there are even several options for passing - both for ""good"" and ""evil"". Which has its own ""exclusive"" tasks. Therefore, in order to complete all the tasks - and get all the achievements, you will have to go through the game more than once - But how boring they are... And the constant deaths from the enemy with endless ammo - drive you into depression.

[b]In general, as a result[/b]: The game tried to continue the Postal series, but, like the film from Uwe Boll, it only profited from the loud title.

二代的Vince，Krotchy有出场，武器种类有点少而且携弹量过少。

24年1月补充：
Postal 3，堂堂复活！","This is the surviving child of the POSTAL series. Honestly, it's not as bad as I imagined. I heard the quality was inconsistent due to repeated changes in development teams, and because the new developers didn't know how to use Unreal, they had to use the Source engine. The optimization is poor, the running screen is severely juddery, the key layout is inappropriate, and the third-person perspective and linear storyline prevent P3 from inheriting the first-person open-world style of P2. The style is more Western-style.

Vince and Krotchy from the second generation appear, but the weapon variety is a bit limited, and the ammunition capacity is too small.

Overall, it failed to live up to RWS's efforts. It's certainly not good, but there's no chance of improvement, and there will never be another.

Сколько раз во второй части намекали: ""Не покупайте Postal 3"". Здесь ситуация двоякая на самом деле.

Движок Source - прекрасный выбор для игрового движка. Арсенал хоть и не такой богатый, как во второй части, но все же стрельба приятная. Новое оружие в виде пчелиного улья, барсука, пулемёта и т.д. В игре практически нет зомби. Здоровье теперь восстанавливается автоматически.
Ну и, конечно же, багованые достижения, 90% можно выполнить нормально или нестандартным способом. Если Вы хотите поиграть в это, то больше одного раза проходить вы вряд ли захотите. Лучше пройдите Paradise lost для второй части. Это отличная замена. Ещё неоднократные вылеты. 7 из 10.

14.10.23. КАРЛ ОНИ ЭТО СДЕЛАЛИ!!! POSTAL 3 BACK!!! 

Игра продолжает фикситься и далее.","[h2]The worst game in the series or a misunderstood genius?[/h2]

How many times in the second game was it hinted: ""Don't buy Postal 3?"" The situation here is actually twofold.

The Source engine is an excellent choice for a game engine. The arsenal, while not as extensive as in the second game, is still enjoyable. New weapons include a beehive, a badger, a machine gun, and so on. There are practically no zombies in the game. Health now regenerates automatically.
And, of course, there are buggy achievements; 90% can be achieved normally or in a non-standard way. If you want to play this, you probably won't want to play it more than once. Better yet, play Paradise Lost for the second game. It's an excellent replacement. Also, multiple crashes. 7 out of 10.

Playing the third game was incredibly painful, really. I started replaying it a second time and couldn't take it anymore. I'll play it again later. There are a lot of bugs and problems: with sound, textures, autosaving, achievements, and crashes. The game is very crude. But I can't help but notice Courage's excellent voice acting, the lackluster storyline, the cool jokes, and the Postal-style missions. The game is fun, I really enjoyed it, but it's quite difficult to play properly. So don't download it from Steam; download the pirated version.

Já jsem tohle koupil, jen abych viděl jak moc je to špatný, a jestli to lidi s tím hejtem nepřehání.
Nepřehání, ta hra je opravdu nestabilní a špatná.
Hra spadne snad každou možnou chvílí
Bugne se ovládání, takže Dude chodí jen do jednoho směru a vy s tím nic neuděláte, krom toho že to znova loadnete
Zabíjení zbraněmi na blízko nebo pěstmi vůbec nefunguje
AI nepřátel je rozbitý (Hlavně u toho nosorožce)
Jsou tam prohozené cutscény atd.

Jenom jediné věci které se povedli jsou:
Corey Cruise - který daboval Postal Duda, fakt Corey je perfektní alternativa
Hudba - Spousta písňí a soundtracků jsou úžasný.

A to je tak všechno, osobně nedoporučuji tenhle kus enormního zklamání, radši si kupte původní Postal hry a možná i 4, která je pravda rozbitá, ale aspoň že na ni RWS pracují a že to není tak hrozný jako 3.
Ale pokud fakt chcete vědět jaká ta hra je, podívejte se radši na Youtube a neplýtvejte na tadytom odpadu 12 euro.","Before I bought this, I saw a lot of videos about how bad this game is, the whole story about how much Akella and Trashmasters screwed it up, how on the RWS website if you click on the Postal 3 options in the games section, they Rickroll you, and more.
I bought this just to see how bad it is, and if people aren't overreacting to the hate.
They're not exaggerating, the game is really unstable and bad.
The game crashes at almost every possible moment
The controls are buggy, so Dude only walks in one direction and you can't do anything about it except reload it
Killing with melee weapons or fists doesn't work at all
The enemy AI is broken (Especially the rhino)
There are cut scenes, etc.
The only things that are good are:
Corey Cruise - who voiced Postal Dude, Corey is really a perfect alternative
Music - A lot of the songs and soundtracks are amazing.

And that's all, I personally don't recommend this piece of enormous disappointment, you'd better buy the original Postal game and maybe even 4, which is broken, but at least RWS is working on it and it's not as terrible as 3.
But if you really want to know what the game is like, you'd better watch Youtube and don't waste 12 euros on this garbage."

(P.S Третьей части никогда не выходило.) [/quote]

▷Именно такие слова содержаться в описании Postal 4 от Running With Scissors, авторов оригинальной дилогии, и именно они должны натолкнуть Вас на мысль о том, что игра Postal 3 мягко говоря не очень, но если Вы желаете узнать что-же плохого в ней, то читайте обзор дальше…

►И так, Postal 3 это настоящий долгострой, который волей случая и магии попал от оригинальных Running With Scissors к “нашим” разработчикам из Акеллы. Вы же все знаете, что Акелла делает только “лучшие игры” во вселенной, ведь так?

[quote=самореклама] Добавив меня в друзья, ты получаешь неплохой контент, сойдет обзоры и адекватного человека в ленте, это одно из лучших предложений на рынке.[/quote]

▷Postal 3 был анонсирован еще в 2008-2009 году, затем в 2011 году был показан кривой билд на Игромире, который потестили такие олды YouTube как Зулин и скатившийся с нуля на дно Мэддисон. И интересно то, что при игре на тестовом стенде игра у Зулина вылетела, в 2011 году, угадайте играя в 2022 пофиксили ли баг вылета? [spoiler] Конечно нет [/spoiler]

►Игра планировалась для Xbox 360 и на PS3 , да еще на UE, но по итогу из-за “нехватки денег”, хотя на самом деле из-за низкого скилла разработчиков, игру сделали на Source и то, только на PC.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2842038156

▷По итогу мы имеем кривой, вылетающий долгострой который не является каноном и который не признан оригинальными разработчиками, хотя в титрах указано, что они принимали участие в разработке [spoiler] Но думаю, их участие сведено к фразе “Какое дерьмо сделала Акелла” [/spoiler]

[h1] 🔵А есть за что хвалить ?🔵 [/h1]
►Да есть, как бы это не звучало, но в игре есть хорошие и даже “качественно” сделанные аспекты. Например озвучка от Кураж Бамбей, голос Шелдона, Кутрапали и других конечно ласкали ушки… Разнообразие оружия, тупого, кривого, но разнообразие же. Стилевые комиксы в кат-сценах. В двух моментах было смешно [spoiler] Но не исключаю тот момент, что мой мозг к тому времени превратился в кашу [/spoiler] Также в игре есть нелинейность, вплоть до разных миссий, да и три концовки на минуточку, которые зависят от кармы (Infamous ты ли это?). Ну и обилие всяких пасхалок и отсылок к современной культуре конечно же тут есть.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2835246556

[h1] 🔴А  ругать ?🔴 [/h1]
▷О ругать можно за множество факторов, ну давайте я выпишу только то, что бесило конкретно меня.
[olist]
    [*]Постоянные вылеты, частично лечится изменением скрипта, частично отключением всех кроме 1 монитора, а лучше все выключить и не играть в это
    [*]Кривое оружие, большинство никак не протестировано 
    [*]Кривая анимация и рваный сюжет, на уровне испанского стыда
[*]Очень маленькие локации, закрытые с постоянной подгрузкой и переходами
[*]Достижения, это полный ахтунг. Половина не считывается точно, а для второй требуется пройти игру 3-5 раз!!!
[*]Если кинуть гранату или какой нибудь другой объект игра в 70% случаев вылетает
[*]Проблемы со звуком, я часто ловил звуковые баги которые пережимали звук
[*]Отсутствие больше половины механик из основной игры и отличительных черт
[/olist]

[h1] Итог [/h1]

►Игра треш в чистом виде, это не стеб над повестками, это не сатира, это треш от трешмастер, это трижды переваренный кал. Игру конечно можно пройти, критических ошибок нет, но вот зачем? Лучше поиграйте Postal 2, поиграйте в дополнение “Штопор ЖЖот” с панк роком который вернет вас в 2007 год, даже это будет лучше. 
Пропускайте игру и не тратьте время и деньги.

Pros:

Badger Chainsaw
Vacuum
can still beat up moms
follows the story
can still piss on people
get to kill people on Segways

Cons:

Forced to 3rd person, its just weird, an option for first person wouldve been cool
You cant jump 
less gore
weird controls compared to postal 1 and 2

Graphics:

With my very mid pc i can run it at high at 120fps, they arent the best, feels like gta 4

Linux:

they dont have native linux support unlike postal 1 and 2 :(

Overall:

i enjoy it, but eh could be better 7/10

Si quieres una experiencia decente tienes que descargarte un mod aparte (hecho por la comunidad) para pasarlo medianamente bien. Eso si, tiene varias ideas que fueron usados para Postal 4 así que en algo aciertan con este juego.

It's well known that the Postal saga is too brutal, but the third installment is an exaggeration.

Also this game fixes my biggest issue with postal 2 which is headshot damage feeling nonexistent. headshots in this game feel great and the sound design for guns is amazing even if most of them are just ripped from valve games which already have those respective weapons.
And one last thing, this game's soundtrack is incredible, honestly one of the best game OSTs I've ever heard, even if you don't play this game, PLEASE listen to the soundtrack cause it's part of the reason I think this game actually isn't that terrible."

Радует только то что я взял её хотя бы не за фулл прайс, и что в ней есть хотя бы ачивки, иначе я б наверное вообще совершил бы суицыд. Начну с того что игра даже с запуска у меня начала лагать ещё не подгрущив даже меню, хотя у меня компудахтер не последнее ведро ещё. Благо я нашел в руководствах как через автоэкзек можно исправить фризы и лаги и она пошла аж на ультрах. Но это было только затишье перед бурей, далее я столкнулся не просто с неудобным управлением. А просто сука сука с наиуебищнещим управлением, поломанным звуком, геймплеем который наверное делали самые худшие из штата разработчиков Дарк соулсов, и самый не понятный и скучный сюжет с самым не понятным и не смешным юмором.

I did just that, thinking I'd give the game a chance and see if it's as bad as everyone says. Unfortunately, I never really got that deep. I'm glad I didn't buy it at full price and that it at least has achievements; otherwise, I probably would have committed suicide. Let me start by saying that the game started lagging right from the start, even before I'd loaded the menu, even though my computer is pretty good. Luckily, I found a guide on how to fix the freezes and lags using AutoExec, and it ran even at Ultra settings. But that was just the calm before the storm; later, I encountered more than just awkward controls. It's just a complete piece of crap with the most atrocious controls, broken sound, gameplay that was probably made by the worst Dark Souls developers, and the most incomprehensible and boring plot with the most incomprehensible and unfunny humor. This fucking game should be tortured, no less. Instead, buy Postal 2, the Paradise Lost expansion, go to Dota, do whatever you want, just don't buy or run this piece of crap.

O único ponto forte desse game é o modelo do Postal Dude, que é bem badass e mais bonito do que o do Postal 2 e 4, mas tirando isso, o jogo é uma verdadeira lástima.

2. game design porco, os mapas são podres e contra intuitivos, eu fiquei perdido algumas vezes, sem saber onde ir (talvez pq eu seja meio lerdo, mas tinha alguns lugares bem escondidos)

3. gameplay chata do caralho puta merda, a cada minuto tem uma cutscene, e quando ela acaba vc tem q fazer a MESMA COISA TODA FASE: atirar nos carinhas, as vezes escoltar algum npc BURRO PRA CARALHO e de vez em nunca tem uns negocios legais, tipo a ""bossfight"" com o rinoceronte e o helicóptero no começo do jogo

4. o jogo é muito mal otimizado, os gráficos nem são lá essas coisas mas mesmo assim o fps é instável demais, qualquer fase com bastante npcs atirando já fica com fps baixo.

não gostei do jogo... vou tentar platinar!","Okay, I finished the game and I'm going to point out some of its problems.

1. The controls are horrible. The wall-covering mechanic doesn't work because enemies can still shoot you most of the time. To jump, you have to take cover and press w... why? Was it so hard to do a single jump and hold the spacebar????

2. Poor game design, the maps are crappy and counterintuitive. I got lost a few times, not knowing where to go (maybe because I'm a bit slow, but there were some well-hidden places).

3. Boring gameplay, every minute there's a cutscene, and when it's over, you have to do the SAME THING EVERY STAGE: shoot the guys, sometimes escort some FUCKING DUMB NPC, and every now and then there's some cool stuff, like the boss fight with the rhino and the helicopter at the beginning of the game.

4. The game is very poorly optimized. The graphics aren't all that great, but even so, the FPS is incredibly unstable. Any level with a lot of NPCs shooting already has low FPS.

Like I said, this is probably the worst tutorial I have ever played. It teaches you a bunch of shit that doesn’t relate to the actual objective before telling you how to do what the arrow wants you to do. I also managed to break one of the triggers, softlocking myself 5 minutes into the game. This was also an issue I had a lot in Postal 4, constantly softlocking myself.

The visuals also suck and gameplay just feels ass, especially the movement which feels weird and cheap, if that makes any sense. It looks like they spent all their time on shitty unfunny jokes instead of on good gameplay and visuals, like they think dumb jokes is all that is needed for a good Postal game.

Also, what the fuck is up with those 8 bit background tracks, feels like I’m playing a handheld game from the 90s.

This game makes Duke Nukem Forever look like a good sequel. 

It feels nothing like Postal other than some of the humor and the Dude being the main character.

The game encourages non lethal gameplay while not having voice lines for it. (You will be saying guns don't kill people I do when your arresting someone by the book as a cop).

The game seems to lack any major game breaking bugs from what I played, but the games buggy. I passed the police tutorial stage but got the failed cutscene then continued down the police path for example, and a lot of the time sound effects and music don't stop during cutscenes when they are supposed to. 

The humor is there and alright I guess but not as funny as the rest of the series, and feels in many ways like a retread of the movie (The Dude wanders into the chaos, the Taliban, Uwe Boll being in a scene, etc.). 

The one redeeming factor is Corey Cruise as the Dude. He is a great Postal Dude and easily the next best thing to Rick Hunter, and honestly in some ways I may even prefer him to Rick Hunter. But now you can play as him in Postal 4 and Brain Damaged, or use the mod using his voice lines in Postal 2 so there is no reason to play this game to have his performance as the Dude, as great as it is. 

The game is also non canon in a way as it counts only as a dream sequence, so don't bother playing it for the Postal plot line. This isn't an issue though it's a good thing it got retconned out of existence. 

The level design is just all around poor, and boring.

The controls are awkward. 

The graphics use a lot of predefined Source Engine assets (Yes this runs on Source.) for example the Blood and much of the gunfire is straight from TF2. The white stuff in the Adult store section is the Scouts Mad Milk. I even think the Dude's piss might just be the Jarate sprayed in a different way. The audio is the same way, the gun fire and impact sounds are all from Half Life 2, making the game feel less than official. 

To be honest the way the in game voice lines were handled makes it feel like the Dude was just modded into the game, but that honestly is an insult to mods such as P3 Dude in Postal 2 and the Postal Dude Hatred mod that mod him into those games and do so great. 

Just a waste of money and more importantly time.","I Regret Everything

-Русский дубляж(можете сколько угодно говорить но всё таки давайте будем честны микрофон на котором был записан дубляж оно наихудшего качества даже для 2011 года,лучшим решением будет это голос в игре поставить на английский язык благо вам разрешают это сделать)
Итог:Я конечно понимаю,что щас налетят защитники нового состава RWS,но давайте будем честны новые части Postal что они делают это уже вторичные и низко-сортные проекты которые сделаны ради одной цели:это срубить бабла на таких фанатов,а вот Postal 3 изначально была игра с хорошей идеей то чего хотел Стив Уик ещё после разработки второй части,но RWS решили обратиться к Акелле и вот пошло поехало что-то пришлось вырезать,а что-то пришлось оставить и еле как доделать,но всё таки вышло,то что вышло,вот только есть одно но это,то что есть моды по Postal 3 такие как Catharsis Reborn или мод сделанный на движке второй части Postal 3 Unreal,а вот то что придумал Стив Уик это уже вряд ли увидим увы и ах тут.А вот новый состав RWS пускай идут нaxyй со своим Paradise Lost,Postal Redux и г.о.в.я.н.ы.м. Postal 4 No Regerts.Рекомендую ещё брать её по скидке я на новогодней распродаже брал за 79 рублей и был не разочарован такой ценой + сама игра не должна столько стоит сколько за неё предлагают.
Оценка: 5.5/10
P.S. ладно всё же Postal 3 полное гoвнo но всё же лучше чем никому ненужный и oбoсpaнный во аспектах Postal 4 No Regerts.","Despite the negative reviews, I still think Postal 3 is an average game, but by no means the worst in the series or g.o.v.n.o., as the young fans of the new RWS lineup believe. You can certainly enjoy the game if you install a fix or disable PHYSX to reduce the lag, as I've heard from many in the Postal community about this issue. Okay, let's move on to the good and bad aspects of the game. Pros:
+Nonlinear plot with multiple endings (there are only three, and they depend on your playstyle)
+Decent gameplay (the shooting is decent, and the third-person view doesn't detract from the enjoyment)
+Decent graphics for its time
+Diverse city of Catharsis (this city is, of course, no different from Paradise, but they still tried to at least add some variety to the structure)
+Short playthrough time (I played through the game on the good side the first time, and it only took me 3 hours)
The pros have ended, and now the cons are in order. Cons:
-Optimization (it's great that they used the Source engine for this game, but due to the careless programmers at Trashmasters, it will significantly reduce FPS, but as I already said, this problem can be solved)
-Russian dubbing (you can say all you want, but let's be honest: the microphone the dubbing was recorded on is of the worst quality, even for 2011. The best solution would be to set the in-game voiceover to English, since you're allowed to do so)
Bottom Line: I understand that defenders of the new RWS roster will pounce, but let's be honest: the new Postal games they're making are already derivative and low-quality projects made with one goal in mind: to make money off of such fans. Postal 3, on the other hand, was originally a game with a good idea, something Steve Wick wanted even after the development of the second part, but RWS decided to turn to Akella, and so it all started to roll: some things had to be cut, some had to be left in, and it barely worked. It's still a work in progress, but it still turned out to be what it is. There's just one thing: there are Postal 3 mods like Catharsis Reborn or a mod made using the Postal 3 Unreal engine from the second game. We're unlikely to see anything Steve Wick came up with, alas, here. As for the new RWS team, they can go fuck themselves with their Paradise Lost, Postal Redux, and their crap Postal 4 No Regerts. I also recommend getting it on sale; I got it for 79 rubles during the New Year's sale and wasn't disappointed with that price. Plus, the game itself shouldn't cost as much as they're asking.
Rating: 5.5/10
P.S. Okay, Postal 3 is complete crap, but it's still better than the useless and shit-covered Postal 4 No Regerts."

Think this game as Postal 3 but with bigger maps, plays better too, and has more or so the same gameplay (fix equipment, gather ammunition heal units etc). You can play as either the Germans or the Russians, in a series of scripted reenactments of real battles that took place. The meat and potatoes for me, is the dynamic campaign that this game offers. You play on a map with random battles, and while you play, you get to unlock units according your score of your previous battles. The game's variety of military personnel and equipment is close to that of Postal 3. You can chose your difficulty along with the campaign's length. Yes, the game has time management. It does not offer a tactical pause, but it can become so slow (almost bullet time) that will definitely give you all the time you need.
The best of all, is the ability to directly command a unit (from a single soldier to a tank) and play in 3rd - 1st person with which I had a lot of fun.Do expect the best graphics in the world, they are definitive. Corpses stay on the battlefield. Highly immersive.

GERAL---------------
Bem mediano e medíocre a comparar com o segundo game da franquia , contudo tem seu lado bom , mas ele ainda deixa a desejar quando você nota o quão o jogo vai ficando broxante e repetitivo . Apesar disso , eu tive momentos divertidos com o game, mas não o suficiente pra achar ele INCRIVEL no maximo legalzinho , o maior motivo para não recomendar , é que o 2 é melhor , mais barato , mais historia , mais DLC , mais divertido e a jogabilidade incrível , mas se fosse um jogo sem franquia , ou criado por fãs amadores ( afinal empresas gigantes fazendo merda não é aceitável não ) ele teria uma nota maior pela criatividade , mas a RWS fez muita coisa melhor .
Gráficos----------------------------------------------
sinceridade eu amei esses gráficos cartunescos , achei bonito , o design do Dude ficou bom , o cabelo , as botas , as calças e a cor menos EDGY da jaqueta deixou mais bonito o personagem , e o jogo no gráfico geral é bonito e teve um bom trabalhinho ali. Nota 7 (já vi melhores)
História------------------------------------------------
Parece uma piada de mal gosto , cuspido na cara dos fãs do P2 como se fosse merda , do nada o jogo te força a ser bonzinho ou a fazer boas ações (????????????????) POSTAL desde o 1 é pra matar e fazer merda , fazer final Jesus é algo opcional (é divertido) mas não crucial , e esse jogo a história é essa , dude tem que ser bonzinho para as coisas darem certo , eu fiz o final ruim porque por-favor Running With Scissors , ENFIE NA SUA BUNDA FINALZINHO BOM E VAI FAZER UM POSTAL DE VERDADE ( ja fez , pq postal 3 de verdade é o PARADISE LOST , ISSO É POSTAL 3 !!). enfim fiz o final ruim , resumo é que o dude morre e vai pro inferno e fim , tudo que vc fez n teve um final legal como o 2 , vc só foi pro inferno e fim , ainda bem que segundo a RWS o jogo é ruim mesmo e NÃO É CANÔNICO , pule direto do 1 , 2 , paradise , 4 e brain damaged para entender a saga postal completa , esse jogo no quesito historia é uma PIADA na cara dos fãs. Nota 0 (LIXO !).
Protagonista-----------------------------------------
aqui eu dou valor , eles ainda deixaram a  essência do humor negro , das falar carismáticas , do humor POSTAL , o jogo continua engraçado apesar de ruim , isso eu devo valorizar , pois me tirou boas risadas , isso sim é protagonista engraçado com falas fodas , meu único problema é a voz , a do Rick Hunter é melhor , achei uma bosta a voz , mas o protagonista é perfeito , não desisti de jogar por conta do personagem estar ÍNCRIVEL igual nos outros games POSTAL , espero que nos próximos ainda tenha essa essência fudidamente engraçada . Nota  8 (engraçado pra porra)
Jogabilidade ---------------------------------------
bem , ai chegamos em um ponto que me pega de surpresa , pois a jogabilidade terceira pessoa é um cu , o cara corre e a câmera fica com parkinson , o xixi n é mais botão próprio , agora é arma (????????) , mas a mecânica de cover é ótima , é divertida e útil , mas ai o jogo n te deixa pular (?????????????) é uma gameplay confusa perto do 2 , mas o tiroteio melhorou , diferente do 2 que o tiroteio é mediano , o tiroteio neste jogo está envolvente , mas ai eles FODERAM com uma pica de ferro o combate corpo a corpo  QUE PORRA DE COMBATE É ESSE CARALHO ???? 50 cacetetada no cara ele n morre , mas que porra , no dois era melhor . e o gore é 10 !!! o gore desse jogo é ótimo , tu pode desmembrar alguém VIOLENTAMENTE e usar o braço como arma , isso é ótimo , mas ainda assim O COMBATE A CORPO A CORPO É HORROROSO ! o tiroteio é bom , mas o corpo a corpo é uma vergonha comparado a do dois , puta que pariu. Nota 5 (é boa... mas podia ser BEM melhor...)
Física---------------------
assim , física de armas é ok , e de ragdolls é bem boa , nada de novo , mas de props.......... é horrorosa , lembro-me de empurrar uma cadeira pra frente e eu ir pra frente também , virou leis de newton 2? acho que essa parte eu pulei na escola , pq n me lembro de empurrar coisas e ser empurrado junto , achei horroroso , atirei um galão de água no chão e ele ficou de pé (LEIS DE NEWTON APROVAM ESTA PARTE DA ANÁLISE) , ou seja , física de props horrível , física do ragdoll normal e física de armas normal também. Nota 5 (podia ser melhor , vamos combinar , principalmente feito na Physx).
Comparativos ---------------------------------------
No 1 jogo tinhamos a visão de cima , no 2 melhorou em FPS ai eles tentaram inovar no 3 com TPS , e foi horrível, o jogo 2 é melhor em 8/10 aspectos do jogo , história , dublagem , atuação , combate , jogabilidade , fases , aventura e liberdade , P3 só é melhor que o 2 no aspecto gráfico e design , de resto não , ou seja , compre direto o 4 e pule essa merda ( eu devia ter feito isso).
NOTA FINAL : 5/10 jogo podre perto do anterior , faltou coisas , esse papinho de fazer bondade não cola em um jogo como postal , não criem franquias fodas pra depois trocar o objetivo delas , ninguém é idiota .
EXTRA : o jogo é ruim , mas se você puxa saco de jogos ruins que vem de empresas grandes , vc é um idolatra , seja justo , essa é uma análise imparcial e incorreta politicamente , a ideia é expressar a opinião de um fã de postal que zerou todo P2 e joga os clássicos postal também , se discorda , comente o por-quê , obrigado pela sua atenção e ignore a gramática merda.
                                                       5/10","*POSTAL 3* To analyze this game, we'll have to do it in parts |general analysis, graphics, story, protagonist, gameplay, physics and compare it to the previous one|.
OVERALL---------------
Pretty average and mediocre compared to the second game in the franchise, however, it has its good sides, but it still leaves something to be desired when you notice how the game becomes boring and repetitive. Despite that, I had fun moments with the game, but not enough to find it AMAZING at best, pretty cool. The biggest reason I don't recommend it is that the second one is better, cheaper, has more story, more DLC, is more fun and the gameplay is incredible. But if it were a game without a franchise, or created by amateur fans (after all, giant companies doing shit is not acceptable) it would have a higher score for creativity, but RWS did a lot better. Graphics----------------------------------------------
honestly, I loved these cartoonish graphics, I thought they were beautiful, the Dude's design was good, the hair, the boots, the pants and the less EDGY color of the jacket made the character more beautiful, and the game's graphics in general are beautiful and there was a good job done there. Rating 7 (I've seen better)
Story------------------------------------------------
It seems like a bad joke, spat in the face of P2 fans as if it were shit, out of nowhere the game forces you to be good or do good deeds (????????????????) POSTAL since 1 is to kill and do shit, doing the Jesus ending is something optional (it's fun) but not crucial, and this game's the story, dude has to be good for things to work out, I made the bad ending because please Running With Scissors, STICK THE GOOD ENDING UP YOUR ASS AND GO MAKE A REAL POSTAL (you already did, because the real postal 3 is PARADISE LOST, THIS IS POSTAL 3!!). anyway, I did the bad ending, in short, the guy dies and goes to hell and that's it, everything you did didn't have a good ending like 2, you just went to hell and that's it, thank goodness according to RWS the game is really bad and NOT CANONICAL, skip straight from 1, 2, paradise, 4 and brain damaged to understand the complete postal saga, this game in terms of story is a JOKE in the face of the fans. Rating 0 (TRASH!). Protagonist-----------------------------------------
Here I give value, they still left the essence of dark humor, of charismatic speeches, of POSTAL humor, the game is still funny despite being bad, I must value that, because it made me laugh a lot, that is a funny protagonist with awesome lines, my only problem is the voice, Rick Hunter's is better, I thought the voice was shit, but the protagonist is perfect, I didn't give up playing because the character is AMAZING like in the other POSTAL games, I hope that in the next ones it still has this fucking funny essence. Rating 8 (funny as fuck)
Gameplay ---------------------------------------
Well, here we come to a point that catches me by surprise, because the third-person gameplay is a pain in the ass, the guy runs and the camera gets Parkinson's, peeing is no longer a button, now it's a weapon (????????)), but the cover mechanic is great, it's fun and useful, but then the game doesn't let you jump (?????????????) It's a confusing gameplay compared to 2, but the shooting has improved, unlike 2 where the shooting is average, the shooting in this game is engaging, but then they FUCKED UP the melee combat with an iron pickaxe WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS COMBAT???? 50 beats the guy up and he doesn't die, but what the fuck, in 2 it was better. And the gore is a 10!!! The gore in this game is great. You can VIOLENTLY dismember someone and use their arm as a weapon. That's great, but THE MELEE COMBAT IS STILL HORRIBLE! The shooting is good, but the melee is a disgrace compared to the second one. Holy shit. 5 out of 5 (it's good... but it could be MUCH better...)
Physics--------------------
So, weapon physics is okay, and ragdoll physics is pretty good, nothing new, but the props... it's horrible. I remember pushing a chair forward and myself moving forward too. Is it like Newton's Laws 2? I think I skipped this part in school, because I don't remember pushing things and being pushed along, I thought it was horrible, I threw a gallon of water on the floor and it stayed standing (NEWTON'S LAWS APPROVE THIS PART OF THE ANALYSIS), in other words, horrible prop physics, normal ragdoll physics and normal weapon physics too. Grade 5 (it could be better, let's face it, especially done in Physx). Comparisons ---------------------------------------
In the first game we had the top-down view, in the second they improved in FPS, then they tried to innovate in the third with TPS, and it was horrible. The second game is better in 8/10 aspects of the game: story, voice acting, acting, combat, gameplay, levels, adventure and freedom. P3 is only better than the second in the graphics and design, otherwise not, in other words, buy the fourth straight away and skip this shit (I should have done that).
FINAL GRADE: 5/10, a rotten game compared to the previous one, it was missing things, this talk of doing good doesn't fly in a game like Postal, don't create awesome franchises and then change their objective, nobody is an idiot. EXTRA: the game is bad, but if you suck up to bad games that come from big companies, you're an idolater, be fair, this is an impartial and politically incorrect analysis, the idea is to express the opinion of a Postal fan who finished all of P2 and plays the Postal classics too, if you disagree, comment why, thank you for your attention and ignore the shitty grammar. 5/10"

Сюжетка нормальна, но иногда может показаться скучной.
Геймплей весёлый, но не настолько как постал 2, в постал 2 возможностей побольше как-то, здесь же мало оружий, маловато контента. достаточно интересный режим открытого мира, это самое лучшее в игре. Багов в игре почти не было, а сейчас они полностью отсутствуют.
А так - игра отличная.
Да и тем более если брать по скидке за 73 рубля, то это однозначно стоит того
7/10.","Postal 3 is a game that was so unfairly trashed that even the developers are complaining about it. It's definitely worth a place in the series. It's all down to the critics, who constantly ruin everyone's impressions of the games. The game isn't as bad as you might think.
The story is okay, but it can feel boring at times.
The gameplay is fun, but not as much as Postal 2. Postal 2 has more options, but there aren't many weapons and not enough content. The open-world mode is quite interesting; it's the best thing about the game. There were almost no bugs in the game before, and now they're completely absent.
Otherwise, the game is excellent.
And especially if you get it on sale for 73 rubles, it's definitely worth it.

E toda akela libertade que vc tinha no postal 2 aki n tem kkkk , Mas existem 2 finais  bom e ruim q vao depende do seu level de karma , Muitos itens foram cortados tbm tipo o cachimbo de cra.ck e coletes .

 combate melee e um lixo tbm  e sem contar com inumeros crashes q esse jogo tem kkkkk.

Mas se vc for com a mente desligada, O jogo fica até q interessante .

Nota : 6/10","The missions are really funny and creative, and this game's soundtrack is the best of all the postcards.

But there's no point in having good ideas if you don't know how to execute them. The combat in this game is terrible, the enemies are bullet sponges.

And all that freedom you had in Postal 2 is gone here, lol. But there are two endings, good and bad, which depend on your karma level. Many items were also cut, like the crack pipe and vests.

Melee combat is also garbage, not to mention the countless crashes this game has, lol.

But if you go in with your mind off things, the game is actually quite interesting.

Лагающее и багованное убожество.
Как фанат первых двух частей, я был в шоке от качества этого продукта. Оптимизация? Не, не слышали. Миссии это отдельный ужас, куча багов.

Плюсы игры:
- есть 2 ветки прохождения: пройти путь никого не убивая или уничтожая всех и вся;
- пара неплохих миссий.

Минусы игры:
- оптимизация;
- баги;
- тупые шутки;
- сломанные NPC;
- частые вылеты;
- бОльшая часть миссий ужасны;
- быстро проходится.

Я хотел дать игре шанс, купить спустя большой промежуток времени, думал, что ошибался и там есть хорошие моменты. Да, они там были, но их очень мало, игру это не спасает. Не рекомендую ни к покупке, ни к игре.","Well, it's time for me to express my opinion on Postal III. Here's what I can say about the game in a nutshell:

A laggy, buggy mess.
As a fan of the first two games, I was shocked by the quality of this product. Optimization? No, never heard of it. The missions are a complete nightmare, riddled with bugs.

Pros:
- There are two paths to progress: complete the game without killing anyone or destroying everyone and everything;
- A couple of decent missions.

Cons:
- Optimization;
- Bugs;
- Stupid jokes;
- Broken NPCs;
- Frequent crashes;
- Most missions are terrible;
- It's too quick to complete.

I wanted to give the game a chance, buying it after a long time, thinking I was wrong and that there were some good moments. Yes, there were some, but they were few and far between, and that doesn't save the game. I do not recommend either purchasing or playing."

FPS проседает (смотришь в небо 60фпс, смотришь на мир 15-20фпс) и фризит постоянно, жесть, и это на самых низких настройках с самым низким разрешением которое мне игра позволяет выбрать 1280х720, ниже нельзя. Может на средне-мощных ПК еще и пойдет, но явно 8ГБ ОЗУ и GeForce 920MX 2ГБ игре не достаточно. При этом у меня Resident Evil 2 2019 летает почти на всех эффектах, конечно в пониженном разрешении.

Странно, что раньше играл в пиратку на обычном по меркам тех лет ноуте Тошиба (2ГБ ОЗУ, 512МБ ГПУ Radeon) и игра выдавала стабильный ФПС. Что-то намудрили разрабы в стимовской версии, иначе быть не может.

Добротная расчлененка, разнообразие оружия, вариативность прохождения. Игру также м ожно пройти никого не убив, а открытый мир пусть и открывается только после прохождения сюжетной линии, но в нем и без этого можно весело провести время. Сатира хоть и не такая как во второй части, но она есть и в некоторых моментах даже есть над чем посмеяться. 

Графика до сих пор выглядит приятной глазу (спасибо движку sourse), левел-дизайн хорош. И я до сих пор нахожу в этой игре какие-то детали, которые не замечаешь при первом заходе (вы например знали, что тут собаки испражняться умеют?).

Короче, игра нормальная. Не лучшая в серии, но и не худшая какой ее признали.","I honestly don't understand the hate towards this game. Seriously, the game is only bad technically; it lags on some missions and crashes occasionally, but it still has most of what we loved about the series.

It has solid dismemberment, a variety of weapons, and a variety of playthroughs. You can also complete the game without killing anyone, and the open world, while unlocked only after completing the storyline, is still fun to play. The satire, while not as intense as in the second game, is still there, and there are even moments that make you laugh.

The graphics still look pleasing to the eye (thanks to the Source engine), and the level design is good. And I still find details in this game that you might not notice the first time you play (for example, did you know that dogs can defecate in it?).

In short, it's an okay game. Not the best in the series, but not the worst it's been acclaimed for."

Well, I was wrong.
Apart from some satisfying dismemberment and some occasionally good music, this game really has no redeeming features and is just an unstable pile of crap.

Expect the following:
-Inconsistent audio volumes, where some moments bleed your ears out, and other you won't hear what the crap anyone is saying.
-The tutorial is obnoxious with way too many popups.
-Prone to crashing, especially whenever you throw an item or throwable weapon.
-Boring and linear mission design, with a lot of escort missions. Thankfully the NPC you need to protect has never died on me, but their AI is just annoying and crap to deal with, takes forever to walk to their destination.
-Constant softlocking, especially in the Police building levels. Doors that are supposed to open up will just stay closed, and you are forced to restart the mission over and over if you haven't quicksaved ever minute.
-Horrible melee combat. Don't even bother using it, as it is extremely tedious to even hit anyone.
-Rocket launcher has caused me to kill myself in the majority of times that I attempted to use it. Don't bother with any other weapons that aren't machine guns, honestly.
-Extremely long loading times. No idea why.
-Constant interruptions from cutscenes. Don't get me wrong. I don't mind cutscenes in videogames. And they aren't the worst in this game. It's just that there are plenty of moments where 20 seconds of gameplay gets interrupted over and over with another cutscene.
-The game features a lot of optional side objectives that you need to furfill if you want the ""good ending"" of the game. Which 90% of the case revolves around NOT killing people. Imagine that. The objective to NOT KILL PEOPLE in a POSTAL GAME.
-The improvised pepper spray flamethrower flame effects look absolutely pathetic.
-Horrible framerate UP THE ASS.
-Some occasional tasteless homophobic jabs. I get that Postal is very silly and often makes tasteless jokes aimed at plenty of different stereotypes and whatnot, I get it, I am fine with jokes. But the homophobic jabs I am talking about are no ""jokes"" that the game is making. Just tasteless insults.

Generally speaking, just don't bother with this game and wait for Postal 4 to get out of Early Access.","I really thought ""it can't be THAT bad, right?""

У игры полно технических проблем, к примеру искажающийся звук, провал противников под пол или застрявший в асфальте финальный босс... Много проблем. Особенно могу затронуть юмор. Какой он? Ну скажем понять его дано далеко не всем. Единственная реально забавная и заметная отсылка - Мавроди, который почему-то ошивается в Катарсисе. 
Эта игра полна багов, проблем с оптимизацией и сомнительных решений, но прям говном я её назвать постыжусь. Как ни странно, в техническом и графических планах она на голову лучше двойки. Графика стала приятнее, от маппинга не вытекают глаза, хоть какое-то разнообразие, а главное появились касцены. Они тоже не самого хорошего качества, тем не менее это не так плохо, как в Серьёзном Сэме, а одноголосная кривая озвучка создаёт ощущение паршивого дешевого фильма, купленного в переулке у Дяди Васи. Не знаю, была ли это их оригинальная задумка, но эффект вышел неплохой.

В общем... Что можно сказать в итоге? Мусор? Да, но на разок хватит. Думаю оценка 6/10 это максимум, которая она заслуживает. Играть вам в эту хрень или нет решайте сами, всё сказанное выше лично моё мнение.","I think a lot of people are deliberately underrating it without even playing it properly. The game has a lot of technical issues, like distorted sound, enemies falling through the floor, or the final boss getting stuck in the pavement... Lots of problems. I'd especially like to touch on the humor. What is it like? Well, let's say not everyone gets it. The only truly funny and noticeable reference is Mavrodi, who for some reason hangs out in Catharsis. 
This game is full of bugs, optimization issues, and questionable decisions, but I'd be embarrassed to call it crap. Oddly enough, in both technical and graphical terms, it's a cut above the 2. The graphics are nicer, the mapping isn't eye-watering, there's at least some variety, and most importantly, there are now cassettes. They're not exactly the best quality either, but it's not as bad as Serious Sam, and the monotonous, clunky voiceover creates the feeling of a lousy, cheap movie bought in an alley from Uncle Vasya. I don't know if that was their original idea, but the effect is pretty good.

So... What can I say in the end? Is it trash? Yeah, but it's enough for a one-time watch. I think a 6/10 is the maximum it deserves. Whether you play this piece of crap or not is up to you; everything I've said above is just my personal opinion."

Так, игра местами лучше 2-ой части - она менее затянутая, а геймплей делает всё, чтобы вы не заскучали...ну, пытается. Всёж некоторые миссии правда скучные, но там и много тех, где ты и сам под крутую музыку и дробашом натурально входишь в раш. 

Меня в игре расстроили несколько вещей: 
1. нет нормальных пинков и прыжка
2. Оптимизация... Это 3,14здец - если не будешь чистить сохранения игра будет вылетать как чёрт.
3. юмор - он заметно хуже второй части.

А так всё. Как продолжение второй части -  игра вызывает много вопросов, ну а как трешачок на часиков 4-6 самое оно. В конце концов - всё не так плохо, как многие говорят
","I liked it...
Well, the game is better than the second game in some places – it's less drawn-out, and the gameplay does its best to keep you entertained... well, it tries. Some missions are truly boring, but there are also plenty where you naturally rush into a rush with a bang, accompanied by cool music.

A few things about the game disappointed me:

1. No proper kicks or jumps.
2. Optimization... It's crap – if you don't clear your saves, the game will crash like hell.
3. The humor – it's noticeably worse than the second game.

And that's about it. As a sequel to the second game, the game raises a lot of questions, but as a 4-6 hour trasher, it's perfect. Ultimately, it's not as bad as many say.

Si bien este juego posee muchos bugs, crasheos y mala optimización (no es como que el dos no tenga, tiene como para hacer un pastel) Considero que esta entrega respeto muy bien el universo de postal en lo que es su violencia,  humor negro y satira hacia ciertos grupos que los fans de este mundillo ya se saben. además de inclusión de personajes famosos y previos de la franquicia. 
No considero que el pase de escenarios haya estado tan mal pero esto ciertamente daba para un mundo abierto de verdad (no pura carga entre pantallas) lastima que los desarrolladores no lograron aprovechar el motor para eso.

En fin, lo considero un experimento el cual mato la critica y el abandono de akella al no ponerse a arreglar lo que correspondía.
Comprenlo si sale en oferta por si les da morbo probarlo aunque sea un rato.","Let's see...
While this game has many bugs, crashes, and poor optimization (it's not like the second one doesn't have any, it has enough to make a cake), I think this installment respects the postcard universe very well, with its violence, dark humor, and satire toward certain groups that fans of this world already know. It also includes famous and previous characters from the franchise.

I don't think the stage transition was that bad, but this certainly had the potential for a real open world (not just loading between screens). It's a shame the developers didn't take advantage of the engine for that.

Anyway, I consider it an experiment that killed the critics and the abandonment of Akella by not fixing what was needed.

A couple of years ago I found out, very late, that it finally had come out, but it was supposed to be horrible and unplayable. I was convinced by so many that it was legit unplayable, and that is a dang gong lie! 
Now, I have no idea why Running With Scissors hates this game... 

The story is so darn funny, and it really is a time capsule of history viewed through a satirical bong filter. IS the gameplay perfect? No, no, no... But it does something really different in my opinion, the game has a very old-school arcade-style to it, where you get these little missions, which either have inventive story design, or offer a new kind of take on the same old shoot this and that formula. 

The objectives are interesting, varied, and hysterical. I really do not get the massive hate, maybe I am stroking the game a little too much, but how else are you gonna climax? The shooting and combat are fun simply due to the strange arcade vibe the game has, things are a bit off here and there, the A.I and some areas needed more work, but it's just so much fun.

What is wrong with a game that is just enjoyable? It's fun, brutal, mayhem and I love every second of it, not to mention the branching paths and choices offer massive replay value. This game really does deserve a second chance, it has some issues but they are few and far in between and never stop the game from progressing or cause any real agony. 

I just cannot understand why people lied about this game, I get not liking it, but you all made me think it was unplayable, and yet, three hours of game time later, I had not one issue. I have to say the game has some because some people report them, but the game did not even lag, and also looked damn sexy.

Niestety jednak uważam, że jeśli zgredek psychopata może bezkarnie wjechać z działaniami wojennymi do sąsiedniego kraju na zasadzie ""bo tak"" i do tego grozi bronią atomową krajom które mogły by mu w tym przeszkodzić. To z całym szacunkiem i bez urazy do artystów robiących gry, trzeba to zbojkotować.

Unfortunately, however, I believe that if a psychopathic Dobby can invade a neighboring country with impunity, simply because he wants to, and on top of that, threatens any countries that might prevent him with nuclear weapons, then, with all due respect and no offense to game developers, it should be boycotted. It took decades for the world to once again look at Russians as civilized people after the end of the Cold War, and yet here's one Dobby-looking brat with an ego the size of a galaxy, whose stupid actions ensure that for another decade, such a noble nation will be perceived as mindless scum, doing dirty work in the hands of a mindless KGB colonel with dictatorial aspirations.

It's not your fault, developers, whoever you think is your dictator in Moscow, but unfortunately, you, along with all this Russian madness, should be isolated from the civilized world, both politically and economically. Before a global tragedy occurs and your government (in the person of a possessed idiot) begins to function stably in modern civilization. Until then, you should be boycotted in every sphere of economics and politics, barred from external influence, and without foreign sales. Perhaps a lack of financial resources will finally force your oligarchs to think twice and eliminate from the system this cancerous tumor gnawing at your country: the dwarf psychopath from the KGB."

110890474,czech,2022.01.24 20:45,❌,❌,0.5,0,"Postal 3 je čierna ovca celej série. 

Vždy keď som zapol Steam a snažil sa nájsť zabudnutý tretí diel (nie je náhoda, že vám vyhľadávač hru neponúkne ani po zadaní presného názvu) ostával mi rozum stáť nad hodnotením tejto hry. 
Vždy som si hovoril, že to predsa nemôže byť až tak strašné, a keby aj bolo, aspoň sa na tom zasmejem. 

Predsa len pôvodné Postal hry neboli žiadne skvosty, jednalo sa hlavne o silne podpriemerné hry (čo sa týka technického stavu a prevedenia), no čím dokázali hráča zachytiť, bolo svojimi kontroverziami a relatívne zábavným gameplayom. Preto som podobne jednoduchú zábavu očakával aj od tohoto dielu. Zo začiatku sa zdalo, že sa mi to aj splní, keď prvotné cutscény nevyzerali vôbec k zahodeniu, bol som schopný prehliadnuť zlé ovládanie v prvých dvoch misiách, no následne vytriezvenie prišlo hneď akonáhle sa vám otvorí celá mapa a máte v prvej misii pochytať HIV-mačky. 

Celé mesto je nudné, ploché, ovládanie je ako keby sa Postal Dude ožral a rozhodol sa pilotovať (nie šoférovať) tank spojený s autobusom, zbrane nefungujú ako majú, inventár je nesystematický ba až chaotický a otravnosť nepriateľov, des a hrôza. Po kritickej stránke som viac-menej opísal aj predchádzajúce dva Postaly, čo, ale táto hra dokázala najviac posrať je humor, ktorý časom začína vyznievať neskutočne cringe, ako keby scenár písal samotný Troška, fakt, že je Source Engine (my precious) naprogramovaný s blbu-odolnými kódmi, pri ktorých podobne ako pri varení ryže, nie je možné, aby to dokázal niekto posrať, ale aj optimalizáciu, ktorá aj na mojej zostave (i7-3770 3.4 GHz, 12 GB RAM, GTX 1050TI) na najnižších nastaveniach a pri hraní v okne, je stále hlboko pod úrovňou znesiteľného frameratu. 

Prosto, aby som to zhrnul. Ak si chcete zahrať Postal 3, uvažujte skôr nad alternatívnym spôsobom získania produktu, než priamou cestou, alebo si vyčkajte na fanúšikovský mód Catharsis reborn, ktorý sľubuje opravenie celej hry spolu s príbehom, alebo si skrátka zahrajte Postal 2 spolu s datáčom Paradise Lost, ktorý popiera celú existenciu tretieho dielu. V stave v akom hra je (kedy vás hra ju núti vypnúť štyri razy po sebe, pretože nie je schopná prepočítať, alebo si zapamätať, jednu zmenu nastavení) sa jedná o zatratiteľný počin, pri ktorom som fakt rád, že sa od produktu dištancovalo aj samotné Running With Scissors. 

2/10 - A za čo? Asi z milosti. Dva body si to nezaslúži ani za úspešné spustenie.","Postal 3 is the black sheep of the whole series. 

Every time I turned on Steam and tried to find the forgotten third part (it's no coincidence that the search engine doesn't offer you the game even after entering the exact name) I was left wondering about the rating of this game. 
I always told myself that it couldn't be that terrible, and if it was, at least I'd laugh about it. 

After all, the original Postal games were no gems, they were mainly very subpar games (in terms of technical condition and design), but what they managed to capture the player was their controversies and relatively fun gameplay. That's why I expected similarly simple entertainment from this part as well. From the beginning, it seemed that it would come true, when the initial cutscenes did not seem to be thrown away at all, I was able to overlook the bad control in the first two missions, but then the sobering came as soon as the whole map opens up to you and you have to catch HIV-cats in the first mission. 

The whole city is boring, flat, the controls are as if the Postal Dude got drunk and decided to pilot (not drive) a tank connected to a bus, the weapons don't work as they should, the inventory is unsystematic and even chaotic, and the annoyingness of the enemies, horror and horror. On the critical side, I more or less described the previous two Postals, but what this game was able to screw up the most is the humor, which over time begins to sound incredibly cringe, as if the script was written by Troška himself, the fact that the Source Engine (my precious) is programmed with fool-proof codes, where, like cooking rice, it is impossible for anyone to screw it up, but also the optimization, which even on my system (i7-3770 3.4 GHz, 12 GB RAM, GTX 1050TI) on the lowest settings and when playing in a window, is still well below the level of bearable framerate. 

Just to summarize. If you want to play Postal 3, consider an alternative way to get the product rather than the direct route, or wait for the fan mod Catharsis reborn, which promises to fix the entire game along with the story, or in short, play Postal 2 along with the Paradise Lost dater, which denies the entire existence of the third part. In the state in which the game is (when the game forces you to turn it off four times in a row, because it is not able to recalculate, or remember, a single setting change) it is a damnable act, in which I am really glad that Running With Scissors itself has distanced itself from the product. 

2/10 - And for what? Probably out of grace. It doesn't deserve two points even for a successful launch."

В игре есть свободный режим, но в нём только 4 карты. Также непонятно зачем при потере примерно 50% здоровья Чувак упоминает волшебные таблетки здоровья, когда в игре просто нет никаких предметов, восстанавливающих здоровье. На этом к задумке претензии заканчиваются.
В игре достаточно хороший юмор, особенно в монологах Чувака в катсценах и игра вполне могла бы быть хорошей если бы не...
БАГИ.

Да, в этой игре просто тонна багов, причём очень серьёзных. Застрять в полу? Пожалуйста! Сломать инвентарь? Да пожалуйста! Крутить чампа вокруг врага, вместо того, чтобы напасть на него? Милости просим! Крашнуть игру в любой момент? Да без Б! Спасибо что хоть крашится нечасто.
Достижения ну просто ребусы уровня ""Цикада 3301"". Никто толком и не знает как они вообще работают.
Кто такие террористы по мнению достижения? Аль-Каида? Фигушки! Террористом оказался носорог, встречающийся раз за игру. Вот теперь идите и убивайте его 200 с х**** раз.

Ах да, оружие ближнего боя вам тут не понадобится. Его урезали до уровня силиконовой дубинки. Даже божественное мачете, разрубающее всю толпу на куски во 2й части тут просто мусор.

Вообщем игра полный провал, поскольку баги фиксить никто не собирается. И своих денег не стоит. Да и вообще никаких не стоит.
А могло ведь выйти весьма неплохо.","The first thing you notice is the third-person controls, but you get used to it. Then comes the disappointment that the game isn't open-world. There's a free-roam mode, but it only has four maps. It's also unclear why, when you lose about 50% of your health, the Dude mentions magic health pills when there are simply no health-restoring items in the game. That's about it.
The game has some pretty good humor, especially in the Dude's cutscene monologues, and the game could have been quite good if not for...
BUGS.

Yes, this game has a ton of bugs, and some are pretty serious. Get stuck on the floor? Okay! Break your inventory? Yeah, right! Spin Champa around the enemy instead of attacking them? You're welcome! Crash the game at any time? No problem! At least it doesn't crash often.
The achievements are just puzzles like ""Cicada 3301."" Nobody really knows how they work.
Who are the terrorists, according to the achievement? Al-Qaeda? No way! The terrorist turned out to be a rhinoceros, encountered once per game. Now go and kill it 200 fucking times.

Oh yeah, you won't need melee weapons here. They've been reduced to the level of a silicone baton. Even the divine machete, which cuts an entire crowd to pieces in the second game, is just garbage.

Overall, the game is a complete failure, since no one is going to fix the bugs. And it's not worth the money. Or any money at all.
And it could have been quite good."

 я решил еще раз поиграть, 
иии... Я даже обучение не осилил))
1) Камера. Она на столько неудобная и постоянная тряска еще, ощущение, что я на курсы по подготовке космонавтов записался)
Та и зачем в Postal камера от 3 лица??
2) Физика. Ну я точно не помню, как со стрельбой, но зато отлично помню, что в ближнем бою то еще испытание. Ну это опять же из-за камеры.
3) Задания. Собирать яблоки, говно, засранные салфетки и тд, как какой-то попуск - не очень. И зачем вообще это делать?

Well, let me elaborate. When I was younger, about 14, I played this game on a pirated copy and liked it. I even finished a bit. Now, 6 years later,
I decided to play it again, and... I couldn't even get through the tutorial.
1) Camera. It's so awkward and constantly shaking, it feels like I've signed up for astronaut training.
So why does Postal need a third-person camera??
2) Physics. Well, I don't remember exactly how it is with shooting, but I do remember that close combat is a real challenge. Well, that's because of the camera again.
3) Missions. Collecting apples, shit, soiled napkins, and so on, like some kind of escapade, isn't very appealing. And why even bother?
Basically, the game is garbage. The only positives are decent graphics and dismemberment, and that's it."

Secondly, even bad games have their own fun. With such an obviously awkward plot, forget playing it with your intelligence. Just watching for fun? I can't think of any other way. And then, my personal advice: if you're not like me, knowing this game is terrible and not a collector, then I suggest just playing the free version for fun (I'm being a bit of a jerk here). Honestly, if you have the money, why not buy POSTAL2 or POSTAL Redux? RWS has a new game coming out in May, so why buy this?

Postal 2 - сатира на всю американскую жизнь (да и на всякую жизнь), с совокупностью утрированных до предела явлений, и доказывающая, что внутри человека глаголит звериное поведение (сама по себе игра нормальная, это, в общем-то, вы going postal эт зис поинт.

Postal 3 - ... ну... Postal 3 - игра ни о чём.

Буквально. Игра выглядит хорошо и привлекательно, но по факту заходит несколько уровней. По всей видимости, разрабам зашла концепция ""субботы"" и ""воскресенья"" из Postal 2, где мир - комично поставленный линейный шутер, время от времени предлагающий определенного рода задания (по типу убить 20 зомби или перерезать 10 слонов), поэтому Postal 3 - полностью от и до состоит из таких уровней - увы - погулять по новому городу и его окрестностям не дадут, только во Free Roam режиме после прохождения игры (то есть когда это уже нахyй не сдалось). Сами же задания дико унылые. Сбор обкончанных салфеток пылесосом, сбор яблок пылесосом, сбор мячей пылесосом, сбор навоза пылесосом - тут либо им было лень писать код для чего-то другого, либо у кого-то был фетиш. Звучит это смешно, но на деле полная xeрь: пылесос криво работает, а стрелять из него говном с кончёй совсем не смешно (здесь мы смертельно близко подобрались к жестокости).

А жестокость в игре убавила борзо: если в предыдущей игре можно было обоccать бомжа, доведя его до рвотных позывов, а затем отсечь голову и наблюдать кроваво-блевотную струю из шеи, то здесь - ни поccать нормально нельзя, ни порасчленять, а всё благодаря Source двиглу, непонятно откуда вообще взявшемуся. Поскольку сюда впаяли вид от третьего лица (видимо, чтоб не делать модели от первого), то всякое неогнестрельное оружие абсолютно непригодно к использованию, так как прицел тупо не соответствует реальности. В любой Source-игре рукопашное оружие (и подобное ему по принципу работы) с видом от третьего лица работает наперекосяк и требует определенного рода фиксов, абаче авторы Postal 3 на хepу это всё видали. Всю игру я провел с пистолетом, автоматом и пулемётом, а не с пчелиными ульями, канистрами с бензином, весёлым пылесосом с гoвнoм, мачете, лопатой, кувалдой, ёбнyтoй обезьяной и так далее.

И говоря о том, что Source-основа игры дико не отполирована с точки зрения вида от третьего лица, стоит сказать, что она ВООБЩЕ никак не отполирована. На протяжении игры вы встретите огромное количество затычек с Half-Life 2. Пластмассовые звуки оторванных конечностей, знакомые по Garry's Mod звуки рэгдоллов, текстуры дырок от пуль, плоские текстуры на брашах и уйма других мелочей, которые создают неуничтожимое ощущение игры в Source-мод на Half-Life 2, скачанный в архивчике с Яндекс.Диск'а. На этот косяк можно было бы и не обращать внимания, если бы игра в целом была играбельной, но так это приводит к астрономически возрастающему негодованию и хейту.

Музыка хороша, но играет вообще не к месту, да еще и на повторе, это, БЛЯTЬ, хуже чем продолжающаяся музыка в меню паузы. 

Оптимизация нулевая. Представьте, что вы в том же Garry's Mod'е понаспаунили тысячи энтити и пытаетесь повеселиться - вот это и есть Postal 3, так как Source вообще никак не был отполирован. Только вот в Garry's Mod не существует пределов оптимизации тупо потому, что игрока не ограничивают в нагрузке движка (да и вообще она зависит от него самого), а тут игра сама по себе рождает NPC и сама же от этого страдает.

Говоря о NPC - тормоза невероятные. Не сказать, что в Postal 2 они были умными, но стрелять по крайней мере умели нормально, а здесь xep пойми что.

Вот и выходит, что Postal 3 - Source-движок, не подготовленный под использование в целях игры с полу-открытым миром, огульно перекрашенный в плане меню, звуков, текстур и моделей, с глючным искусственным интеллектом и криво работающим вооружением, нулевым геймдизайном и звукорежиссурой, гoвнo-боссом и отсутствием идеи как таковой, о чем было в самом начале. Играть в это, однако, всё ещё можно, но просто скучно, невероятно скучно.","Postal - translated from English as ""to go nuts"" - is a game about madness in a mental hospital and manic hallucinations, a distorted, vile essay on the sweet devastation of the flesh.

Postal 2 is a satire on American life (and any life, really), with a collection of phenomena exaggerated to the extreme, proving that animal behavior speaks within a person (the game itself is fine; it's basically you going Postal at this point).

Postal 3 - ... well... Postal 3 is a game about nothing.

Literally. The game looks good and attractive, but in reality, it only lasts a few levels. Apparently, the developers liked the ""Saturday"" and ""Sunday"" concept from Postal 2, where the world is a comically staged linear shooter, periodically offering certain tasks (like killing 20 zombies or slaughtering 10 elephants), so Postal 3 is completely made up of such levels. Unfortunately, you won't be able to explore the new city and its surroundings, only in Free Roam mode after completing the game (that is, when it's no longer worth fucking doing). I gave up). The missions themselves are incredibly boring. Vacuuming up shit-stained napkins, vacuuming up apples, vacuuming up balls, vacuuming up manure—either they were too lazy to code anything else, or someone had a fetish. It sounds funny, but in reality, it's complete crap: the vacuum cleaner doesn't work properly, and shooting shit and cum out of it is not funny at all (we're getting fatally close to violence here).

And the violence in the game has been toned down significantly: while in the previous game you could pee on a homeless person until he vomits, then cut off his head and watch the bloody, vomit-filled stream of blood pour out of his neck, here you can't pee properly or dismember anyone, all thanks to the Source engine, which came from who knows where. Since they stuck a third-person view here (apparently to avoid using first-person models), Any non-firearm weapon is completely unusable because the aiming reticle simply doesn't correspond to reality. In any Source game, melee weapons (and similar ones) in third-person view are completely flawed and require some sort of fix, otherwise the creators of Postal 3 couldn't care less. I spent the entire game with a pistol, a submachine gun, and a machine gun, not with beehives, gasoline canisters, a cheerful vacuum cleaner filled with shit, a machete, a shovel, a sledgehammer, a fucking monkey, and so on.

And speaking of the game's Source base being wildly unpolished in third-person view, it's worth saying that it's not polished at all. Throughout the game, you'll encounter countless references to Half-Life 2: the plastic sounds of severed limbs, the familiar sounds of Garry's Mod. Ragdolls, bullet hole textures, flat brush textures, and a ton of other little things create the indelible feeling of playing a Source mod for Half-Life 2, downloaded in an archive from Yandex.Disk. This flaw could be overlooked if the game were generally playable, but it leads to astronomically increasing indignation and hate.

The music is good, but it plays completely out of place, and on a loop, which is FUCKING worse than the ongoing music in the pause menu.

Optimization is zero. Imagine spawning thousands of entities in Garry's Mod and trying to have fun—that's what Postal 3 is, since Source was completely unpolished. The only thing is, in Garry's Mod, there are no optimization limits, simply because the player isn't limited in engine load (and, in fact, it depends on the engine itself), and Here, the game itself generates NPCs and suffers because of it.

Speaking of NPCs, the lag is incredible. I wouldn't say they were smart in Postal 2, but at least they could shoot normally, whereas here, it's a complete mess.

So, it turns out that Postal 3 is a Source engine unprepared for use in a semi-open-world game, a wholesale redesign of menus, sounds, textures, and models, with glitchy AI and clunky weapons, zero game design and sound design, a crap boss, and a complete lack of concept, which was the case from the very beginning. It's still playable, but it's just boring, incredibly boring."

この世の終わりみたいな操作性と作業ミッションと強制終了があらゆる評価点を台無しにしていますが、欠点は二億のPOSTAL2ファンダムがRWS社公式と一緒にボロクソに書きなぐっているのであえて評価点を書きましょう。

・グラフィック
良好。TPS視点に限定された弊害で死体や細かな掲示物などを読みにくい弱点があるものの、血や吐瀉物や白濁液をNPCに塗りたくれるしポスタル（人名）のモーションは[b] 見た目自体は [/b]良好で当時の水準は満たせています。まぁ当たり判定は変なんですけど。
頻繁に挿入されるコミック風のアートスタイルはなかなか魅力的。ここは4にも継承されてますね。

・音楽
チュートリアルで流れる「Showbiz Crisis」が本当に素晴らしい。多くのプレイヤーはこの物悲しくもワクワクさせられるBGMに聞き惚れつつ、爽快感のかき消えたグレネードやガソリン缶や跳べないポスタルくんに愕然とさせられるのです。

・ネタ
いい感じに下劣です。吸い込んだティッシュから絞り出した男汁をそこら辺のおっさんやポールダンサーに吹き付けられるのはこのゲームだけです。古臭さは歴史資料と割り切りましょう。


と、評価点が無いわけではありませんがこのゲームはどこからどう見てもクソゲーです。本当にダメなのでRWSの自虐以外で話題にならない。散々待たされた挙句に[b] こんなもん [/b]を定価で買っちまったユーザーの憤激はごもっともで、今後改善される有料βでもないのにそれと同レベルのクソゲーをいまさら買う必要性はありません。","[h1] It was under ¥300, so ""I regret nothing""[/h1]
The apocalyptic controls, the task missions, and the forced crashes ruin every point of praise, but the 200 million POSTAL 2 fandom, along with the official RWS, have already trashed the game's flaws, so I'll go ahead and write my points.

-Graphics
Good. While the TPS perspective makes it hard to read corpses and small notices, you can smear blood, vomit, and milky liquid on NPCs, and the Postal (name) animations [b] look good and meet the standards of the time. Well, the hit detection is a bit weird, though.
The frequently used comic-style art style is quite appealing. This is carried over to 4.

-Music
The ""Showbiz Crisis"" song that plays during the tutorial is truly amazing. Many players are captivated by the melancholy yet exciting music, only to be shocked by the grenades, gas cans, and inability to jump Postale, which completely erase any sense of exhilaration.

・Story
It's just plain vulgar. This is the only game where you can squeeze out man juice from a tissue and spray it on random old men and pole dancers. Let's just accept its dated nature as a historical document.

So, while there are some positive aspects to this game, it's a piece of crap no matter how you look at it. It's so bad that it's barely even talked about outside of RWS's self-deprecating comments. The anger of users who waited so long and then ended up buying this [b] crap [/b] at full price is understandable, and there's no need to buy another crap game of the same caliber now, even without a paid beta that will see improvements."

Postal 2 ile zirveyi gören bu seri de, zirvenin yerini değiştirememiş bir oyun POSTAL 3. Geçtiğimiz yıllarda 4. oyun da çıktı lakin ben henüz kendisini denemedim. Sıra ona da gelecek, önce 1. oyun var bakalım karışık bir sıra ile gidiyoruz. 

Gel gelelim POSTAL 3 ismindeki bu oyuna:

POSTAL 3, 2.Oyundaki patlamanın ardından yan kasabaya taşınan ve cebi delik Postal Dude adındaki ana karakterimizin, para kazanma uğruna denediği işleri bize anlatıyor. Açıkçası hikaye anlatımı beni memnun etmedi. Oyunda ne bir alt yazı ne de iyi animasyonlara sahip bir ara sahne var. Karikatürler ve hoş sesli bir anlatıcı üzerinden anlatılmak istenmiş hikaye. Kesinlikle doğru bir seçim olmadığını düşünmek ile beraber, postal serisinin genel tarzı bu olduğu için de öyle sert bir yorum yapamıyorum bu konuda. Sert yorum yapmamın daha kolay olduğu konular yok mu peki ? 

Tabi ki var :)

-Hikaye anlatımı bildiğimiz Postal tarzı olsa da oyunun başlangıç ve son kısmında mevcut, onlar dışındaki kritik anlarda Postal Dude kendisi bir değerlendirme yapıyor ve çizgi roman tarzında büyük ve vurgulu birkaç yazı oluyor çoğu görevde. Yani anlayacağınız hikayeyi anlamayalım ya da İngilizce bilmeyenler zorlansın diye mi yapılmış dersiniz bilmiyorum. Her ne içil yapılmışsa saçma olmuş, bu tarz grafiklere sahip ve bol bol ara sahne aksiyonu içeren bir postal oyunu oynamak isterdim. Böyle olması üzdü birazcık beni. :/

-Kontroller çıktığı yıl için oldukça hantal. Optimizasyon sıkıntısı mı dersin, yoksa görevlerin bir anda Bug a girmesi mi. Postal adına yakışmayacak türde bir çok hata ve tamamlanmadan bırakılmış mekanik var oyunda. Misal kopan kol, bacak, kafa gibi uzuvları, hatırladığım kadarıyla postal iki de karşımızdaki insanlara fırlattığımızda kusmalarına sebep veriyordu lakin bu oyunda polisin önüne fırlattığım kafa sayesinde işlerin öyle olmadığını anladım. Normalde benim bildiğim o kafa polisi kustururdu ve bende oradan rahatlıkla kaçar, mal gibi ölmezdim. 

-Grafikler güzel, riske girmeyip Source motoru kullanmak iyi bir tercih olmuş. Tabi birde optimize etselerdi oyunu daha da övüp göklere çıkarabilirdik lakin görünen köy kılavuz istemez. Kasmalar can sıkıcı düzeyde. GTA 5 de 1080p normal ayarlarda, 60 FPS nin altına normal düşmeyen bir sistemin, POSTAL 3 gibi 2011 çıkışlı bir oyunda ağlaması, insana garip geliyor.

-Bazı görevlerin opsiyonel olarak taraf seçme imkanı tanıması beni oldukça mutlu etti. Spoiler vermek gibi olmasın da 3 görevdeki polis ve ekonomistler arasında ki savaşta tarafımı kendim seçmekten ve devamında polis memuru olarak hizmetime devam etmekten dolayı fazlasıyla tatmin oldum, mekaniği de oldukça iyi ve güzel buldum. 

-Segway araçlarının oyunda sadece süs değil de kullanılabilir olması gerçekten iyi olmuş. Bir yerden bir yere amele gibi koşmaktan bizi bir nebze de olsa kurtarıyor. 

-Oyun açık dünya değil. Ve bu beni çok şaşırttı. Yarı açık dünya söz konusu. Postal 2 de oluğu gibi özgür olamıyoruz, çizgisel ilerliyor oyun.

-Kedi mekaniği bildiğimiz ve hatırladığımız gibi karşımıza çıkıyor. Yine saldırgan, yine hırçın, yine etkili. Zaten Meksikalı adamların olduğu görevde işin aslını anlayana kadar bayağı bir debelendim. Oyun bizi sadece 2-3 satırlık bir cümle ile yönlendirdiğinden, komik şapkalı abilerin 15 kediyi toplayamadığım her saniye akın akın geleceğini düşünemedim. Bir şekilde görevi geçtim tabi de, yine de zorladı bu beni ziyadesiyle.

-Yakın dövüş berbat. adama öldüresiye yumruk atıyorum ama tepki yok. Sadece pala ile saldırdığımda tatmin oldum. Onun dışında çöp bir yakın dövüş mekaniği söz konusu diyebilirim. Havayı dövme konusunda Skyrim ile yarışır.

-Ateşli silahlar ise bunun aksine muazzam, vücudun her bölgesi kanıyor ve silahtan silaha değişerek parçalanıyor. Kafa her türlü kopuyor yani anlayacağınız.

Başka da bir şey yok oyunla alakalı. Klasik POSTAL. Daha çok kasan, bol gönderme ve kara mizahlı, açık dünyasız, ara sahnesiz, Source motorunun hakkını yalnızca parçalanma efektlerinde veren. Ve POSTAL serisinin asıl yapımcısının bile ana seriye dahil olduğunu kabul etmediği bir oyun Postal 3. Onlar bile oyunla ilgili böyle düşünüyorken bizim gidip de oyunu göklere çıkarmamız oldukça saçma olur.

Ama yine de tavsiye ederim. Netice de ilginç, eşsiz, iyi denmeyecek, ortalama bir deneyim sunuyor.
4 TL ye düştüğü anlarda, kaçırmayın efendim. 

(20 TL vermek israf olur.)

PUAN: 47/100

Что могу сказать, игра странная по управлению, рус озвучка отстой, вылетела игра в начале прохождения сюжета, но хоть есть сохранения по этапам миссии. 2 раза зависала игра и отвисала спустя секунд 20. Управление не то что сложное, как не удобное. Постоянные вылеты за карту при смерти. Вышел из игры изза того, что в миссии с фанатиками багнулась игра и мне не давали босса фанатиков. Как пройду игру напишу еще обзор

UPD ПРОШЕЛ ИГРУ: 
Что могу сказать, часто вылетала игра, но автосохранения по этапам спасали. Часто застревали НПС которые следовали за мною. Графика очень не плохая, ближний бой вообще ужас. НО я хочу отдать должное предпоследней миссии - Спасение животных из канализации. Саундтрек просто на высшем уровне, просто идешь и крамсаешь всех китайцев на своем пути под отличную музычку. Этот уровень отличается от других тем, что он более длиннее. Там даже карта намного лучше сделана чем Катарсис. Если бы разработчики делали игру операясь на последние уровни, я думаю у игры было бы меньше плохих отзывов, ведь первые миссии оочень скучные, а последние заставляют еще и еще играть, увы это конец игры, а перепроходить на другие концовки нехочу, ибо я уже замучался видеть постоянные баги. Рейт я не изменю. НО я хочу что бы Акелла сделала игру По посталу, ведь щас уже выходит Бреин дамаг. Но что бы за Акеллой больше следили, и на новую часть небыло багов и больших ожиданий.

Когда узнал что вышла третья был безмерно рад. Установил поиграл. Ну не без косяков, но удовольствие я получил.","I don't know why people hate this game. I started playing the second and Apocalypse years ago and have replayed them a hundred times. When I found out there was a third one out, I was overjoyed. I installed it and played it. Well, it wasn't without its flaws, but I enjoyed it."
105287275,russian,2021.11.05 16:22,✅,✅,0.5,1,"Начинал играть с сильно заниженными ожиданиями. До этого я уже пробовал играть на пиратке и мягко говоря опыт был не самый лучший, игра постоянно тормозила и в конечном итоге на третьем уровне игра просто сломалась, после чего желание играть отпало. Но вот где-то год спустя я беру postal 3 по скидке и решаюсь таки дать игре второй шанс. И знаете, игра этим шансом воспользовалась. Не знаю какие патчи стоят на стимовской версии, но в отличии от большинства ""torrent edition"" в это можно без проблем играть, и даже получать удовольствие. Да-да вы удовольствие. Взглянув трезво на postal 3 после всего что нам дарит игровая индустрия с последнее время(за частную по технической части не успающее третьему посталу на релизе, а иногда даже хуже), и особенно после совершенно беззубого postal 4, postal 3 кажется уже неплохой игрой, а которой есть забавные моменты, приятный геймплей, особенно что касается импакта, крутой саундтрек, симпатичная картинка, и даже вариативность, которая даёт нам по итогу прийти к одной из двух концовок. Большой проблемой третьего постала на мой взгляд является его незавершённость, то ту, то там проскакивают различные косяки, да и в целом игре не хватает...целостности. Сюжет игры скачет галопом по Европам и даже это он делает не равномерно, в начале игра встречает тебя уным обучением, потом бам, бам различные сменяющие друг друга и слабо между собой связанные задания. Потом рутинные однообразные квесты(если мы играем за хорошего парня, я именно так игру проходил). И вот уже через пару часов бац уже битва с финальным боссом. Да игра очень короткая, я её добил за 4 часа. Конечно в планах есть ещё перепройти на плохую концовку, но это когда нибудь потом.
Что я могу скать пт итогу. Игра может скрасить ваш вечерок, если вы устали от современных одинаковых, абсолютно стерильных во всех отношениях игр. Игра приятная, местами конечно подбешивает геймдизайном, куда ж без этого в отечественной игре. По технической части всё неплохо, фпс до неиграбельных значений не падал, сейвы не ломались, управление тоже работало исправно(в отличие от пиратки), вылеты за 4 часа были всего 2 раза, при этом сейвы, опять же не потёрлись. Решать играть или нет только вам, а от меня заслуженные 5,5/10","I started playing with very low expectations. I'd already tried a pirated version, and to put it mildly, it wasn't the best experience. The game constantly lagged, and eventually, on the third level, it simply crashed, after which I lost all desire to play. But about a year later, I picked up Postal 3 on sale and decided to give it a second chance. And you know, the game took advantage of that chance. I don't know what patches are on the Steam version, but unlike most ""torrent editions,"" this one is playable without any issues, and even enjoyable. Yes, enjoyable. Taking a sober look at Postal 3, after everything the gaming industry has been giving us lately (particularly the technical underperformance of Postal 3 at release, and sometimes even worse), and especially after the completely lackluster Postal 4, Postal 3 already seems like a decent game, with some funny moments, enjoyable gameplay (especially in terms of impact), a cool soundtrack, nice graphics, and even the variability that ultimately allows us to reach one of two endings. A big problem with Postal 3, in my opinion, is its incompleteness; various glitches pop up here and there, and the overall game lacks... cohesion. The game's plot gallops across Europe, and even this is uneven: at the beginning, the game greets you with a simple tutorial, then bam, bam, various loosely connected quests. Then come the routine, monotonous quests (if you're playing as the good guy, which is exactly how I played the game). And then, after a couple of hours, bam, there's the final boss battle. Yes, the game is very short; I finished it in four hours. Of course, I plan to replay it to get the bad ending, but that's for later.
Overall, this game can brighten up your evening if you're tired of modern, identical, completely sterile games. It's enjoyable, although the gameplay can be annoying in places, which is a given in a Russian game. Technically, everything is fine: the FPS never dropped to unplayable levels, saves didn't break, the controls worked perfectly (unlike the pirated version), and there were only two crashes in four hours, and my saves were still intact. Whether you decide to play it or not is entirely up to you, but I give it a well-deserved 5.5/10."

(It's not really as bad as people make it out to be). Let's say you make some random ""normal person"" play this game without being a postal fan or playing the other entries in the series. I'm sure they would have an absolute blast with this game, assuming with what freedoms you can do, who you can kill/side with; the different and unique story lines, characters and mission objectives. Yes, it may not be the most polished or beautiful looking game, and maybe some of the controls don't make sense, (like having to take cover and then vaulting over something instead of being able to jump over objects and obstacles). And one of the reasons this game gets so much hate, is because it was largely looked through past postal fans ""goggles"" so to say. That meaning, there is no large town like in postal 2 or in postal 4. The levels in this game are pretty linear with some having you released in a section of the town and you can run around and do what you want there but it is nowhere near the scale of four or two. Which is where I can see past fans having a problem. And another problem with this game is that they decided to put in some good and bad story line you can follow. Which is pretty stupid... Why add morals to a postal game? ( even if it is mocking them, its still stupid because it can effect the story line.

The game had a morality system featuring two sides; good and evil. Good starts you off playing as a police officer, while evil starts off as you playing as a member of an extremist animal rights faction. Each faction has their own missions.

It sounds simple enough, but the problem is how the system is handled. You see, you can gain good points while evil by taking enemies down non-lethally or continue to get evil points by massacring civilians, but you can only gain evil points by taking down civilians and certain types of hostiles lethally while you’re on the good side. Your character acts like a total saint in the missions, but no matter what you do, you can only go down. Lovely.

This game is also pretty liberal about what it considers “evil” actions. Some of the heinous crimes I’ve committed were
[list]
[*]Going from good to pure evil for accidentally charging into two police officers while sprinting during a mission.
[*]Arresting a man for public urination simply because it wasn’t a mission objective, despite being a crime.
[*]Shooting protesters armed with melee weapons that are actively trying to kill Uwe Boll.
[*]Somehow losing points when fellow police officers were killed by enemies while trying to defend the US-Mexico border.
[/list]
You can use lethal force without being penalized, but only when enemies have firearms themselves. Of course, the game occasionally scatters civilians with dumb AI to make things more “challenging”. Essentially, playing through the “good” route forces you to be careful about your shots and avoid collateral damage.

The question is, why bother adding a “good route” when it forces you to play completely against how the series is usually played? Sure, that could be a fun challenge for an errand or two, but building an entire route around it is dumb. Did the people that make this even fully understand what the series was about?

Unlike Postal 2, the game is linear. While there is a large city that could be used to link missions from one to another, it’s only used in patrol missions on the good side, where you’re confined to one part of the city and have to stop criminals. Otherwise, you’re teleported from one area to another without being able to explore the city or cause mayhem between missions, which is one of the things that made Postal 2 so good. 

The strange thing is that beating the game once opens up a freeplay mode in the city, letting you do whatever you want in it and go into several buildings featured in missions (but without any meaningful law enforcement or things to find), so they clearly were able to do a Postal 2-style world at one point. What happened? No time or money? Developer incompetence?

The missions themselves range from “generic third person shooting sequences” to “stop criminals in the city”. 

As odd as it sounds, the generic shooter sequences are the best part of the game; there’s no annoying objectives, no unfun bosses, and little ways for it to glitch out. It still finds a way to piss you off, though; some missions force you to kill everyone before proceeding, but doesn’t tell you how many enemies are left. Over missions have infinitely respawning enemies, but you have no idea about this until you notice they keep coming after killing them a few times.

The worst is the “patrol” missions that appear in the good path. In these, you’re given a section of the city to roam around in and stop crime. It sounds like it’s a return to how Postal 2 did things, but it completely drops the ball because there’s no indication of where to go. All you do is mindlessly run around until a cutscene appears, taze and arrest the character(s) shown in it, then continue on. You can shoot enemies if they have guns and fire back, which doesn’t do a lot to change things up. There’s no hint about how many crimes you need to stop until the mission ends, and you must stop certain crimes before others will appear, so the whole thing is essentially a linear romp, but you have no damn idea where to go. It’s as dreadful as it sounds.

Making things worse is how buggy the game is. From crashes to pisspoor AI, Postal 3 knows how to be a mess. Some fun examples include
[list]
[*]Allowing the game to restart from a game over instead of loading a save the moment the Postal Dude dies can cause the game to break in various ways. This includes as a vital NPC deciding to stay where he is instead of moving to his destination, the game becoming unstable, and, somehow, the controls completely messing up, making the Postal Dude uncontrollable. If any of these happen, you’ll have to reload from an earlier save and hope that fixed it. If it doesn’t, you’ll have to close out of the program (if it didn’t crash already) and hope the problem is fixed when you reload the save.
[*]Godawful AI pathing. This isn’t much of a problem with enemies (in fact, it can be a big help when it does happen), but your allies are brain-dead dumb. This is especially bad in the game’s token escort mission, as the AI has genuine trouble trying to follow the path laid out for it. I saw the NPC I had to protect ram into a wall, do random U-turns, spend several minutes driving into a fire hydrant, and somehow get stuck hitting the very edge of a ruined car, which forced me to free him by running into him just when he was on the very edge of the car’s collision box. 
[*]An NPC that you must kill to proceed somehow disappearing. After some testing, I discovered that if the NPC (or any, for that matter) entered ragdoll mode for any reason in the level, he would fall through the floor and never return as part of a performance saving measure. This forced me to kill him ASAP, causing me to take a ridiculous amount of damage in the process and making things much harder than it should be.
[*]Multiple crashes when trying to protect Uwe Boll from a wave of hostile NPCs. 
[*]Not really a bug, but since it’s related to shitty design and programming, it goes here. One area featuring a gigantic firefight between three factions and random civilians running around. The issue is that the level is absolutely flooded with NPCs, which the poor engine can’t handle. Seriously, it has like 20 to 30+ characters doing their own things at once. Even people with strong CPUs will probably have trouble with this section.
[/list]
The cherry on top of this shit Sundae is poor sound mixing. Music and sound levels are inconsistent, leading to situations such as music that’s ridiculously loud while NPC chatter can barely be heard, despite having the same volume for sounds and music in the game’s options. At one point, I had to mute music entirely because it was close to blowing my eardrums out when it didn’t in previous levels. I never turned it on afterwards.

It’s not just music that has mixing problems either. Most weapons have sounds that aren’t too loud, but the M16 is ridiculously loud. While this is fine when only one person is using it, multiple characters using it feels like an assault on your eardrums. This makes enemies wielding the M16 the most dangerous enemy in the game; not because of the damage they do (which is sort of piddling), but for the fact they’re effective at directly attacking your IRL hearing abilities. I’ve never heard of a game where enemies are more effective hurting you IRL than in game, but Postal 3 manages to surprise and amaze.

As for good things, there are some fun weapons, such as the Machine Gun, and the graphics are pretty good for the time they were made in. The generic shooting segments are fun when there isn’t any BS in them. It’s not much, but it is something.

Overall, Postal 3 is a tremendous turd of a game and should be avoided. It fails at nearly everything it sets out to do. There are many reasons why the people that own the Postal IP, RWS, has disowned this game, despite their involvent in the game while it was being developed.","Let’s not beat around the bush: Postal 3 sucks.

[*]Godawful AI pathing. This isn’t much of a problem with enemies (in fact, it can be a big help when it does happen), but your allies are brain-dead dumb. This is especially bad in the game’s token escort mission, as the AI has genuine trouble trying to follow the path laid out for it. I saw the NPC I had to protect ram into a wall, do random U-turns, spend several minutes driving into a fire hydrant, and somehow get stuck hitting the very edge of a ruined car, which forced me to free him by running into him just when he was on the very edge of the car’s collision box. 
[*]An NPC that you must kill to proceed somehow disappearing. After some testing, I discovered that if the NPC (or any, for that matter) entered ragdoll mode for any reason in the level, he would fall through the floor and never return as part of a performance saving measure. This forced me to kill him ASAP, causing me to take a ridiculous amount of damage in the process and making things much harder than it should be.
[*]Multiple crashes when trying to protect Uwe Boll from a wave of hostile NPCs. 
[*]Not really a bug, but since it’s related to shitty design and programming, it goes here. One area featuring a gigantic firefight between three factions and random civilians running around. The issue is that the level is absolutely flooded with NPCs, which the poor engine can’t handle. Seriously, it has like 20 to 30+ characters doing their own things at once. Even people with strong CPUs will probably have trouble with this section.
[/list]
The cherry on top of this shit Sundae is poor sound mixing. Music and sound levels are inconsistent, leading to situations such as music that’s ridiculously loud while NPC chatter can barely be heard, despite having the same volume for sounds and music in the game’s options. At one point, I had to mute music entirely because it was close to blowing my eardrums out when it didn’t in previous levels. I never turned it on afterwards.

It’s not just music that has mixing problems either. Most weapons have sounds that aren’t too loud, but the M16 is ridiculously loud. While this is fine when only one person is using it, multiple characters using it feels like an assault on your eardrums. This makes enemies wielding the M16 the most dangerous enemy in the game; not because of the damage they do (which is sort of piddling), but for the fact they’re effective at directly attacking your IRL hearing abilities. I’ve never heard of a game where enemies are more effective hurting you IRL than in game, but Postal 3 manages to surprise and amaze.

As for good things, there are some fun weapons, such as the Machine Gun, and the graphics are pretty good for the time they were made in. The generic shooting segments are fun when there isn’t any BS in them. It’s not much, but it is something.

Overall, Postal 3 is a tremendous turd of a game and should be avoided. It fails at nearly everything it sets out to do. There are many reasons why the people that own the Postal IP, RWS, has disowned this game, despite their involvent in the game while it was being developed."

_Overhaul of the sound of weapons (Hace que las armas no suenen horrible).

+ Krew i brutalność
+ Arsenał
+ Gnojowaty, obrzydliwy i żałosny humor

+ The Dude's model, which I absolutely love
+ The Dude's voice, which I absolutely love
+ Blood and brutality
+ The arsenal
+ The filthy, disgusting, and pathetic humor
+ The soundtrack is pleasant to the ear
- Disgusting animations (e.g., in cutscenes)
- The effectiveness and accuracy of melee weapons (which are fucking nonexistent)
- Awkward controls that take a while to get used to
- Crappy optimization

[b]Postal III[/b] è il terzo capitolo della saga umoristica [i]Postal[/i] sviluppato dalla Akella (Акелла) in collaborazione con Trashmasters nel [b]2011[/b], non più ufficiale dopo il rilascio del quarto capitolo da parte della RWS.
-
Il gioco riscrive la parte finale di ""A Week in Paradise"", invece di scontrarsi contro il temibile Demone-Mucca, il [b]Postal Dude[/b], ora interpretato da Corey Cruise, si trova sul ponte che separa Paradise City dal resto dell'America, presidiato da forze militari che tentano di contenere l'epidemia zombie causata proprio dal protagonista. Fuggito dalla corruzione e dalla trasgressività del suo passato, troverà nuove possibilità nella tranquilla cittadina di ""Catharsis"", ma la sua natura malvagia e distruttiva è sempre in agguato, pronta ad uscire fuori ad ogni occasione.
-
[h1]PRO:[/h1]
✅ Divertente da giocare... quando parte.
✅ Trama, anche se scarna, più tridimensionale rispetto ai titoli precedenti.
✅ Arsenale ricco e variegato.
✅ Tenta di seguire l'onda di cambiamenti dei predecessori.

[h1]CONTRO:[/h1]
❌ Bug e Crash continui.
❌ Missioni ripetitive e banali.
❌ Sistema Karma imbarazzante e fallato.
❌ Nessun free-roaming in modalità storia.
❌ Humor di scarso livello.

[h1]FINALE:[/h1]
2011, lo sviluppo per il terzo capitolo di [b]Postal[/b] viene affidato alle due aziende Russe che riadattarono e censurarono i primi giochi originali della RWS per il mercato nazionale. In superficie possiamo dire che POSTAL III non è niente di meno che quello che ci si aspetterebbe: sboccato, pieno di humor nero, battute scarne, violenza gratuita e riferimenti sessuali di ogni tipo. La modalità di gioco segue la corrente del predecessore, ovvero cambia totalmente rispetto al capitolo precedente: nel primo caso (Postal / Postal: Redux) avevamo uno sparatutto a visuale isometrica, nel secondo un FPS stile Half-Life e con questo un TPS ad ondate, un genere che per via della sua natura ARENA richiede un sacrificio da parte della componentistica free-roaming. Ma quindi, qual'è il problema? Il problema di questo gioco è... il gioco:
Cali di frame-rate impressionanti, bug come se piovessero, armi inutili o mal funzionanti, missioni banali e ripetitive, humor di scarso livello e scelte Karma imbarazzanti.
Non c'è niente da fare, Postal può essere sviluppato da pochissime persone, Akella e Trashmasters non sono fra queste. La RWS ha deciso di rilasciare da poco [b]Postal 4: No Regerts[/b], non un grande titolo, pieno di problemi e poca originalità, ma sicuramente... non è [b]POSTAL III[/b].","[h1]POSTAL III[/h1]

[b]Postal III[/b] is the third installment in the humorous [i]Postal[/i] saga, developed by Akella (Акелла) in collaboration with Trashmasters in [b]2011[/b], no longer official after the release of the fourth installment by RWS.
-
The game rewrites the final part of ""A Week in Paradise"": instead of fighting the fearsome Cow Demon, the [b]Postal Dude[/b], now played by Corey Cruise, finds himself on the bridge separating Paradise City from the rest of America, guarded by military forces attempting to contain the zombie outbreak caused by the protagonist himself. Having escaped the corruption and transgression of his past, he will find new opportunities in the quiet town of ""Catharsis"", but his evil and destructive nature is always lurking, ready to emerge at any opportunity.
-
[h1]PROS:[/h1]
✅ Fun to play... when it gets going.
✅ Plot, though sparse, more three-dimensional than previous titles.
✅ Rich and varied arsenal.
✅ Attempts to follow the wave of changes from its predecessors.

[h1]CONS:[/h1]
❌ Constant bugs and crashes.
❌ Repetitive and banal missions.
❌ Embarrassing and flawed Karma system.
❌ No free-roaming in story mode.
❌ Poor humor.

[h1]FINAL:[/h1]
2011, development for the third installment of [b]Postal[/b] was entrusted to the two Russian companies that adapted and censored the first original RWS games for the domestic market. On the surface, we can say that POSTAL III is nothing less than what you'd expect: foul-mouthed, full of dark humor, lame jokes, gratuitous violence, and sexual references of all kinds. The gameplay follows the same trend as its predecessor, meaning it's completely different from the previous installment: in the first installment (Postal / Postal: Redux), we had an isometric shooter; in the second, a Half-Life-style FPS; and with this, a wave-based TPS, a genre that, due to its arena nature, requires a sacrifice in free-roaming components. So, what's the problem? The problem with this game is... the game:
Disturbing frame rate drops, profuse bugs, useless or malfunctioning weapons, banal and repetitive missions, low-quality humor, and awkward Karma choices.
There's nothing you can do about it; Postal could be developed by very few people; Akella and Trashmasters are not among them. RWS has recently decided to release [b]Postal 4: No Regerts[/b], not a great title, full of problems and little originality, but it's definitely... not [b]POSTAL III[/b]."

Where's the love for this title? Well kids, sit down and let me explain. Postal 3 was not developed by the same team as Postal 2. Postal 3 was outsourced to another company where it was worked on. Early releases showed something very promising and even top the previous title. However the months turned to years and soon Running With Scissors started asking where the product was. Finally one day with no time left, and a crowd quickly dying, Postal 3 was released unfinished. 

Yes kids, this title that has a good idea behind it and humor that pars with the movie and tops the previous title will never be seen in its entirety. When Postal 3 went out it quickly became known that the product was not finished. Glitches, broken achievements, missing features, the list seemed like it wouldn't end. Then eventually when Postal 3's title was trashed, Running With Scissors came out and put a very very far distance between themselves and the game, disowning it completely and Postal 3 fell into obscurity without love.

However the title does have its defenders like myself. When I first played Postal 3 ten years ago I felt that despite it being released in a late Beta stage it still did what it set out to do. To make you laugh and have fun. That is what I did, I laughed and I did have fun. There were some aggravation and even crashes, but I completed it and I did not regret it.

Postal 3 takes place shortly after the events of Postal 2's continuation Apocalypse Weekend. Now in a new town, Dude tries to scrap his life together for better (or worse) depending on your play style. Yes, this title does something unique, your actions effects certain events, and many events there are! Will you help your fellow town folk or create a repeat of Postal 2? The choice is yours! 

While having a choice, or moral system in place, Postal 3 has some interesting new weapons, enemies and the location is even fun to explore (note: you must complete the game to unlock free play from the level select) Postal 3 uses the (even at the time) horribly outdated Source engine from VALVe. This causes glitches on modern hardware that can be fixed up with some ease. Sadly this will not fix many issues such as some hit box detection, other glitches and broken achievements. 

Remember, this was released in a late Beta stage, so you can imagine some of the frustration you're going to run into. However if you look past that and look at the core idea of Postal 3, and take it in all its glitchy goodness, you will find a very fun and often funny title. Yes Postal 3, you are not unloved, you are just misunderstood. 

Folks, Postal 3 might not work for you, you may have to get patches, but I do beg you to look into it more. There's lots of laughs to be had in here. Is it better than Postal 2? Certainly not, and I don't think R.W.S. should have distanced themselves so quickly. Give it a chance, slow down and take it at face value as a late Beta game. Postal 3 is one of the most overlooked titles and it should be revisited.

Postal 3 je bohužel špatnou hrou, od které se distancovali i původní vývojáři Running With Scissors. Špatné až zbytečné mechaniky, ustavičné padání hry, záseky, bugy a plno dalšího jsou věci, které vám dokážou znechutit samotnou hru. Bohužel za mě tento titul nemůžu nikomu doporučit, ale je mi jasné, že Postal 3 má určitě i své fanoušky. Tento titul si můžete zakoupit na Steamu za 11,99 €.

Postal 3 is unfortunately a bad game, from which even the original developers of Running With Scissors distanced themselves. Bad and unnecessary mechanics, constant game crashes, lags, bugs and a lot more are things that can make you disgusted with the game itself. Unfortunately, I can't recommend this title to anyone, but it's clear to me that Postal 3 certainly has its fans. You can buy this title on Steam for €11.99.

""Postal III is a third-person shooter in which you… ehh… uhm…

Alright I’m going to level with you – don’t buy Postal III. Seriously, you’d regret it. Hell, you’d regret playing it for free. It’s a borderline-broken, boring, frustrating, unfinished mess, and there was nothing we could do stop it.

What happened is that we agreed to let a big Russian publisher develop and publish a third Postal game, which we would handle the design for. It was actually going well for the initial development time, but then the economy crashed especially hard in Russia and the project was handed to a smaller, less experienced team that didn’t have the skill or resources to make the game we designed, and they were forced to rush development to meet unreasonable deadlines. Corners were cut severely, dramatic changes to our design were made, and the game was put out in an unfinished barely-Alpha state. The game is simply unfinished and broken. And when it does work, the game is just boring and frustrating to play. The sad part is that the publisher made little-to-no effot to fix it themselves, nor did they ever give us access so that we could try patching it up for them. We are stuck with Postal III as it is.

You’re a responsible adult (we hope), so I’m sure you’re capable of making your own purchasing decisions. I just want you to consider all of the above, before you make the leap of regret into paying real hard-earned money for this title. We don’t own the game, we can’t support it and we don’t get anything from its sales, so if you decide to risk the purchase – you’re on your own.""

1.糟糕的操作与射击手感：动不动方向键错乱，而且还他娘是随机发生的，开枪开一半发现老子没法动了。并且持枪姿势像非洲大兵

2.“大聪明”AI：动不动跑反方向，或者百米加速撞墙，最傻逼的是护送骑车那个胖子那关，开着开着原地不动，好不容易快到了，TMD，这丫卡进地底，再不就是站着被塔利班突突，你开车跟着他，诶~他绕圈玩，艹！

3.不明意义的线性故事剧情，和单调重复性任务：有一说一，刚开始的善恶选择我觉得还挺不错的，不同选择不同分支，但单调的任务剧情就离谱，我TM好像玩的是保镖DUDE模拟器或“我如何用歪的没边的武器，剿灭暴徒基地大冒险” “我和吸尘器与卫生纸不得不说的故事”，而且全程就是突突突，各种突突突。妈的绝了！

4.少的可怜的武器与喝多了才能瞄准的准星：电击枪真挺不错，但M60和M16除了换弹速度以外我真没感受到区别，近战武器根本用不上，还有那离谱的胡椒喷雾，烧了半天，对面什么事情都没有，还有那睿智的眼神，仿佛在说“你是SB”

","After twenty hours, I finally beat this fucking piece of garbage! The reason I was able to play this piece of shit is because I bought the POSTAL XX 20th Anniversary Gift Pack on the RWS website. At the time, the website's recommendations told me to avoid this piece of shit. Ugh, guess what? I didn't believe it! (Inner thought: Damn! It's all POSTAL, isn't it? It's just a fun game, so what?) After playing it, I realized, WTF! Shit! Surprise!

1. Terrible controls and shooting: The direction keys kept messing up, and it was so random. I'd be stuck mid-fire when I'd start shooting. And he holds his gun like an African soldier.

2. ""Super Smart"" AI: Constantly running in the opposite direction or sprinting into a wall. The most idiotic level is the one where you're escorting the fat guy on a bike. You're driving and it's stuck in the same spot. You're almost there, but then it gets stuck underground. Or you're standing there getting shot at by the Taliban. You drive after it, and it's just going in circles. Fuck!

3. Nonsensical linear storyline and monotonous, repetitive missions: Honestly, I thought the good and evil choices at the beginning were pretty good, with different options leading to different paths. But the monotonous missions are ridiculous. It feels like I'm playing a bodyguard DUDE simulator or a ""How I Used My Stupid Weapons to Destroy a Gangster Base"" or ""The Story of My Vacuum Cleaner and Toilet Paper."" And it's just all gunfire, ... 4. The pitifully limited weapons and the aiming crosshairs that require a drunken streak: The stun gun is nice, but I can't really tell the difference between the M60 and the M16, aside from the reload speed. The melee weapon is completely useless, and that ridiculous pepper spray—it burns for ages, but the opponent doesn't react at all. And that wise look in my eyes seems to say, ""You're an idiot!""

Este juego es un desastre estelar; fue desarrollado por otra empresa, desapareció y reapareció en Steam y en 2020 se filtró su código fuente junto con el de Team Fortress 2 y Half-Life 2: Episode 2, provocando toda una parafernalia respecto a la seguridad de los servidores de TF2.

Plantea una dinámica de juego muy distinta, ahora fragmentada en misiones en contraposición al mundo abierto de su predecesor, algo que no es malo per se y que, de hecho, se hace valer por el sistema de valoración moral con el que podemos acabar desbloqueando distintas misiones. A su favor tengo para decir que Postal III entiende muy bien al sentido del humor que Running With Scissors expuso en Postal II.

Y hasta ahí queda todo lo bueno que se pueda decir de él; todo lo demás es una serie de escenarios apenas planteados para los tiroteos que allí ocurren, con coberturas inservibles, enemigos cuyos disparos traspasan las paredes, jefes que exigen demasiada precisión como para correr a una taza de fotogramas tan baja, música tan poco cohesiva que pareciera haber salido de distintas bandas sonoras, un espantoso menú de selección de armas (Que acaba siendo un espanto en caso de querer abrirlo durante un tiroteo) y escenarios carentes de conexión alguna.

Y el rendimiento no es su único problema ténico; correr consume una barra de estamina que en algunas ocasiones se bugea y deja de cargar por el resto de la misión, los NPCs corren en direcciones aleatorias durante un tiroteo y se ponen frente tuyo provocando que les dispares y pierdas puntos de reputación, y eso cuando no están repitiendo los mismos dos o tres diálogos, los efectos de sonidos son aquellos por defecto del motor Source, la cámara es inentendible al sprintear, en ocasiones los enemigos no reaccionan al ser atacados y tienden a hacer spawn frente al jugador.

Y todo esto si tenés suerte y no te crasheó, lo que ocurre al tirar un objeto, hacer alt+tab, abrir el menú de armas o simplemente al azar.

A nadie le sorprende que Running With Scissors acabe convirtiendo a Postal III en motivo de burlas, este juego fue producido por Akella y Trashmasters en medio de un conflicto legal, una crisis internacional y un desarrollo catastrófico que fue saltando entre varios equipos inexpertos y mal pagados. Tengo en mi blog personal mismo un artículo explicando toda la catástrofe que fue el desarrollo de Postal III, [url=https://valinypse.wordpress.com/2021/07/13/postal-3-desastre/]acá un enlace para los interesados[/url].

Hoy por hoy, el equipo de Running With Scissors recomienda a los usuarios en los foros de Steam no adquirir Postal III, estrenó una edición llamada ""Every Postal but that one"" que no incluía a este juego, publicaron una edición de vigésimo aniversario del primer juego que incluía una key de Postal III bajo una advertencia que dictaba ""WARNING: POSTAL 3 SUCKS, INSTALL AT YOUR OWN RISK"", hicieron un directo jugándolo en YouTube llamado ""MikeJ and Civvie11 Stream AIDS for your Steam Account… or POSTAL III“ y su sitio web te tira un Rickroll en caso de clickear en ""Postal III"".

[b]¿En conclusión?[/b] Encuentro poético que una franquicia caracterizada por el caos y el desastre cuente con un juego tan caótico y desastrozo que hasta a sus propietarios les de vergüenza.","[h1]Analytical Comment: ""Postal III""[/h1]

This game is a stellar disaster; it was developed by another company, disappeared, and reappeared on Steam. In 2020, its source code was leaked along with that of Team Fortress 2 and Half-Life 2: Episode 2, causing a whole commotion regarding the security of TF2's servers.

It offers a very different gameplay dynamic, now fragmented into missions as opposed to the open world of its predecessor, which isn't bad per se and, in fact, is reinforced by the moral rating system that allows us to unlock different missions. In its favor, I have to say that Postal III perfectly captures the sense of humor that Running With Scissors showcased in Postal II.

And that's all the good things that can be said about it; Everything else is a series of barely planned scenarios for the firefights that take place there, with useless cover, enemies whose shots pass through walls, bosses that require too much precision to run at such a low frame rate, music so incohesive it seems to have come from different soundtracks, a horrible weapon selection menu (which ends up being a nightmare if you try to open it during a firefight), and scenarios that lack any connection.

And performance isn't the only technical problem; running consumes a stamina bar that sometimes bugs and stops loading for the rest of the mission, NPCs run in random directions during a firefight and stand in front of you, causing you to shoot them and lose reputation points, and that's when they're not repeating the same two or three dialogues, the sound effects are the default ones from the Source engine, the camera is incomprehensible when sprinting, enemies sometimes don't react when attacked and tend to spawn in front of the player.

And all of this if you're lucky and it doesn't crash, which happens when you throw an item, alt-tab, open the weapons menu, or just randomly.

It's no surprise that Running With Scissors ended up making Postal III a source of ridicule. This game was produced by Akella and Trashmasters amid a legal dispute, an international crisis, and a catastrophic development process that bounced between several inexperienced and underpaid teams. I have an article on my personal blog explaining the entire development disaster of Postal III. [url=https://valinypse.wordpress.com/2021/07/13/postal-3-desastre/]here's a link for those interested[/url].

As of today, the Running With Scissors team is recommending users on the Steam forums not to purchase Postal III. They released an edition called ""Every Postal but that one"" that didn't include the game. They released a 20th anniversary edition of the first game that included a Postal III key under a warning that read ""WARNING: POSTAL 3 SUCKS, INSTALL AT YOUR OWN RISK."" They've done a YouTube stream of it called ""MikeJ and Civvie11 Stream AIDS for your Steam Account… or POSTAL III,"" and their website Rickrolls you if you click on ""Postal III.""

[b]In conclusion?[/b] I find it poetic that a franchise characterized by chaos and disaster has a game so chaotic and disastrous that even its owners are embarrassed."

В годы выхода получила отрицательные отзывы игроков, но если взглянуть максимально объективно, то здесь даже можно найти плюсы, хотя их крайне мало, и игру они вовсе не спасают. И тем не менее:
+Относительно современный движок
+Вытекающая из предыдущего пункта относительно приятная графика (хотя даже из этой версии Source можно выжать картинку лучше, как показал вышедший через год мод Black Mesa Source ко второй Half Life)
+На удивление неплохая шутерная составляющая. Оружие в целом хорошо ощущается, звуки стрельбы хорошие, оружие выглядит нормально, от неписей отрываются руки/ноги/голова (и даже есть анимации смерти из-за оторванных конечностей), всплески кровищи и прочих мозгов также приносят от стрельбы исключительно положительные эмоции (во второй части как была убогая шутерная механика, так она после многочисленных 13-ти летних апдейтов и заплаток такой и осталась, да и вообще не каждый ААА-шутер может похвастаться хорошей стрельбой)
+Арсенал игры довольно богат на разнообразное вооружение, а фантазия разработчика так и прёт со всех щелей. Помимо классических мачете и канистры с бензином, можно найти, например, вместо бензопилы - здоровенного барсука, который рвёт врагов на кровищу и кишки. Или например обезьяну, которая бегает за лазерной указкой, и по идее должна кидаться и орально насиловать/рвать в клочья голову того, на кого указка будет направлена. Также в качестве оружия можно использовать оторванные конечности. Правда есть ложка дёгтя (см. минусы)
+в целом сатирическая составляющая присутствует (экотеррористы, поехавшие от компьютерных игр задроты, феменистки, Джек Томпсон, которому сносят голову, Уве Болл, Сергей Мавроди, втюхивающий главному герою сами знаете какие бумажки в награду за выполнение задания и прочее отребье)
+В игре есть неплохие музыкальные композиции (писали их не разрабы)
+Выход игры забил последний гвоздь в крышку гроба такой паршивой конторы, как Akella Games, которая славилась, в первую очередь, своими убогими лоКАЛизациями популярных игр.

Минусы:
-оптимизация (если вы думаете, что эта игра у вас тормозит потому что у вас современный убер-компьютер, то не обольщайтесь - в те времена она также тормозила)
-цена (даже за 79 рублей на распродаже я всё таки побрезговал брать, сделав рефанд)
-куча багов - поломанные механики,  вылеты, лаги звуков, поломанные скрипты, которые не дают пройти уровень, застревающие враги, застревающие напарники, в целом игровой процесс ощущается так, будто всё это держится на соплях и честном слове генерального директора Акеллы (которое да, них*я не стоит), и будто всё это вот вот развалится и вылетит
-Арсенал хоть и богатый, но 80% оружия - мусор, и пользоваться вы будете, скорее всего, тремя-четырьмя слотами из условных 15. Вышеупомянутая обезьяна с лазерной указкой не работает (обезьяна игнорит указку и тупо бегает по карте), весь холодняк при попытке нанести удар даже не задевает врага, канистра с бензином работает в 3 из 10 случаях, в остальных - бензин из канистры льётся под землю, и физически его не существует, и поджечь его нельзя (ё*аный стыд)
-убогие квесты - собери кучу обконченных салфеток в дроч-клубе, собери миллион яблок, задержи 15 бомжей, используя электрошокер, загони обратно ё*аные сегвеи и прочее принеси-подай в худшей своей реализации, и повезет ещё если после очередной порции тягомотины квест не забагается и его получится закрыть. Хотя попадаются квесты где просто надо пройти по уровню и всех убить, в принципе они довольно терпимы, и то потому что стрелять относительно весело
-Нет открытого мира (добавили потом в виде заплатки, но он пустой и убогий)
-Игру разрабатывала Акелла

Слава богу что акелла больше не существует, но какой ценой она была уничтожена....",

Mais bon, j’étais certainement jeune et un peu c*n, et quelque part il y avait quelque chose d’assez jouissif dans la débauche de violence gratuite.

Ici, non seulement ce n’est pas un jeu bien branl*. Même s’il date de 2012 sur le moteur Source (Half Life 2 / CS), on pourrait déjà s’attendre à bien mieux que quelque chose qui ressemble plus à un mod non fini qu’autre chose.

L’introduction est pitoyable et donne déjà l’envie de se jeter par la fenêtre, la première mission suite le même chemin, et je n’ai pas eu le courage de terminer la deuxième, où il s’agissait de ramasser des chats pendants que des mariachis chinois m’attaquaient en vagues infinies tant que le nombre de chats n’est pas atteint. Sauf que pour les attraper il faut un objet consommable dont je n’ai aucune idée d’où en retrouver

Les armes ne sont pas ultra fun, la jouabilité pas au rendez-vous (typiquement l’aspersion d’essence qui ne fonctionne pas bien)…

But then again, I was certainly young and a bit of an idiot, and there was something quite enjoyable about the debauchery of gratuitous violence.

Not only is this not a particularly messed-up game. Even though it dates back to 2012 on the Source engine (Half Life 2 / CS), we could already expect much better than something that looks more like an unfinished mod than anything else.

The introduction is pathetic and already makes you want to throw yourself out the window. The first mission follows the same path, and I didn't have the courage to finish the second, where I had to pick up cats while Chinese mariachis attacked me in endless waves until the required number of cats was reached. Except that to catch them, you need a consumable item, which I have no idea where to find.

The weapons aren't very fun, the gameplay isn't up to scratch (typically the gasoline spray that doesn't work well)...

Postal 3 это странная игра, начнем с этого.
В техническом плане всё просто ужасно, но стоит только повозиться, привыкнуть, принять игру такой какая она есть.. и поверьте, вы получите тонну удовольствия от игры.
У Postal 3 так же есть один самый бесящий недостаток. Это ""кармаметр"".
То есть, вы убивая людей так сказать портите себе этот кармаметр, а это штука не так проста.
В Postal 3 нам придется часто выбирать, на чью сторону встать и как миссию пройти.
Дело в том, что с полностью красным кармаметром мы не сможем выйти на остальные миссии игры, и на хорошую концовку.
Это самый большой недостаток игры, который кстати можно и игнорировать, пройти игру мирно никого не убивая вполне возможно, вопрос лишь в том тот ли это Postal?
В любом случае, в остальном игра просто шикарна, как бы ее не поливали помоями в этой игре есть куча хорошего.

I don't regret anything.

Postal 3 is a weird game, let's start with that.
Technically, it's just awful, but once you tinker with it, get used to it, and accept the game for what it is, believe me, you'll have a ton of fun.
Postal 3 also has one very annoying flaw. It's the ""karma meter.""
Basically, by killing people, you ruin your karma meter, so to speak, and it's not that simple.
In Postal 3, we'll often have to choose which side to side with and how to complete missions.
The thing is, with a completely red karma meter, we won't be able to access the rest of the game's missions or the good ending.
This is the game's biggest flaw, which, by the way, can be ignored; it's entirely possible to complete the game peacefully without killing anyone. The only question is, is this the same Postal?
In any case, the rest of the game is simply amazing, no matter how much they trash it, there's a ton of good stuff in it.

Al juego lamentablemente le he visto solamente una cosa buena.
Esa cosa es el humor que maneja el juego y nuestro personaje. Tendremos grupos con sus estereotipos, como por ejemplo los frikis, las mujeres políticamente correctas, chinos que comen gatos, árabes, árabes vestidos de mexicanos, comunistas, hasta aparece Chavez. También habrá cosas bizarras, como los monos y gatos locos, nuestro perro que ataca a los huevos de las personas, árabes con sombreros de mexicano tratando de entrar a EEUU, etc. Postal Dude también tira frases como en sus anteriores juegos, mi favorita es ""le echo la culpa a los videojuegos"" la cual usa luego de cagar a tiros a una persona. 

Ahora pasaré a las cosas malas; para comenzar quiero decir que mataron totalmente la libre jugabilidad, la historia del juego es completamente lineal, sin embargo tendremos que en ciertos momentos elegir caminos (yo solo hice uno de ellos, el de ser policía), al lado del Postal 2 ese tipo de libertad es un chiste. 
El sistema de apuntado es muy malo, las balas no corresponden con la mira; la cámara es sobre el hombro, por lo tanto apuntaremos al estilo GTA, pero las balas van para cualquier lado, tendremos que tener una mejor puntería que en Counter Strike y un poco de suerte para que las balas vayan hacía donde vos queres. Hay ciertos momentos donde la puntería es algo critico y terminas disparandole a la persona equivocada por culpa del sistema de apuntado.
La optimización también es algo que no se logró para nada, el juego está hecho con el Source, sin embargo tuve unos importantes bajones de FPS.
El juego patinó mucho, no solo no logró la escencia del Postal 2, sino que también tuvo errores técnicos.","Postal 3 completely changed the formula.
Unfortunately, I've only seen one good thing about the game.
That good thing is the humor that the game and our character use. We'll have groups with their stereotypes, such as geeks, politically correct women, Chinese people who eat cats, Arabs, Arabs dressed as Mexicans, communists, and even Chavez. There will also be bizarre things, like crazy monkeys and cats, our dog who attacks people's balls, Arabs wearing Mexican hats trying to enter the US, etc. Postal Dude also throws out phrases like in their previous games; my favorite is ""I blame it on video games,"" which he uses after shooting someone.

Now, I'll move on to the bad things. To start, I want to say that they completely killed the free playability. The game's story is completely linear, however, we will have to choose paths at certain points (I only played one of them, being a police officer). Compared to Postal 2, that kind of freedom is a joke.
The aiming system is very poor; the bullets don't match the aiming target; the camera is over the shoulder, so we'll aim GTA-style, but the bullets go all over the place. We'll need better aim than in Counter-Strike and a little luck to get the bullets to go where we want. There are certain moments where aiming is critical, and you end up shooting the wrong person because of the aiming system.
Optimization is also something that wasn't achieved at all; the game is made with Source, however, I experienced significant FPS drops.
The game slipped a lot; not only did it not achieve the essence of Postal 2, but it also had technical errors."

a camera é estranha, não sei explicar mas a mira é uma droga e o jogo vive travando... meu pc roda jogo do ano passado sem problema nenhum e esse é de 10 anos atras quase!!! pra coroar alguns dos trofeus tão com problema
o humor idiota que tem no postal 2 tem nesse tambem mas ta pior. no dois é um negocio ruim que chega a ser bom mas nesse é ruim de ruim e sem graça... ok, tem algumas partes engraçadas ate mas não da... a pouca coisa boa nesse jogo não altera o monte de merda que é todo o resto
o jogo começa e cinco segundo depois uma cutscene imbecil, tu anda mais um segundo outra cutscene... se o jogo ainda fizesse alguma piada sobre isso seria hilario, mas não faz! as cutscenes são absurdamente irritantes e com um humor sem graça que chega a dar vontade de chorar até de tão ruim!!!
e parece que o jogo te joga missões completamente aleatorias, tipo ideias descartadas juntadas de qualquer jeito
 pode ate ser mais jogavel usando algum mod que mude a camera e a mira mas eu não tenho saco de ficar arrumando coisa que deveria ser arrumada com um update pelos desenvolvedores.

I gave it a chance... but I regretted it! It's terrible, it's crap, it's unplayable, it's irritating! And worst of all, it seems like it was made on purpose to be this way!!!!
The camera is weird, I can't explain it, but the aiming is terrible, and the game keeps crashing... My PC runs last year's game without any problems, and this one is almost 10 years old!!! To top it off, some of the trophies are broken.
The idiotic humor in Postal 2 is also present in this one, but it's worse. In Postal 2, it's a bad thing that's actually good, but in this one, it's terrible and unfunny... Okay, there are some funny parts, but it's not enough... The few good things in this game don't change the pile of shit that is everything else.
The game starts, and five seconds later, a stupid cutscene, you walk another second, another cutscene... If the game still made jokes about this, it would be hilarious, but it doesn't! The cutscenes are incredibly annoying and the humor is so unfunny it makes you want to cry it's so bad!!!
And it seems like the game throws you completely random missions, like discarded ideas thrown together haphazardly.
It might even be more playable with a mod that changes the camera and aim, but I can't be bothered to fix things that should be fixed with an update from the developers.

Fucking game... and I'm going to torture myself playing it again just to try to get the rest of the shitty trophies because I'm a loser!!"

Начинал я своё знакомство с Postal 2. Игру крайне оценил. Много ужасного слышал про третью часть (даже от самих разработчиков). Все в один голос говорили, что игра ужасна. И в какой-то момент мне стало интересно самому оценить этот ""ужас"" :)
Прошёл игру два раза (два пути) и вы можете подумать, что я извращенец, но эта часть мне понравилась. Игра оказалась не так плоха. Я даже получил от неё удовольствие и она подняла мне настроение.

Да, это не Postal 2 со своим открытым миром и геймплеем в стиле песочницы. Да, тут достаточно много багов (чего стоят частые вылеты из игры при использовании гранаты). Техническая сторона у Postal 3 хромает. Оружие не всегда бьёт туда, куда нужно. Не всегда срабатывают нужные действия. Крайне неудобный выбор оружия (приходится ломать голову, какое на какую кнопку назначить, чтобы было удобно). Да и при всём разнообразии, к сожалению, разным видом вооружения особо нет смысла пользоваться, так как возможны вылеты игры, или банально не получится воспользоваться определённым вооружением из-за его кривизны. Потому лично я всегда ходил только с огнестрелом (пистолет, М16, пулемёт).
Ну, это я о минусах. Теперь хочется пояснить за то, что понравилось.

В отличии от второй части, здесь более внятный сюжет в стиле фильма Уве Болла. Абсурдные события, которые происходят с Чуваком, накал безумия и порочности, что происходит в Катарсисе, поднятие до сих пор актуальных социальных проблем. Всё это вместе высмеивает порочное общество. Да, ролики не самого хорошего качества (особенно эффект плёнки под конец начинает надоедать), юмор бывает плосковат (вспоминается школьный юмор), но в целом всё это вызывало у меня улыбку, а иногда и смех в голос "":D Озвучка Куража Бомбея для русских пользователей так вообще сильно решает. Этот человек может придать колорита в образы персонажей.
Сюжет может показаться расплывчатым (я не отрицаю, что вероятно здесь особо с ним не заморачивались), но по итогу получилось что-то на уровне Гая Ричи, когда в начале не понимаешь, что происходит, а по итогу все события имеют смысл и объединяются в общую картину. В данном случае, довольно абсурдную картину, но от того и смешнее.

Хочется отметить довольно приятную графику. Для 2011 года отлично. Особенно я оценил ощущения от стрельбы. Отдача, мощные звуки (да-да, классические Source звуки, но подано как-то особенно). Как можно выстрелами отстрелить голову, части тела. Действительно ощущаешь, что стреляешь из чего-то мощного.

Итог.
Игра и впрямь довольно сырая в техническом плане и слегка криво сделана в плане подачи происходящего. Но повидав более ужасные игры, как по мне Postal 3 получилась довольно добротной, если рассматривать её со стороны социальной сатиры и перестрелок. Да, это не Postal 2, но мне бы хотелось причислить эту часть к общему канону Postal.
Я не могу рекомендовать эту игру многим, но если вам понравился фильм Уве Болла, то думаю вы оцените эту часть ;)","I'd like to write at least something in support of this game.
I started my journey with Postal 2. I absolutely loved it. I'd heard a lot of terrible things about the third game (even from the developers themselves). Everyone unanimously said the game was terrible. And at some point, I became interested in experiencing this ""horror"" for myself :)
I've completed the game twice (two paths), and you might think I'm a pervert, but I liked this part. The game wasn't that bad. I even enjoyed it, and it lifted my spirits.

Yes, it's not Postal 2 with its open world and sandbox gameplay. Yes, it has a lot of bugs (for example, frequent crashes when using a grenade). Postal 3's technical side is weak. The weapons don't always hit where they're supposed to. The intended actions don't always work. The weapon selection is extremely inconvenient (you have to rack your brain trying to figure out which button to assign to which for ease of use). And despite all the variety, unfortunately, there's little point in using different types of weapons, as the game can crash, or you simply can't use certain weapons due to their curvature. So, personally, I always carried only firearms (pistol, M16, machine gun).

Well, that's about the downsides. Now I'd like to elaborate on what I liked.

Unlike the second game, this one has a more coherent plot, in the style of a Uwe Boll film. The absurd events that befall the Dude, the intensity of the madness and depravity that unfolds in Catharsis, and the raising of still-relevant social issues. All of this together satirizes a corrupt society. Yes, the cutscenes aren't the best quality (especially the film effect gets tiresome towards the end), and the humor can be a bit flat (reminds me of school humor), but overall, it all made me smile, and sometimes even laugh out loud. :D The voice acting for Bombay Courage is a huge plus for Russian users. This guy can really add flavor to the characters.
The plot may seem vague (I don't deny that they probably didn't put much thought into it), but the end result is something on the level of Guy Ritchie, where at first you don't understand what's going on, but by the end, everything makes sense and comes together to form a coherent picture. In this case, it's a rather absurd picture, but that makes it funnier.

I'd like to point out the rather pleasing graphics. Excellent for 2011. I especially appreciated the feel of the gunfire. The recoil, the powerful sounds (yes, classic Source sounds, but presented in a unique way). How can you shoot away at someone with just one shot? Head, body parts. You really feel like you're shooting something powerful.

Bottom Line.
The game is indeed quite crude technically and a bit poorly executed in terms of presentation. But having seen worse games, I think Postal 3 is quite solid, considering its social satire and shootouts. Yes, it's not Postal 2, but I'd like to include this installment in the overall Postal canon.
I can't recommend this game to many, but if you liked Uwe Boll's film, I think you'll appreciate this one. ;)"

Сколько же раз я слышал, что [b]Postal 3[/b] ужасная игра. Сколько было недовольства во время выхода и отрицательных обзоров. Даже сейчас можно ужаснуться посмотрев на рейтинг в [b]Steam.[/b] Игра была отдана русским разработчикам под закат российской игровой индустрии и не нужно быть прорицателем, что бы понять какого тёмно-коричневого цвета она получилась. Правда купив ее буквально за копейки и пройдя за 4 часа, могу сказать ну не такая она и отвратительная, играть можно, хоть местами и жутко неприятно. Проектов более отвратительного качества навалом, а для ознакомления она вполне подойдет, как раз для тех кто пропустил в свое время.

Фирменный юмор и трэш никуда не делись, другое дело, что сделано все особенно в техническом плане спустя рукава. Она тормозит, вылетает, анимации очень кривые, миллион багов и все вытекающие отсюда последствия. С первой заставки видна малая опытность разработчиков практически во всех деталях. Хоть в качестве движка был выбран [b]source[/b] как его так можно было убить (количество багов) один большой вопрос? С другой стороны, получили вполне хорошую графику с приятными текстурами и неплохими уровнями. Даже спустя столько лет смотрится не противно. Камера переехала за спину всё того же [i]Чувака[/i] и по мне так даже лучше. А вот открытого мира игра лишились. Точнее во время заданий по-прежнему можно бегать, стрелять во всех и устраивать геноцид, но доступные районы очень маленькие и основное действия происходят по сюжету. Я не шибко любил носиться по большой карте второй игры в поисках всякого, однако тут прям чувствуешь себя в клетке. Вас теперь прямо за ручку ведут от миссии к миссии и просят делать что-то отвратное. Кидаться салфетками после мастурбации, воровать сигвеи, защищать [i]Уве бола[/i] от хейтеров и т.д. Цели то вроде неплохие и заставки порой забавные, однако всё сводится к монотонности. От этого сильно пострадало разнообразие, не так много оружия и способов поиздеваться, а продолжительность даже по нынешним меркам просто смешная. Правда все ключевые вещи сохранили - кошку в роли глушителя или возможность облить кого-то бензином и поджечь. Да тут по прежнему можно ссать, во многих играх есть такое?

На русскую озвучку позвали [i]Дениса «Кураж-Бамбей»,[/i] определенно вам понравится если вы его любите, но диалоги зачитаны монотонно, звук порой хрипит, даже такой жирный плюс для русских игроков запороли. Задания вроде и неплохие, но не блещут, убей этих, убей тех, чаще скучно. Возможно время такого геймплея просто ушло, бегать и стрелять во всех не приносит уже такого кайфа. Возможно мы, как и игровая индустрия повзрослели. Несмотря на неплохой дизайн уровней игра годится чисто пробежать и забыть. Сценарий будто давит шоколадку, но порой все-таки может улыбнуть. Если бы еще концовка была нормальная, а не полная чепуха, возможно общие впечатления сложились получше. Истории, классных диалогов, ничего тут нет т.к. из игры скорее вышел фанфик от фанатов. В любом случае она не такая ужасная, есть куча проектов куда хуже, но и искать чего-то прям крутого здесь не стоит. Если у вас есть свободный вечер и желание ознакомиться с крупным провалом десятилетней давности – вполне сойдёт.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2342031448
How many times have I heard that [b]Postal 3[/b] is a terrible game? There was so much discontent upon release and so many negative reviews. Even now, looking at the Steam ratings is horrifying.[/b] The game was handed over to Russian developers at the end of the Russian gaming industry, and you don't need a prophet to understand how dark it turned out. However, having bought it for next to nothing and completed it in four hours, I can say it's not that terrible; it's playable, even if it's terribly unpleasant in places. There are plenty of projects of worse quality, but this one is perfectly suitable for a quick introduction, just right for those who missed it. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2342031384
The signature humor and trash are still there, but the technical work is particularly poor. It lags, crashes, the animations are incredibly clunky, there are a million bugs and all the ensuing consequences. From the very first splash screen, the developers' lack of experience is evident in almost every detail. Even though [b]source[/b] was chosen as the engine, how could they have ruined it like that (the number of bugs) is one big question. On the other hand, we got quite good graphics with nice textures and decent levels. Even after all these years, it doesn't look bad. The camera has moved behind the same [i]Dude[/i] and, in my opinion, it's even better. The game, however, has lost its open world. More precisely, during missions, you can still run around, shoot everyone, and commit genocide, but the accessible areas are very small, and most of the action takes place according to the story. I wasn't a big fan of running around the second game's large map searching for things, but here you really feel like you're in a cage. You're now led by the hand from mission to mission and asked to do disgusting things. Throwing napkins after masturbating, stealing Segways, protecting [i]Uwe Boll[/i] from haters, etc. The objectives are decent, and the cutscenes are sometimes funny, but everything boils down to monotony. This has greatly reduced the variety; there aren't many weapons or ways to torment yourself, and the length is laughable even by today's standards. True, all the key features are still there, like the cat as a muffler or the ability to douse someone with gasoline and set them on fire. You can still pee here, right? How many games have that? https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2342031297
[i]Denis ""Kurazh-Bambey""[/i] was invited to do the Russian voiceover. You'll definitely like it if you like him, but the dialogue is monotonous, the sound is sometimes hoarse, and even this big plus for Russian players was ruined. The missions are decent, but they're not particularly exciting. Kill this, kill that, and it's often boring. Perhaps that kind of gameplay is simply over; running around and shooting at everyone isn't as satisfying anymore. Perhaps we, like the gaming industry, have matured. Despite the decent level design, the game is best played straight through and forgotten. The plot feels like it's squeezing out a chocolate bar, but it still manages to make you smile at times. If the ending had been more realistic and not complete nonsense, the overall impression might have been better. There's no story, no great dialogue, nothing here, as the game is more like a fan-made fanfic. It's not terrible, by any means; there are plenty of projects that are far worse, but you shouldn't look for anything truly amazing here. If you have a free evening and want to check out a major failure from ten years ago, it's fine.

Но! Скажу честно, в какой-то мере, некоторые аспекты показались мне частично увлекательными и даже захватывающими. Для франшизы как Postal, RPG элемент хорошего / плохого прохождения с нелинейностью, это неожиданный и умный ход. Все от первой до последней миссии это жвачка, а персонаж главного героя малость излишне комичен нежели в старой доброй второй части; но с другой стороны забавный Кураж-Бамбей. А вот говорить о игровом процессе сложно, ведь он трагичен и с этим ничего не поделать: будь то сражение с военными или кем-то ещё, это банальное закликивание с мучительными недоработками разработчика.

Тем не менее, если бы те кто создавал данный проект довели бы его до ума и завершили его куда более адекватным и профессиональным образом, быть может эта игра могла бы претендовать на звание неплохого трэша, но в таком виде это мусор.

reVote 4/10","€2.50 is the price I paid for Postal 3, and I can modestly say that's the most it's worth.

But! I'll be honest, to some extent, I found some aspects partially engaging and even captivating. For a franchise like Postal, the RPG element of good/bad progression with nonlinearity is an unexpected and clever move. Everything from the first to the last mission is a joke, and the protagonist's character is a little overly comical compared to the good old second game; on the other hand, Courage-Bombay is funny. It's difficult to talk about the gameplay, however, because it's tragic and there's nothing you can do about it: whether it's a battle with the military or anyone else, it's banal clickbait with painful developer flaws.

However, if the people who created this project had polished it up and completed it in a more adequate and professional manner, perhaps this game could have been a decent trash game, but as it stands, it's trash.

Андрей Белкин и его команда прыгнули выше своей головы и многократно превзошли свои предыдущие блокбастеры: ""Бой с тенью"" и ""Меченосец"". Смерть других проектов Акеллы ""Приключения капитана Блада"" и ""Аксли Рейдж"" определённо стоили выхода этой игры. Впрочем, после релиза Postal III в след за ними в могилу канула и сама Акелла, а самые худший кошмар Белкина, потерять работу после релиза, стал явью. За столь короткое время разработчики успели выпустить лишь 2 патча и этого оказалось очень мало - игра всё ещё частенько вылетает, особенно при бросках гранат/молотовых/кошек и прочего мусора. Однако, умельцы-мододелы из WhackJob Interactive не так давно сообщили, что им удалось исправить почти все эти баги и косяки, так что ждём их мод Catharsis Reborn, ну и возможно фикс для самой ваниллки.","Arguably Trashmasters' finest creation. Andrey Belkin and his team outdid themselves and surpassed their previous blockbusters, ""Shadowboxing"" and ""Swordsman."" The deaths of Akella's other projects, ""The Adventures of Captain Blood"" and ""Axley Rage,"" were certainly worth the release of this game. However, after the release of Postal III, Akella itself followed suit, and Belkin's worst nightmare—losing his job after the release—came true. In such a short time, the developers managed to release only two patches, and that was far from enough—the game still crashes frequently, especially when throwing grenades, molotov cocktails, grappling hooks, and other junk. However, the skilled modders at WhackJob Interactive recently announced that they've managed to fix almost all of these bugs and glitches, so we're looking forward to their Catharsis Reborn mod, and perhaps a fix for vanilla itself."

-6'ncısı, neden can barına benzer birşey yok, oyunda canımızın azaldığını ekranın renk değiştirmesi ile farkediyoruz ancak bu renk değiştirme çok yetersiz kalıyor.
-7'ncisi, bu oyunda neden öncelik olarak ekran kartı yerine işlemci kullanılıyor, oyun optimizasyonu bir garip olmuş.
-8'incisi, neden son göreve kadar tüm oyunu kolay yapıp son görevi çok zorladınız sinir krizi geçirecektim.

Нельзя настраивать отдельно громкость звуков, голосов и видео - всё в одном ползунке. Звуки выстрела автомата всего один. Повторяющийся, заедающий саундтрек в миссиях длящихся намного больше, чем сам саундтрек.

You can't adjust the volume of sounds, voices, and video separately – everything is in one slider. There's only one machine gun shot sound. The soundtrack is repetitive and annoying in missions that last much longer than the soundtrack itself.
Broken crosshair. Half the time, it shoots in the wrong direction, no matter what the camera angle.

Decent dismemberment, a good plot, interesting characters, a godlike soundtrack, and Courage Bombay's awesome voice acting in the spirit of old MTV movies.

Of course, there are some downsides, like crashes and dumb AI, but I've played through the game several times and still nothing.

And none of that is present in Postal 4.
What the developers have been doing all these three years, I don't know.
They themselves trashed the third game, and in the end, it turned out to be much better than the fourth.
Ironic.

If you have to choose between 3 and 4, choose 3.
Although I don't give a damn what you play, do whatever you want.
Well, I'm looking forward to Brain Damaged, from the new developers; I think they won't let me down."

Mission 0 - Tutorial across a bridge - simple but the constant cutaways ruin the level and pacing.
Mission 1 - Collect tissues off the floor of a porn shop, use them on soccer moms - The aim is horrible and they do not fly.
Mission 2 - Collect 15 cats infected with HIV - Your given catnip and a small city block to explore this. Eventually being chased by owners of a chinese restaurant because they feel your encroaching on their territory.
Mission 3 - Body guard duty - Your told not to kill people but you need to in order to advance the story. Kill 15 soccer moms while cops are shooting at you then kill 10 cops - Waste of time.
Mission 4 - Kill cops or kill ectotologists - I killed the cops. Eventually cops turn into swat and a helicopter spawns. The hitbox for the helicopter or the aim reticle is off. I don't know which. Either way its a striaght fight of find the weak spot, shoot, hide to regen health, pop out to empty 2 clips, repeat. 
Mission 5 - Ectologists - Vacuum apples off of a tree for about 5 minutes then get assaulted by al qaeda. Kill 20 of them, accidently kill 1 ectologist, have to kill 19 more.
Mission 6 - kill 20 chinese restaurant workers.
Mission 7 - Repo 7 segways - Kill the people on them, drive them back. The longest part is running there and back.
Mission 8 - Escort a male sex slave out of city hall. Kill the paparazzi. The cinematics around this mission are longer then the mission.
Mission 9 - Open 30 (maybe 25?) cages, in groups of 3. Then run and kill a boss. Youll spend more time running to the boss down hallways then killing it.
Mission 10 - repeat map of 7, kill the other segway people (gay cowboys), then drive to the mall.
Mission 11 - Run through the mall and drop toys off. Thats it. Nothing special.
Mission 12 - Find the pharmacy, throw footballs over the fence, kill a few people - this took a while because the cutscene makes the footballs look like they are by the fence. They are not.
Mission 13 - Escort mission. Move to far away and fail the mission. Also you can accidently headshot the person. And then fail.

''Postal Dude'' ikinci oyunun sonunda Paradise'ı nükleer bombayla havaya uçurduğundan dolayı bir yandaki kasabaya, ''Catharsis''e göç eder. Dude, kasabaya girdiğinde cebinde parası olmadığı için bir depo benzin dahi alamaz ve orada mahsur kalır. Tek yapması gereken, ona para kazandıracak bir iş bulmak ve derhal bu kasabayı terk etmektir. Dude, karşısına çıkan seçenekleri değerlendirmeli ve kendi yolunu çizmelidir.

[b] HİKAYE ANLATIMI VE SUNUM [/b]

Açılışta, komik bir dış ses bize hikayeyi anlatıyor ve bu anlatı yeterince iyi çizilmiş karikatürler ile destekleniyor. Fakat bu yöntemi uzunca bir süre daha görmüyoruz, ta ki oyunun sonuna kadar. Hikaye mizah, popüler kültür eleştirisi, ırkçılık, terörizm, erotizm, politika, tarikatlar ve bilumum şeyler ile destekleniyor. Fakat oyunda bir alt yazı bulunmamakta ve bu durum hikaye anlatımı açısından çok büyük bir eksi. Bunların yanı sıra hikaye ile bağlantılı olarak, çeşitli popüler oyunlara da mizahi göndermeler bulunmakta.

[b] OYNANIŞ MEKANİKLERİ VE GÖREV ÇEŞİTLİLİĞİ [/b]

İlk oyun izometrik bakış açısı, ikinci oyun FPS, üçüncü oyun ise TPS olarak karşımıza çıkmakta. Bu durum çeşitlilik açısından hoş fakat yapımcı firma [i] (Running Witch Scissors kendi yapmak yerine Trashmasters adındaki çömez bir ekibe yaptırmış.) [/i] kamera açılarını çok iyi yapamamış. Karakter kontrolleri pek iyi hissettirmiyor, çok yavan. İkinci oyunda olduğu gibi bu oyunda da bir çok yakın dövüş silahı, [i] (Kürek, çivili sopa, balta, pala, jop, balyoz ve saldırgan porsuk.) [/i] ateşli silahlar [i] (Tabanca, M-16, roketatar, minigun ve pompalı silah.) [/i] ve fırlatılabilirler [i] (Bomba, molotof, arı yuvası, Krotchy oyuncağı, susturucu olarak kullanılabilen kediler ve maymunlar) [/i] bulunmakta. Görevler [i] (Spermli peçete temizleme görevi, politik görevler, ırkçı Usame bin Ladin görevleri, tarikatlar, popüler kültür göndermeleri görevler vs.) [/i] ise oyunun mizahi ruhuna oldukça uygun. Fakat görev dizaynı konusunda oyuncunun elinden tutmak yerine köstek olmayı seçmişler. Örneğin; kedi toplama görevinde bir hata yüzünden yaklaşık bir saat takıldım ve kendiliğinden çözüldü. Bunların yanı sıra oyunun sonu etkileyen seçimler var. Örneğin; bir görevde size iki seçenek sunuluyor, eğer birini seçerseniz iyi ya da kötü bir şey yapmış oluyorsunuz, eğer ikisinide seçmezseniz kendi yolunuzda ilerliyorsunuz. Buna göre oyun üç adet son [i] (İyi, kötü ve kendi yolunuzu seçtiğiniz son.) [/i] ile bitiyor. 

[b] ANİMASYONLAR, ARA SAHNELER VE FİZİK [/b]

Karakter ve çevre animasyonları bir amatörün elinden çıktığını belli edecek kadar sırıtıyor fakat bu durum oyun esnasında çok göze batmıyor. Zaten animasyonların kötü olduğunu bildikleri için ara sahnelerde karakterleri çok haraket ettirmeden, sadece diyaloglar üzerinden kullanmışlar. Oyun fiziklerine gelecek olursak, oldukça başarılı olmuş. Düşmanların parçalanan vücutlarını elimize alıp fırlatabiliyor, çevredeki objeler ile etkileşime geçebiliyoruz. Bunun yanı sıra oyunun motoru ''Source Engine'' olmasına rağmen optimizasyon [i] (Beşten fazla adam öldürdüğünüzde oyunda takılmalar, donmalar başlıyor.) [/i] berbat, yükleme süreleri uzun ve oyundan atma sorunları var.

[b] MÜZİKLER VE SES [/b]

Müziklerin berbat olmasının yanı sıra bir de olur olmadık yerde çalmaları çok kötü bir seçim olmuş. Hiçbiri akılda kalmıyor aksine kulak tırmalıyor. Karakter seslendirmeleri Postal Dude'un ve birkaç ana karakterin dışında çok kötü.

[b] SONUÇ [/b]

Eğer Postal serisini çok seviyorsanız, filmini izlediyseniz ve her oyununu oynarım diyorsanız tavsiye ederim. Fakat eğlenmelik, akıcı ve optimize bir postal oyunu arıyorsanız sizi 2. oyuna buyur edelim. Bu oyun seriyi sevenler ve tamamını oynamak isteyenler için. İndirim dönemlerinde 4 lira oluyor. Zaten bu oyuna daha fazlası verilmez. Oyunu mizahı bir nebze olsun kurtarıyor ve ben sırf bunun hatırına oynayıp inceledim.

It definitely has its problems. It’s extremely linear, you can’t free roam between missions (only after beating the game), it can crash seemingly at random (I've experienced numerous crashes due to throwing objects, though it doesn't happen too often) and I'm fairly certain the aiming is slightly off (it’s not hard to adjust to it though).

Personally, I think £8.99 is a bit much, but if you ever see it on sale, and you're a fan of the other Postal games, I don’t really see the harm in giving it a try","So I originally bought this game as a joke (and also my impulsive need to own every Postal game).

Then came the discussion of Postal 3. All the negative reviews, all the YouTube commentary and satire just increase my curiosity and desire to reach a single conclusion;

"" How bad can it possibly be? "" 

The short answer is, "" Not that bad at all ""

Postal 3's biggest flaw is that it's labeled a Postal game. Understandable so considering RWS owns the Postal property, Madcow MikeJ voiced a character, Desi had a voice gig in it as well and, obviously, it's called Postal 3. However, this is NOT a postal game by any stretch of the imagination. 

Postal 3 is a buggy circus. A carnival of glitches and a celebration of trash that no one wanted but needs to experience at least once in their life. It's for those who laugh at Z movies for how bad it really is. It's for those of us who have an appreciate for trash entertainment. * Not to be confused with sleazy entertainment, which this game does have it's own sleazy moments *

GAMEPLAY: 

It's lame, but that's where its charm is. You don't buy a Postal game for outstanding game play. You're here simply to kill random people, pee on everything, blow it up, and then move on with your life. It's a sigh of relief for the working mans spirit. It's the opportunity to lash out without any penalty of law or social unrest. The ability to choose a path

 * Which was one of the biggest beefs Postal fans had with the game. One of about a million, that is * 

gives the player a chance to have some re-playability with this. Running errands, doing jobs, never getting paid and always finding yourself with the short end of the stick is the name of this game. Oh, and you get to kill from time to time when you're not leaning on your taser or pepper spray. Or you can just "" Postal "" and run wild on the bad path. The choice is up to you. I will say, the game play is pretty short. I did a run in 6 hours. 

I did like the variety of weaponry at your disposal. A few are useless, a few are novelty items and a few are your bread and butter * We can thank DOOM for that *

I've heard complaints about the aiming in this game, and that does stand true. The aim is off slightly but I, personally, had no issues popping off head shots in the game with an M16 or the pistol. 

STORY: 

Did you really expect one to begin with? What'd Carmack say about stories in games? Moving on. 

GRAPHICS:

It's decent and some things can look okay. Then again, Postal was never huge on graphics now was it? 

PERFORMANCE: 

This is where I have my biggest pet peeve, because this game isn't exactly what I'd consider "" Demanding "", but it does love to act like it is. Stutters, frame rate drops, and enough crashes to send any insurance agent into a spiral of madness. 

Is it still playable? YES - It only crashed on me 4 times in a single play through. 

FINAL THOUGHTS:

As I said previously, this game's BIGGEST flaw is that it's labeled a Postal game. This is NOT a postal game. This is a Wal-Mart roll back bargain bin European rip off of a Postal game. This game is for those of us who enjoy a train wreck. This is for those of us who are inclined to sit through Plan 9 From Outer Space because of just how horribly bad it is. This game is trash, but that's its only saving grace.

I don't like the fact that RWS doesn't see a dime from this but what can you do, right? 

Is it fun? Yes
Is it entertaining? Yes
Was it worth the $12+ dollars I spent on it? Yes
Is it re-playable? I'd say so, considering you can choose a Good or Bad path.

3. Плохой прицел, надо для точности подымать повыше.
4. Озвучка хороша, но слух режет напалмом.

в итоге она меня увлекла и понравилась гораздо больше, чем признанные фанатами серии дополнения к Посталу 2!
сравним, начну с минусов:
- баги и краши присутствуют ровно в таком же количестве, как и во второй части (при этом по пути зла игра прошла ровно, а по пути добра иногда вылетала)
- взаимодействие с окружающим миром на таком же низком уровне, как и во второй части (хотя тут можно подбирать и кидаться мусором и человеческими головами, например)
- - действительно, игру не отполировали перед выходом по известным причинам (но ничего критического и непроходимого нет)
что понравилось:
+ саундтрек отличный
+ графика современнее и приятнее глазу
+ новые фишки типа сегвеев, пары видов оружия, обезьянок и т.д.
+ + игра очень динамична, но при этом есть возможность исследовать локации, а после прохождения сюжета доступен режим свободного перемещения (кто говорил, что в игре нет открытого мира?!)
+ + выбор сторон: теперь мы не просто можем выбрать убивать/не убивать, но ещё и выбрать за кого нам убивать или не убивать, при этом миссии и сюжет будут меняться в зависимости от нашего выбора!
+ + юмор и озвучка от Кураж Бамбея, лично для меня это огромный плюс!
итог: это очень достойное продолжение серии Постал, в нём так же в виде сатиры и чёрного юмора освещаются острые социальные проблемы. геймплэй стал гораздо динамичнее! реиграбельность достигается не только разными способами выполнения миссий, но и разветвлённым сюжетом. лично я перестал замечать недостатки в физике игры и принял её такой, какой она есть, так захватило меня действие, в то время как даже Постал 2 местами был скучноват, а Потерянный Рай вообще рядом не стоит!",

о минусах:
1) Конченная оптимизация.
2) Кривейшее управление - пылесос, мачете и все прочее из всего только огнестрел по прицелу работает.
3) Вид от третьего лица - неплохое решение, да вот неудобно это нихера.
4) Озвучка - тут как по вкусу, но вот мне Кураж бомбей вот вообще не нравится, а замешать это со скрипами и фоном - так такое ощущение будто я на толчке сижу.
5) Выбор добра и зла - да, прикольное решение, да вот мало кто захочет в трэшовой игре такое как постал не воспользоваться хотябы БАРСУКОМ-БЕНЗОПИЛОЙ, чтобы не пожрать пару прохожих.
6) Сюжет - слит...шутки во второй части были куда красочнее.
7) Что больше всего побесило - это вылеты, бесспрерывные, поиграл часик/полчасика - вылетело, подождал 5 минут пока все опять запустится и по старой схеме, еле хватило нервов закрыть все ачивки, да кстати о них...
8) Кривые ачивки - сделай как тут написано, а по факту я имел в виду другое и так было 3 проблемы с достижениями из-за которых приходилось постоянно перезагружать сохранение.

Итог - серия постал - легендарная и очень топовая, но про третью часть увы так никогда не скажешь 100500 вылетов из 10 - по другому и не описать лучше.","Well then... I SHIT 3 - the world has never seen such crap))
About the cons:
1) Complete optimization.
2) Terrible controls - the vacuum cleaner, machete, and everything else only work when aiming.
3) Third-person view - not a bad solution, but it's just so damn inconvenient.
4) Voice acting - it's a matter of taste, but I don't like Courage Bombay at all, and combined with the creaking and background noise, it feels like I'm sitting on the toilet.
5) The choice of good and evil - yeah, a cool solution, but few people would want that in a trashy game, so I started not to at least use the BADGER-CHAINSAW to avoid eating a couple of passersby.
6) The plot is a bust... the jokes in the second game were much more colorful.
7) What annoyed me the most were the constant crashes. I'd play for an hour or half an hour, then it crashed, waited 5 minutes for everything to restart, and then, as usual, I barely had the nerve to complete all the achievements. Speaking of which...
8) The achievements are crooked - make them as written here, but I actually had something else in mind, and there were three achievement issues that required me to constantly reload my save.

The bottom line is that the series is legendary and very top-notch, but unfortunately, I can't say the same about the third game: 100,500 crashes out of 10 - there's no other way to describe it."

It turned into something different from what it was supposed to be, It has bugs and issues, But it's playable, or at least for me..

I had fun playing it, But it's not a game for most people due to the issues you will encounter, and sometimes half arsed game play.

The good:
- Humour, it is so bad that it's good, It's really, really bad, on purpose of course.

- The soundtracks, most of them are good!

- Models, most of the models are well made and make the game postal styled.
Though, While the jiggle physics work fine on ""The Dude's"" jacket, The female chest jiggles act like strange springs.

- The level design is easy to understand and makes sense due to the linear gameplay.

- The different story path ways, It will also tell you on the level selection at what type of branch you went on.

- Weapons, while most of them I didn't bother to use in combat, They are fun.


The bad:
- Crash issues, expect a few crashes, I didn't have that many.
Don't bother using grenades, or save before using any, because on some levels they crash the game.
There's also some others i heard about, like alt tab crash, I didn't experience that,
But it's probably because i used these start options: -window -noborder

- The AI is dumb, like, really dumb, Also when you have someone follow you, you have to clear ALL enemies for them to follow you.
Save often, because sometimes they are necessary to reach a checkpoint but can get stuck (perhaps i missed an enemy then)

- Doors, I noticed alot of times doors would be stuck closed, so you can't progress, so you should keep different saves at all time after progressing a bit.

- Rocket launcher.. Primary fire explodes the rocket in your face, But secondary fire launches the rocket like it should, Is this intended??

- Clarity, Sometime's it can be unclear of what to do, or how to approach stuff, On one level i was struggling to find a ""salad"" place to deliver toys..
I noticed later the toys actually sit on your segway in a basket, so you have to actually use the segway and drive to the mall with it..

Empezamos abriendo el juego, un ordenador de gama media os tardara entre 40 y 60 segundos en mostrar la cinematica inicial para poder empezar.
Le das a nueva partida y te tienes que comer un tutorial donde te enseñan a andar y lanzar granadas (que necesitas dos de ellas para matar a UN PUÑETERO ZOMBIE)
Vale, el sufrimiento se ha acabado, piensas, la primera mision es ir con un aspirador recogiendo pañuelos en una especia de sex shop con striptease incluido hasta que entran las tipicas madres que se quejan de todo e intentan destrozar la tienda y tu mision es encargarte. Bien, por fin empieza a ser un juego de postal. 
Aqui es cuando tu corazoncito se rompe. Se supone que tienes que usar el aspirador para disparar los pañuelos a las madres para que vomiten y se vayan, digo se supone porque APUNTAR ES IMPOSIBLE: hay una mira en el centro que solo funciona a media distancia a un rango muy concreto, si estas mas lejos los disparos se desvian y si estas mas cerca los proyectiles tienen voluntad propia y nunca aciertan. 
Bueno, pues los muelo a palos ¡¡¡¡ERROR!!!! cada vez que das un golpe el npc se cae al suelo donde si no tienes armas son invulnerables y tienes que esperar a que se levanten y repetir HASTA 15 veces que es lo que cuesta matar un maldito NPC, hasta los niños del skyrim aguantan menos
Al completar la primera mision es donde dije basta la segunda mision es de coger gatos hasta que te atacan los chinos, es en estos gags cuando recuerdas que es un juego de postal, pero no pude seguir.
NI USANDO CHEATS se aguanta esta basura. si no quieres pasarte el juego e ir directamente al sandbox, hay que tocar un archivo config y ni eso lo salva.

Je n'ai jamais voulu acheter ce jeu à cause des ""on dit"", et à l'occasion des soldes je me suis dit why not ? Et au final ce jeu n'est pas si mauvais qu'il en a l'air ou qu'on le dit.
Ce n'est pas le 2. Ne le comparez pas au 2 c'est inutile il n'a rien de son gameplay.
En revanche c'est sa suite directe, et quiconque écoute un minimum l'histoire racontée le comprend.
On peut dire que c'est inspiré de Postal premier du nom, mais en 3D. Il est similaire au premier par rapport au fait que l'histoire est divisée en niveaux et légèrement par rapport à quelques mécaniques de son gameplay.
En parlant de gameplay, sur cet opus ce qui est dommage c'est que par moments on nous donne l'impression d'avoir le choix alors que non, pas du tout. C'est qu'un détail mais voilà c'est bon de le savoir.
Vis à vis de l'humour, là c'est un peu compliqué parce qu'il y a bien des scènes drôles, mais ce n'est pas toujours l'humour que l'on connait du postal dude.
Les musiques sont assez bonnes et ne font pas trop mal au crâne.

I never wanted to buy this game because of what people say, and during the sales, I thought, why not? And in the end, this game isn't as bad as it looks or as people say.
It's not the second game. Don't compare it to the second; it's pointless; it has none of its gameplay.
On the other hand, it's its direct sequel, and anyone who listens to the story at least a little understands that.
You could say it's inspired by the first Postal, but in 3D. It's similar to the first in that the story is divided into levels and slightly in some of its gameplay mechanics.
Speaking of gameplay, what's unfortunate about this game is that at times we're given the impression we have a choice, when in fact we don't. It's just a small detail, but it's good to know.
As for the humor, it's a bit complicated because there are some funny scenes, but it's not always the humor we're used to from the Postal Dude.
The music is pretty good and doesn't make your head hurt too much.
The maps are semi-open and quite large for a game of this genre.

—The developers added multiple endings, pathways, and even a moral compass because THAT'S what we need in a Postal game; the more evil you do, the more evil you become. But that's not all, there's one level where if you let any terrorists across the border your meter starts filling up the evil path, so good luck there.
—There are also too many guns and they are not as fun to use as they should be despite the customization for all of them.
—Arresting people in the middle of combat is awkward.
—Sometimes when you want to join a side it's very difficult at first to tell who to shoot if you want to be a good or bad; an indicator would have been nice.
—Allies can get stuck in doors or hallways that prevent your character from advancing in the game which is bad. There are some vehicles that you can ride, but you need them to protect VIP's in escort missions.
—Trying to pour gasoline on someone and then set them on fire leads to teeth-grinding frustration

Enemies/Allies—Mediocre
—Allies tend to rush into battle and not use cover
—Enemies say the same dialog over and over again and they overlap their voices. May want to turn the sound down.
—Enemies that are mandatory to kill move all around the place, and the monkey experiments and ones that throw beehives at you? Trying to shoot them is like playing spin the bottle on top of a rotating rotary fan inside of a spinning circus top.

Story—Snooze fest
What story? Postal dude solves stuff with his own logic, helps some people, and either becomes bad or good. That's it. He just had to press that button...

Bosses—Monotonous
—Three boss battles in one? Thankfully it's the easiest, but good lord they are bullet sponges worse than The Division.
—Charging bosses? Forget this. Wander around and let them chase you until they happen to fall over randomly while they pretend to hit a wall. Works 1/4 of the time.
—The TANK BOSS? Don't get me started. Worst boss ever. Side-stepping around the corner to fire felt like doing the cha-cha slide to ""What Is Love?"" on thin ice. Have fun shooting the ROCKET LAUNCHER!

Graphics—Underused
—The Source engine is utilized to the lowest common denominator; the lip movements are worse than Half-Life 2, and why make the screen so small in the main menu? To show off Postal Dude's ego?

Music—Replace it
—Boring, repetitive, yawn, dull. Might as well put the music from Postal 2 on as a replacement. eve the music cannot save this game.

Conclusion
This may be the worst Postal game ever created by an outsourced developer on the Source engine. Suspending your disbelief is paramount within the first 30 minutes or so; the absurdity of events that happen one after another during the tutorial sections are rather less fun than enjoyable. Running With Scissors should have nothing to do with this, and same goes for anyone who is looking to buy this game. Stay away from it. go buy Postal and/or Postal 4 to support RWS.

-เกมนี้ถ้า load save จะทำให้เกมเด้งออกในบางครั้ง ต้องโหลดเซฟจาก auto save จึงจะเเก้ได้
-เกมนี้เวลาใช้อาวุธระยะประชิดโจมตีเเทบจะตีไม่ค่อยโดน
-ai ในเกมค่อนข้างโง่มาก อย่างเช่น ภารกิจให้พกเขาไปตรงสถานที่นั่น เเค่พวกเขาเดินชนกำเเพงนิดเดียว มันก็จะไม่เดินต่อ ต้องไปต้อนให้มา รวมไปถึงเดินเหยียบรูปภาพหรือเก้าอี้ก็จะไม่เดินอีก
-ด่านที่จะต้องสู้กับเเรดก็ต้องระวังอย่าให้ชนเพราะ ถ้าชนบางทีเราจะจมลงดินออกนอกเเมพในเกม เเล้วเราก็ต้องเริ่มเล่นด่านนั้นใหม่
-ศัครูในเกมชอบเดินไปเดินมาเวลาอยู่ใกล้เรา เเทนที่จะยิง บางทีฝั่งตาลีบันสู้กับโจรพวกโจรทำเป็นยืนนิ่งให้ยิ่งเเบบนั้นทั้งที่โจรก็มีอาวุธในมือ
-เกมนี้เล่นเป็นคนดีจะยากตรงเวลาสู้กันบางด่านประชาชนทั่วไปชอบวิ่งเข้าหาลูกปืน ทำให้เล่นยากตรงส่วนนี้
-บางด่านศัตรูจะดรอปมาเยอะเเบบไม่หยุดสู้เเถบไม่ไหว
-เกมนี้พิงกำเเพงหลบได้เเต่หลบไม่ได้หมด เพราะบางทีศัตรูก็ยิงโดนได้
-ถ้าถือ rocket launcher เเล้วคลิกเมาส์ซ้ายครั้งเดียวมันจะระเบิดใส่ตัวเรา ต้องชาร์จเเล้วยิงหรือคลิกขวาก็ได้
ส่วนข้อดีก็เเค่
-วิ่งได้
-ภาคนี้เป็นระบบ health regeneration
เเต่ถ้าโดยรวมไม่เเนะนำให้ซื้อเพราะสาเหตุข้อเสียตามที่บอกเเหละ ถ้าจะซื้อเล่น ภาค 2 ดีกว่าหรือซื้อเกมอื่นๆดีกว่านี้ ลดราคา 50 กว่าบาทสำหรับผมคิดว่าไม่คุ้มเอาเสียเลย เล่นยากกว่าภาค 2 อีก ขนาด running with scissors ยังไม่ชอบเเละเกลียดมาก","This is an unfinished Postal game. I have to say that this game is absolutely terrible. Having been a fan of Postal since the first and second games, I don't think this game can compete with the second. Plus, this game has numerous bugs and glitches, including frequent crashes. Of all the games I've played, I've crashed three times. I'll go over some of the problems and pitfalls in this game:
- Loading a save file will sometimes crash the game. You'll have to load the save file from the auto-save feature to fix it.
- Melee weapons are rarely effective.
- The AI ​​in this game is quite stupid. For example, in a mission where you have to carry someone to a certain location, if they bump into a wall, they won't move. You have to herd them to come. They'll also stop moving if they step on a picture or chair.
- Be careful not to bump into rhinos in the levels. If you do, you'll sink into the ground and leave the game map, forcing you to start the level over.
Enemies in the game tend to walk around when they're near you instead of shooting. Sometimes, when the Taliban are fighting bandits, they just stand there and shoot, even though they're armed.

The difficulty with playing as a good person is that during certain levels, civilians tend to run into the bullets, making this part difficult.

Some levels, enemies drop so many that they can't stop fighting.

You can lean against walls to avoid them, but you can't completely avoid them, as sometimes enemies can shoot you.

Holding a rocket launcher and left-clicking the mouse once will cause it to explode on you. You have to charge it up and shoot, or right-click.

The only positives are:

You can run.

This game has a health regeneration system.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend buying it for the reasons I mentioned. If you're going to buy it, you'd be better off buying the second game or another game. It's 50 baht off, and I don't think it's worth it at all. It's even harder than the second game. I even hated ""Running with Scissors."""

Эта игра лебединая песня издателя Акелла и всего что они делали в середине и под конец нулевых в игровой индустрии. Планомерная накачка плохими   играми населения, путём издания и разработки разнообразного треша закончилась её кончиной. Такой подход из 90тых не прокатил в эпоху развития интернета. Когда люди переставали доверять продажным игрожурам а обратили своё внимание на интернет обзоры обычных пользователей.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Иногда можно увидеть ностальгические комментарии игроков о разномастных старых издателях, которые обанкротились по тем или иным причинам. Старые TNQ, Sierra, Midway Games и многие другие кого игроки вспоминают за хорошие игры. Про окочурившуюся Акеллу вспомнили только в контексте мини скандала с разработкой новой части Корсаров.
Сейчас даже трудно поверить, что в нулевые игроки вполне осознано покупали игры Российских разработчиков. Трудно поверить, что в России была игровая индустрия, которая делала как полный трешь, так и игры превосходящие зарубежные. Сейчас легко можно увидеть новости по типу Российский разработчик игр «вставьте название разработчика» в скором времени выпустит свою игру «вставьте название игры». Из данных событий уже делают новости, дескать и у нас могут делать игры, а пользователи реагируют на это фразами «нужно купить и поддержать отечественного разработчика». 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ещё живые крупные российские компании занимаются в основном разработкой разнообразных онлайн игр. Поездить на танке, пострелять в террористов за [i]СПЕЦНАЗ[/i] и купить донатные вещи. Что ещё нужно современному русскому игроку? Конечно, не одна Акелла виновата в этом. Российская игровая индустрия была огромным лотком для многих издателей. Postal 3 и сама история издателя это можно сказать наглядный пример того как Российская игровая индустрия пришла к тому что она представляет из себя сейчас.","[h1][b]""[i]Akela missed![/i]""[/b][/h1]
This game is the swan song of the publisher Akella and everything they did in the gaming industry in the mid- and late 2000s. The systematic pumping of bad games onto the population by publishing and developing a variety of trash ended in its demise. This approach from the 90s didn't work in the internet era, when people stopped trusting corrupt game journalists and turned their attention to online reviews from ordinary users.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sometimes you can see nostalgic comments from players about various old publishers that went bankrupt for one reason or another. The old TNQ, Sierra, Midway Games, and many others are remembered by players for their good games. The defunct Akella was only remembered in the context of the mini-scandal surrounding the development of the new Corsairs game. It's hard to believe now that in the 2000s, players consciously bought games from Russian developers. It's hard to believe that Russia had a gaming industry that produced both complete trash and games superior to foreign ones. Now it's easy to see news stories like ""Russian game developer [insert developer name] will soon release their game [insert game name]."" These events are already making headlines, claiming that we can make games too, and users react with phrases like ""we need to buy and support a domestic developer."" 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The major Russian companies that are still active are primarily developing a variety of online games. Riding a tank, shooting terrorists as [i]SPETSNAZ[/i], and buying free items. What else does a modern Russian gamer need? Of course, Akella isn't alone in this. The Russian gaming industry was a huge market for many publishers. Postal 3 and the publisher's story itself are a clear example of how the Russian gaming industry has come to what it is today."

▼ACTUALIZACION DE RESEÑA:

►Introduccion:El juego es entretenido. Cumple completamente con su función. Lo que no cumple es con la calidad pero el juego es pasable. De todo lo que he jugado, he sufrido 3 crashes y luego funciono de maravilla.
►Historia: No es para darle mucha importancia, ya que podes pasar de estado Pasivo a Agresivo y viceversa.
►Jugabilidad: Al principio es torpe pero luego te terminas acostumbrando. Nada grave.
Como anteriormente lo habia mencionado, el motor que utiliza de Valve es una cagada, ya que al acumular muchos ragdolls esto causa un drop de frames pero no es tan grave.
►General: No hay una gran cantidad de armas como lo habia en la entrega anterior. La musica no ambienta. Yo recomiendo bajarla y poner tu propia musica de fondo en un volumen intermedio. 

CONCLUSION: ¿Porque pudo haber fallado? Lo que fallo es que RWS no fue el desarrollador principal. No eligieron un buen motor. Los desarrolladores principales no usaron correctamente los audios (no estan balanceados). La historia no era tan atrapante, basicamente cumplias ordenes y nada mas. No habia una gran cantidad de armas. En resumen, lo que intentaron hacer es dejarle a otros desarrolladores que se renueven como lo hicieron con POSTAL 1 a 2. Cambiaron la jugabilidad, la historia, el motor grafico, todo. Y eso es lo que a la gente le molesto, que no hayan conservado lo que fue POSTAL 2.

POSTAL III, el juego que recibio tanto HATE. ¿Porque fracasó? ¿Será por intentar renovarse? ¿Por utilizar el pesimo motor de Valve (Al tener una gran cantidad de NPC el juego tiene altos FPS drops) ? ¿Porque no entienden la historia del juego? ¿O porque sus objetivos no son precisos? No lo sé. Yo compre el POSTAL 4: No Regerts sin siquiera haber jugado a este. Yo sabia que le iba a darle la oportunidad a RWS y que iba a comprarme a este juego para demostrar mi apoyo. Me gustaría que las reseñas pasen a variadas. Hayan o no reembolsado el juego. Me voy a pasar este juego y les aseguro que pronto les traere una actualizacion de esta reseña.",

Когда-то купил Postal 3, немного поиграл и забросил.
Сейчас же играю, смотрю титры, слушаю озвучку, выжимаю из игры все соки и понимаю что это самая лучшая часть постала. К свед. прошёл все возможные пути, но эта игра максимум может затянуть дня на два безперерывного геймерства (48 часов)

Смотрел Postal 4 и понимаю, что 4-ая часть вообще не такая как 3-я. Совсем не интересная. досадно что всё так координально поменялось.","I first played Postal 3 at a computer club some year ago... Back then, I basically didn't understand what was going on; I was a kid.
I bought Postal 3 a while back, played it for a bit, and then abandoned it.
Now I'm playing, watching the credits, listening to the voice acting, squeezing every last drop out of the game, and I realize it's the best Postal game ever. For the record, I've played every possible way, but this game can only drag on for two days of nonstop gaming (48 hours).

I watched Postal 4 and I realize that the fourth part is completely different from the third. It's not interesting at all. It's a shame that everything has changed so dramatically."

So many cut scenes to load next mission instead of letting us free roam around to learn the map. there's not many building you can actually access, no collectables or any reason to explore when you actually can. 

Two achievements are completely bugged and not even possible to get and that's messing with my OCD. Melee weapons are completely trash and the m16 is really the only decent gun that can hit a target. Game crashes occasionally , so you best save your progress every so often. Should you buy this game? my answer only if you are a die hard fan of the postal franchise and its on sale.

Jumping into the game, I was prepared for a broken, unplayable mess. 3hrs later the credits rolled and I had a blast!

Throughout my whole gameplay experience, I never came across anything that made me think that the game was ""bad"", especially not to the extent people were describing it. The gameplay was fun, the controls were responsive, visually it has aged quite well and I genuinely thought it was quite funny. 

I enjoyed the linear style mission structure as well, blending both gameplay styles from Postal 1 and 2 into one. Because of this, the game never let up, with constant progression and action sequences that you would usually have to search for in Postal 2.

Honestly, If you are a fan of the type of comedy you see in the Postal series and you aren't too strict on games being ""perfect"", i think you'll have a really good time. Granted I went down the Evil route, so I can't advise you if the Good path is any fun, because I enjoyed just mowing everyone down.

Overall, I think I actually enjoyed this more than both of Postal 2's expansions if that says anything; Definitely give this one a go if you can get it cheap!","After finishing both Postal Redux and Postal 2, I was excited to jump into the third title, however I was very aware of the reception it received.

Wanton destruction and blatent murder of innocent and guilty bystanders.

The ability to SaveGame at nearly any moment in Time.

Cons:

Crashes at complete random.
Inability to attack anything without the entire World coming down on you like a tracking missile.
Some of the flakiest Controller support that is actually in a game, but should never be used.

首先：游戏从FPS变成了TPS，非常让人不习惯。
其次：近战打击感非常差，拳头像往别人脸上喷白雾（更别说死活揍不死人），就砍刀和铁铲还可以，警棍和狼牙棒打在人身上像打在钢板上，甚至有些近战武器根本就没打击判定，就是锤子和斧子这两个逼，如果你只有锤子和消防斧，恭喜你，那你就永远杀不了人了（TM我用这两逼玩意一个大风车过去路人都没死）
而且3代地图看着很大，但是自由度跟屎一样，2代的房子是随便进的，3代就几个房子能进（还TM是剧情需要），完全没有自由度。
DUDE奔跑起来的那个镜头摇晃我半分钟就感觉头晕了。（凯恩与林奇2表示很赞）
还有谁能告诉我猴子怎么用？激光笔都快捅人眼睛上了都不动。
DUDE踢人的姿势像个走大步的大爷，而且踢在这代几乎没用，连手雷都踢不回去，2代连火箭弹都能给你踢回去。
射击手感比BB弹还假，机枪扫起来压都压不住（5.56的M249硬是打出了M2老干妈的感觉),M16的枪声比防空炮还大声。
还有一个：反社会性，我知道夺命邮差就是以反社会性出名的，但是你一上来就让我打联合国的人是几个意思？（教程关守桥的士兵的衣服上有联合国的标志。）
而且2代是03年的，3代是11年的（尼玛你比人家晚了八年出来都作的那么烂）
还有，制作组你TM作个加血道具会死是吗，每次老子跟人火拼的时候都要躲掩体来自动回血（而且回的还死妈慢），连DUDE语音都有需要加血道具的语音了，你做个医疗包会死啊？
总而言之，3代就是一坨夹杂着伏特加呕吐物的稀屎。
如果你是为了收藏这款游戏，可以。
但如果你是为了玩的话，千万别买。

2024年2月新增：
起猛了，它居然更新了，而且是实质性的更新。","The Postman 2 is a classic, and The Postman 3 is the worst. Here are my thoughts.
First, the game went from being an FPS to a TPS, which is incredibly jarring.
Second, the melee combat feels terrible. My fists feel like spraying white mist into someone's face (not to mention they never kill them). Machetes and shovels are okay, but batons and maces feel like hitting steel. Some melee weapons don't even have hit registration, like hammers and axes. If your only weapons are a hammer and a fire axe, congratulations! You'll never kill anyone (I used those two to send a windmill through a passerby without killing anyone).
Also, The Postman 3's maps look huge, but the level of freedom is awful. In The Postman 2, you could enter any house, but in The Postman 3, you can only enter a few (and that's for plot reasons). There's absolutely no freedom.
The camera shake when Dude starts running made me dizzy after half a minute. (Kane & Lynch 2 is awesome!)
Can anyone tell me how to use the monkey? The laser pointer is almost sticking in my eyes, but it won't move. DUDE's kicking style is like a strutting old man, and it's practically useless in this game. Even grenades can't be kicked back, while in 2, even rockets can be kicked back.

The shooting feels more fake than BBs, and even machine gun fire can't suppress it (the 5.56 M249 somehow manages to sound like the M2 Lao Gan Ma). The M16's gunfire is louder than anti-aircraft guns.

Another one: antisocial. I know the Postman is known for his antisocial nature, but what's the point of having me fight UN troops right off the bat? (The soldier guarding the bridge in the tutorial has the UN logo on his shirt.)

And 2 was released in 2003, and 3 was released in 2011 (damn, you came out eight years later and still make such a mess).

Also, development team, would you be killed if you made a health-replenishing item? Every time I'm in a firefight, I have to hide in cover to automatically regenerate my health (and it regenerates so damn slowly). Even DUDE has voiceovers asking for health-replenishing items, so would you be killed if you made a medkit? In short, Postal 3 is a pile of vodka vomit mixed in with the game's turds.
If you're buying this game for your collection, fine.
But if you're just playing it, absolutely don't buy it.

Так вот, фиг там, игра будет вылетать после самого первого выбора ""плохого"" пути, причем это будет постоянно, странная закономерность. Скорей всего некоторые миссии настолько криво работают, что, она сразу вылетать начинает. Я понимаю Postal это типа треш, все дела, но это даже не треш, это говно. Из плюсов могу выделить 2 вещи, русская озвучка Чувака и в некоторых местах саунтрек.","100 crashes out of 10. This game isn't worth the money, nor is it worth the free version. Even the pirated version is more playable and more playable than the Steam version. The game is nonlinear: you can choose the good path, or the evil one. Well, screw it, the game will crash after the very first ""bad"" path, and it'll do so constantly, a strange pattern. Most likely, some missions are so broken that it starts crashing right away. I understand Postal is trash, but it's not even trash, it's crap. Two positives I can point out are the Dude's Russian voiceover and the soundtrack in some places."

This game not only has none of what makes Postal the cult followed series what it is, it's tied with Hunt Down the Freeman as the worst, most ill-prepared for commercial release game to ever use Valve's Source Engine. Running With Scissors was barely involved with its development, and stopped sell hard copies on their site less than a year after its release because of issues they had with the publisher, Akella, who was trying to leverage the game's source code against the series' rights in a last ditch attempt to avoid bankruptcy.

If none of that is enough to turn you away, and you think that purchasing this game will at least help give RWS a few bucks in royalties, think again. They got screwed out of any and all royalties of this game thanks to Akella's BS contractual agreement and could only get kickbacks from direct sales on their site (which again they stopped doing long ago). Since they aren't credited as one of the developers of this game, they legally cannot make any patches or updates that get delivered through Steam, and since they aren't the publisher they cannot take this page down. If you spend any cash on this, you are giving money to whatever anonymous Russian investor that owns the hollowed out husk that was once Akella.

RWS' own Vince Desi has since called this game, ""Akella's Non-Canon Postal Spinoff"", and he and the rest of the studio have completely disowned this game. Again, Running With Scissors doesn't see a cent of this game's purchase, and would take down this page if they could; besides that, this game has none of the charm or fun of the other Postal games. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR ANY REASON.

EDIT 10/14/23: So since this review originally came out, Akella removed the game due to issues with the DRM Postal III originally shipped with not working on modern Windows. Not long after, Jordan Freeman Group got a license to sell the game DRM free on Zoom-Platform. In September 2023, the Zoom version received an update to fix up most of the major bugs and issues with the game, especially those that caused consistent crashing, alongside adding the illusive preorder DLC weapon, the fart gun.

I gave this update a quick spin with the first few missions, and while the experience is more playable and stable, it is still not great to play. The aiming is still borked as it still relies on aiming where the weapon is pointing and not the center reticle, combat is still unintuitive, weapons still feel unsatisfying to use, the audio mixing is still subpar; all in all it's a polished turd gameplay-wise. I haven't tried the fart gun, but I cannot imagine it salvaging the experience since the base experience of the game is still bad.

I give all the credit in the world to the folks at Jordan Freeman Group and Zoom-Platform for at least fixing the technical issues, giving all players access to the preorder bonus weapon, updating the Steam version and removing the three achievements that could not be gained legitimately. However, the underlying game is still garbage, and as afaik RWS still doesn't see a cent from any sales of this game through Steam or Zoom. The only solace is that the game's price has permanently dropped to $6 USD as of the time of this revised review, but you can still find cheap games on Steam for that price, MSRP or on sale, that would give you far better experiences than Postal III.

About the only reason you'd want to pick this game up at this point is because it's on sale for dirt cheap and you plan on playing the game modded.

This is called an incomplete game riddled with bugs but frankly I don't understand why. Let's be honest, this is the worst game in the Postal series but that doesn't mean it's garbage. I went through the entire thing and the only issues I had were some crashes on loading, 3 times when an arrested NPC's body blocked a doorway and of course the bugged and in some cases literally uncompletable achievements. I had no lag whatsoever and performance was fine. The achievements are pretty f'ing messed up though. One for killing 235 terrorists will only increase, 1 kill at a time, when a meth crazed rhino boss is defeated. I mean how the hell does that even happen?

The humor and absurdity in this game is the same as the others in the series and it's the same old Postal Dude making the same old types of comments while mowing people down. Everything feels the same, there's just less of it. The game is short, the missions aren't super in depth and there's just not as much going on as in Postal 2. It's also much more linear.

The only issue for me is that RWS doesn't get any money when you buy Postal 3.

Principalmente, la novedad de la 3a persona, los gráficos, y el apartado artístico, junto a sus cinemáticas que personalmente a pesar de ser cutres, me gustan. Como negativo tenemos la repetitividad de estilo de misiones, cosa que sucede en muchos juegos pero aquí llega a quemar. El control en sí es horrible, y la optimización del juego aún más. Tampoco tiene subtítulos en español por tanto o entiendes lo que dicen o hasta luegui pillar todo el humor del juego, aún así es entendible pero ha habido cosas que me he perdido(sorry no tengo un C2 jaja). En conclusión para un público general este juego es bastante deficiente, pero para fans que pasen por alto todos los fallos que tiene, y quieran continuar la historia de Postal Dude aunque sea de una manera menos gratificante que la segunda entrega, es recomendable comprarlo de rebaja. Puntuación: 6","Recommended only if you really liked the second game. It's clearly a bad game, despite having positive aspects. Mainly, the novelty of the third-person perspective, the graphics, and the artistic section, along with its cinematics, which I personally like, despite being tacky. On the negative side, we have the repetitive mission style, something that happens in many games but here it really burns. The controls themselves are horrible, and the game optimization even more so. It also doesn't have Spanish subtitles, so you either understand what they're saying or even get all the humor of the game. It's still understandable, but there were some things I missed (sorry, I don't own a C2, haha). In conclusion, for a general audience, this game is quite deficient, but for fans who overlook all the flaws and want to continue Postal Dude's story, even if it's in a less rewarding way than the second installment, it's recommended to buy it on sale.

Я не отрицаю что это плохая игра. Мало того в некоторых аспектах она хуже чем просто плохая, она пи*децки ужасная...просто неимоверно кривая, сломанная в самых даже невообразимых местах, с уймой косяков и тому подобного.
НО! Давайте предположим...так, ты! Положи вилы и факел, и дай мне ещё пару минут!...Так о чем это я.
Ах да. Давайте здраво оценим ситуацию? 2003 год, выходит Postal 2. Собирает кучу фанатов писающих от игры кипятком(пересказ по тому что помню), и нападки на студию разработчика с требованием ""Нужно ещё!""
И просят они это, у людей которые до этого сделали игру которая выезжает только на жестокости и чернухе(прямо как Хейтред, только более яркая) я про постал 1. А учитывая что студия не шибко крутая, они отдают сторонним людям права. И вот теперь сами прикиньте и сложите 2+2.
Игра которая выезжает на чернухе и жести, которая является продолжением игры которая выезжает на чернухе и жести, имеющая уйму проблем технического характера. Во многих аспектах кривая. И вот эту серию отдают левым людям, которые должны склепать что-то на коленке с минимумом бюджета(по их заверениям). А теперь сделаем глубокий вдох и выдох. И зададим себе вопрос - ""Что бл*ть могло пойти так?""
И вроде есть все что было раньше. Чернушный и сортирный юмор с перегибом(правда иногда более специфичный), жесть и расчлененка. Уйма проблем с технической частью. Только вот в этот раз людям не понравилось. 
И я хочу у тех людей, кто требовал продолжения Postal 2 и обсирает Postal 3 спросить - ""А чего, больной уе*ок, ты ожидал от этой игры? Неужели ты хотел игру ААА класса, с рпг элементами, открытым миром, и бла-бла-бла от левой студии за мизерный бюджет? Ты что совсем с кукухой поссорился?""
*БДЫЩ* 
-Так, ладно. Не целься в меня из этой штуки! Нет, ну действительно. Ты ожидал чего-то более или менее хорошего?
Но ладно. Давай упустим техническую часть. И сосредоточимся на том, ради чего я все-таки рискну посоветовать игру.
Чернуха и сортирщина. Тут все так-же есть высмеивания стереотипов. Например что азиаты пытаются сожрать любое животное, и говорят со специфическим акцентом.(На том-же уровне высмеивались мусульмане в Postal 2) Высмеивание задротов и ЯЖМАТЕРЬей. Причем я лично проржался с некоторых ситуаций, ибо очень сильно это напоминает наши реалии(куча страшных баб, которые пытаются искоренить порно и избить красивых женщин, потому что у их мужей на них не стоит. Ничего не напоминает?)
Да некоторые шутки ну очень на любителя, или слишком перегибают. Но блин, и во 2 части тоже часто были перегибы.
Хотя все-же жаль что нет того полу открытого городка как во 2 части. Ведь ему на смену пришли коридорные локации, и очень мелкие пяточки в 2-4 улицы, на задание.
Да, ещё раз скажу, у игры уйма недостатков. Хреновое прицеливание. Убогий дизайн уровней. Некоторые шутки могут не зайти. Кривые анимации.
Но эта игра из разряда тех что: - настолько плохо, что ты блин должен это попробовать! Ибо такое нужно ощутить самому. 


Ну что? Я тебя убедил не бить меня этим прекрасным топором по голо...","Before you call me a mentally retarded drug addict, throw Molotov cocktails at me while screaming ""monster,"" and sharpen aspen stakes and machetes, first read what I wrote and don't judge me by just a thumbs-up.
I'm not denying that this is a bad game. In fact, in some respects, it's worse than just bad; it's fucking awful... just incredibly broken, broken in the most unimaginable places, with a ton of bugs and such.
BUT! Let's say... so, you! Put down the pitchfork and torch, and give me a couple more minutes!... So what was I talking about?
Oh yeah. Let's take a realistic look at the situation. 2003, Postal 2 comes out. It gathers a bunch of fans who are pissing themselves over the game (I'm retelling it from what I remember), and they attack the developer studio with the demand, ""We need more!"" And they're asking this of people who previously made a game that thrives solely on violence and gore (just like Hatred, only more graphic). I'm talking about the first one. And considering the studio isn't exactly a big name, they're handing over the rights to third parties. So now, just imagine and put two and two together.
A game that thrives on gore and gore, which is a sequel to a game that thrives on gore and gore, and which has a ton of technical problems. It's flawed in many ways. And now they're handing this series over to random people who have to slap together something on the cheap (they claim). Now let's take a deep breath and ask ourselves, ""What the f*ck could have gone wrong?""
And it seems to have everything that came before. Gory, sleazy humor with a twist (though sometimes more specific), gore and gore. A ton of technical problems. Only this time, people didn't like it.

And I want to ask those people who demanded a sequel to Postal 2 and trashed Postal 3: ""What did you expect from this game, you sick fuck? Did you really expect a AAA game with RPG elements, an open world, and blah-blah-blah from a lousy studio on a shoestring budget? Are you completely out of your mind?""
*BANG*
-Okay, okay. Don't aim that thing at me! No, seriously. Did you expect anything halfway good?

Alright. Let's skip the technical part. And focus on the reason I'm still willing to risk recommending this game.
Darkness and filth. It's all about ridiculing stereotypes, too. For example, Asians trying to eat any animal and speaking with a specific accent. (Muslims were mocked at the same level in Postal 2.) Ridicule of nerds and I'M-A-MOTHERs. I personally laughed out loud at some of the situations, because it's so reminiscent of our reality (a bunch of ugly women trying to eradicate porn and beat up beautiful women because their husbands can't get it up. Doesn't that ring a bell?)
Yes, some of the jokes are really for an acquired taste, or they're too over the top. But damn, there were a lot of over the top moments in Part 2, too.
Although it's still a shame there's no semi-open town like Part 2. After all, it's been replaced by corridor-like locations and very small patches of 2-4 streets per mission.
Yes, I'll say it again, the game has a ton of flaws. Lousy aiming. Poor level design. Some jokes might not land. Odd animations. But this game is one of those things: - so bad you have to fucking try it! Because you have to experience it for yourself.

So? Have I convinced you not to hit me in the head with that beautiful axe..."

Игра не понравилась многим из-за того что разработчики обещали много, но реализовали мало. 
Игру посоветую тем кому нравились предыдущие части.","I've completed this game, and it's not as bad as everyone said. First, I want to express my opinion on the entire series.
I tried to play the first Postal several times, but it was so boring that I turned it off after 10 minutes.
The second part, however, is an example of how a bad game in every sense of the word can be turned into an interesting and memorable project.
Everyone called the third part crap, and I thought so until I finished it. The game is designed in the same style as the previous part. It's just as crazy, and it also has a turning point where everything goes wrong.
There's also more variety: you can work for the police or be a psychopath; the game has three endings.
Many people didn't like the game because the developers promised so much but delivered so little.
I'd recommend this game to anyone who liked the previous parts."

В целом если не зацикливаться, игра не такая ужасная как складывается впечатление по обзорам. Приличная графика, на современном железе работает плавно, да присутствует много багов (из-за них в основном негатив и выливается), к динамике игры привыкаешь, со временем она начинает даже казаться прикольной. Но игра ограничена сильно на фоне 2й части.  Чтобы заполучить некоторые достижения, приходятся тратить часы на save/load операции.  Не рекомендую игру тем у кого слабые нервы.","Did you know... You won't be able to get all the achievements due to bugs. Some simply don't unlock, even story-related ones.

Overall, if you don't dwell on it, the game isn't as terrible as the reviews suggest. The graphics are decent, it runs smoothly on modern hardware, and while there are a lot of bugs (which are the main source of negativity), you get used to the game's dynamics, and over time, it even starts to seem fun. However, the game is significantly limited compared to the second game. To get some achievements, you have to spend hours saving and loading. I don't recommend this game to anyone with weak nerves."

В игре после патча ! исправили почти все баги и пофиксили разум персонажей , физика отличная! , расчлененка трупов есть после смерти!!! Трупы вообще не исчезают! Мой вердикт ИМХО
Графика - на 8/10 прорисовка персонажей и окружения хорошая ,сорс движок чуть заметен ,а так все ОК.
Звук -7/10 хороший саундтрек в миссиях , НО! есть минус - озвучка от куража и повторы из старого постала Чувака-одни и те же фразы (((
Управление -8/10 хорошее , не знаю как вы криворукие обезьяны , но единственный минус это выбор оружия - там его Слишком много!!
Геймплей -8/10 в игре очень веселые миссии ))) все улыбают ,можно даже сравнить с саинтс ров 3. В игре бывают очень тяжелые моменты , например 2оя миссия где надо собирать кошек)) китайцы отовсюду лезут)
Вывод - Игрушка для развлечения и для расслабона , не ожидайте в ней серьезности ,собирайте яблочки ,собирайте кошечек ,убивай бомжей). в общем если вы не установили патч ,то в эту игру играть нет смысла , поставьте патч и наслаждайтесь.
Общая оценка 8\10
поиграл подольше....мнда мое мнение резко изменилось , очень однообразная игра , иди зачисти здание , иди убей всех талибан , и тд. Сюжет держится только маленькими роликами, персонажи однообразые все одинаковые ,Игра становится веселой только тогда , когда играешь за психа)). ,но все равно игра заслуживает 7\10","I played this and realized that YOU'RE ALL TROLLS HERE, ruining a perfectly good game!
The game is patched! They fixed almost all the bugs and fixed the characters' minds, the physics are excellent, and there's corpse dismemberment after death!!! Corpses don't disappear at all! My verdict IMHO.
Graphics - 8/10. The characters and environments are well-drawn, the source engine is barely noticeable, but otherwise, everything is OK.
Sound - 7/10. The soundtrack is good during missions, BUT! The only downside is the mediocre voice acting and repetitions of the same old Dude post - the same old lines (((
Controls - 8/10 good, I don't know about you clumsy monkeys, but the only downside is the weapon selection - there are too many!!
Gameplay - 8/10 The game has very fun missions))) Everyone makes you smile, you can even compare it to Saints Row 3. There are some very difficult moments in the game, for example, the 2nd mission where you have to collect cats)) The Chinese are everywhere)
Conclusion - This game is for fun and relaxation, don't expect anything serious, just collect apples, collect cats, kill homeless people. In short, if you haven't installed the patch, there's no point in playing this game. Install the patch and enjoy. Overall rating: 8/10
I played for a while... and then my opinion changed dramatically. It's a very monotonous game: go clear a building, go kill all the Taliban, etc. The plot is only held together by short cutscenes, the characters are all the same. The game only becomes fun when you play as a psychopath. But it still deserves a 7/10."

Я думал, что всё не так плохо, но я сильно ошибался. Хотя с другой стороны, фанаты второй части сами виноваты в том, что случилось продолжением. Нравится туалетный юмор, полный бред происходящего, ужасный геймплей? Ну так держите, вы за это и полюбили вторую часть, не так ли? Ну я всё равно считаю первый Постал самым лучшим. 

Геймплей перекочевал из второй части, только теперь с видом от третьего лица, всё стало даже хуже. Ужас начался с выбора движка, Source отвратительный, ужасная оптимизация и кривые скрипты. Открытый мир забрали, добавили нелинейность, которая в самом конце смывается в унитаз и не имеет никакого смысла. Отдача у каждого оружия такая, будто его держит годовалый ребёнок, да и во время самого прицеливания крутит в разные стороны. Одно неплохо - сносная расчленёнка, но на этом все плюсы заканчиваются. Искусственный интеллект просто никакой, будто его вообще здесь нет. Я сгорел на уровне в полицейском участке, когда для окончания уровня мне пришлось бежать обратно за усатым, который оказывается застрял. Кстати, игру разработала российская студия TrashMasters, название уже обо всём говорит. Просто отвратительно, просто высер собаки.

Сюжет? Чувак попадает в другой город и у него заканчивается бензин, ему нужно найти деньги на него, ибо он очень дорогой. Спойлер - за всю игру деньги он не получит. В общем, любителям второй части весь бред должен быть привычен. 

Графика тоже говёная для своего времени.

Музыка вроде сначала кажется неплохой, но потом оказывается, что она такаааааааая зацикленная. Проще без неё.

Атмосфера? Ну не знаю, это п*здец какой-то. Ещё и дебильная озвучка Кураж-Бамбей, которая по качеству звучит так, будто это пиратская версия игры. 

Running with Scissors видимо отвалила кучу денег этим разработчикам и поверила им на слово, что они сделают не игру, а конфетку. Самый крупный провал на моей памяти. Просто кусок вонючего говна. Я через боль прошёл эту игру до конца, но не советую делать это вам. Смешно, что сюжетными развилками игра надеялась на реиграбельность. Нет, такой ""шедевр"" я никогда не буду перепроходить, лучше заценю на ютубе. Соболезную издателю, для них это непоправимый удар. Однако, совсем недавно в раннем доступе вышла Postal 4: No Regerts, которая полностью игнорирует 3 часть. Быть может она исправит ошибки? Также Paradise Lost с презрением отнеслась к триквелу, обыграв всё так, будто главный герой этой части - плод воображения реального Чувака. Желаю терпения и успехов Running with Scissors, и желаю стереться третьей части отовсюду. Итого мы имеем: первая часть - лучшая, - вторая часть - норм, третья часть - без комментариев, ну и четвёртая часть - пока неизвестно.

Земля тебе немытыми х*ями - 0/10","I don't know why this game exists because it's a complete nightmare. Even Running with Scissors themselves completely abandoned this game. I thought it wasn't that bad, but I was sorely mistaken. On the other hand, fans of the second game are to blame for what happened with the sequel. Like the toilet humor, the complete nonsense, the terrible gameplay? Well, here you go, that's why you loved the second game, right? Well, I still think the first Postal was the best.

The gameplay has migrated from the second game, only now with a third-person view, everything has become even worse. The horror started with the choice of engine. Source is disgusting, the optimization is terrible, and the scripts are flawed. They took away the open world, added nonlinearity, which at the very end is flushed down the toilet and serves no purpose. The recoil of each weapon is like a one-year-old holding it, and even when aiming, it spins in all directions. The only good thing is the decent dismemberment, but that's where the positives end. The AI ​​is absolutely terrible, like it doesn't exist at all. I burned out on the police station level when, to finish the level, I had to run back for the mustachioed guy, who ended up stuck. By the way, the game was developed by the Russian studio TrashMasters; the name says it all. It's simply disgusting, pure crap.

The plot? A guy ends up in another city and runs out of gas. He needs to find money for it, because it's incredibly expensive. Spoiler alert: he won't get paid for the entire game. Basically, fans of the second game should be accustomed to all this nonsense.

The graphics are also shitty for its time.

The music seems okay at first, but then it turns out to be sooooo loopy. It would be easier without it.

The atmosphere? Well, I don't know, it's just some kind of fucked-up mess. And then there's the crappy voice acting by Kurazh-Bambey, which sounds like a pirated version of the game.

Running with Scissors apparently shelled out a ton of money to these developers and took them at their word that they'd make a gem, not a game. The biggest failure I can remember. A piece of stinking crap. I played through this game through pain, but I don't recommend you do so. It's ridiculous that the game hoped for replayability with its plot twists. No, I'll never replay such a ""masterpiece""; I'd rather check it out on YouTube. My condolences to the publisher; this is an irreparable blow for them. However, Postal 4: No Regerts recently released in early access, which completely ignores the third game. Maybe it will fix the mistakes? Paradise Lost also treated the third game with disdain, treating everything as if the main character in that game was a figment of the real Dude's imagination. I wish you patience and success in Running with Scissors, and I hope the third part disappears from everywhere. So, we have: the first part is the best, the second part is okay, the third part is without comment, and the fourth part is still unknown.

I knew it was going to be awful, but somewhere I was hoping it would be laughably bad, rather than frustratingly shit. Having removed things like the open-world gameplay and even your ability to jump, I'm 100% convinced that the developers took everything that made previous Postal games good and then flushed it down the toilet. You basically just end up fighting incessant waves of generic, overly-present enemies.

55743734,polish,2019.09.24 16:48,✅,❌,0.5,0,"Uwielbiam Postala 2. Zmusiłem się żeby skończyć część 3, żeby móc ostatecznie wyrobić sobie opinię na temat tej gry.

Na początku mnie zniechęciła:
- muzyka w samouczku to jakaś katorga, od razu wyciszyłem,
- polewanie benzyną - bardzo niewygodne i nieefektywne, rzucanie granatami to samo,
- strzelanie z odkurzacza - żeby trafić w głowę trzeba celować ponad postać WTF!?
Po tym mówię mam dość, ale jednak się nie poddałem. 
Potem było gorzej - misja z kotami, fajny pomysł z morderczymi kotami, przypadł mi do gustu, ale...ataki chinoli to już jakaś kpina! Respawnowali się BEZ KOŃCA waląc we mnie w nieskończoność. Ale mimo to dałem radę (nie, że taki trudny etap, tylko po prostu opadły mi ręce).

Dalej po przyzwyczajeniu się już do ww. elementów bawiłem się całkiem nieźle, ale kolejne minusy to:
-krótkie epizody zamiast nawet pseudo otwartego świata,
- AI przeciwników całkowicie zerowy, przechodniów z resztą również, wybiegają przed lufę, a jak się gra ścieżką ""dobra"" jest to naprawdę irytujące,
-walka bronią białą - idiotyczna, maczetą i borsukiem to jeszcze można powalczyć, ale pozostałymi kogokolwiek uderzyć, a już tym bardziej zabić- jest niemożliwe,
-optymalizacja - czasem spadki FPSów niezależne od ustawień graficznych,
-krótka, 9 godzin zajęło mi przejście obu ścieżek + trochę zabawy,
- mała liczba broni palnych, 
- walka monotonna, po prostu bezmyślna sieka,
- regeneracja zdrowia,
- brak frajdy z ognia i podpalania - strasznie niewygodne i niepraktyczne,
- chowanie za osłony - w ogólnie nieprzydatne, bo przeciwnicy biegną do Ciebie na oślep i zaraz ktoś do Ciebie podbiegnie i Ci właduje magazynek w twarz, więc bardziej się opłaca biegać i strzelać,

Takie na szybko przyszły mi do głowy.

Ale grę ogólnie oceniłem na plus, dlaczego?
Bo dobrze się przy niej bawiłem, plusy:
- grafika jest całkiem znośna, fajnie wygląda miejsce rzezi - rozbryzgi krwi, kawałki ciał etc.,
- feeling strzelania, przyjemnie rozwala się przeciwników, strzelanie z broni palnej jest całkiem satysfakcjonujące, 
- nawet zabawny humor (ww. koty zabójcy, rodeo na nosorożcu),
- nowe bronie, np. borsuk (super sprawa), pszczoły, wrzucenie kota na głowę.

Podsumowując, gra jest kiepska to fakt, ale nie jest to totalny gniot, w którego nie da się grać. Jest zupełnie inna niż poprzedni Postal, bardziej to taki spin-off, i tak traktowany może sprawić radość.","I love Postal 2. I forced myself to finish Part 3 so I could finally form an opinion on the game.

At first, I was put off by:
- the tutorial music was torture, I immediately turned it down,
- pouring gasoline on the target - very uncomfortable and ineffective, throwing grenades was the same,
- shooting with the vacuum cleaner - to hit a headshot, you have to aim above the character. WTF!?

After that, I said, I've had enough, but I didn't give up.

Then it got worse - the mission with the cats, a cool idea with the killer cats, I liked it, but... the attacks by the Chinese were a joke! They kept respawning ENDLESSLY, hitting me endlessly. But I still managed (not that it was that difficult, I just got tired of it).

After getting used to the aforementioned. I had a lot of fun with the elements, but other drawbacks include:
- short episodes instead of even a pseudo-open world,
- completely nonexistent enemy AI, including pedestrians; they run out in front of the gun, and if you're playing the ""good"" path, it's really annoying,
- melee combat is idiotic. You can still fight with the machete and badger, but hitting anyone with the other weapons, let alone killing them, is impossible,
- optimization - sometimes FPS drops regardless of the graphics settings,
- short, it took me 9 hours to complete both paths + some fun,
- small number of firearms,
- monotonous combat, just mindless slashing,
- health regeneration,
- no fun with fire and setting fires - terribly inconvenient and impractical,
- taking cover - generally useless, because enemies run blindly at you, and then someone runs up to you and puts a magazine in your face, so it's more worthwhile. Run and shoot,

These are the ones that quickly came to mind.

But overall, I gave the game a thumbs up. Why?
Because I had fun with it. The pros:

- the graphics are quite passable, the carnage scene looks nice – blood splatters, body parts, etc.,
- the shooting feel, it's fun to blow up enemies, shooting with firearms is quite satisfying,
- even some funny humor (the aforementioned killer cats, the rhino rodeo),
- new weapons, like the badger (a great idea), bees, and throwing a cat on your head.

In summary, the game is bad, that's true, but it's not a complete mess that's unplayable. It's completely different from the previous Postal, more of a spin-off, and treated as such, it can be enjoyable."

Postal III is a weird game. It's one of the worst in the series and had a extremely awful development.

Postal III was ment to be big. It was being developed for source way back in 2007 when Valve handed out the Engine and was sadly a disaster. RWS outsourced this, and that resulted from Akella, known as ""Russian EA"" taking a hit from the russian economy and had to fire their A Team and shove this over to their B-Team to finish the game, resulting in almost 100s of things cut and rushed out. RWS caught wind of this in the final months of development after hearing nothing for almost a year and was hesistant to cancel the project cause they knew it's going to be screwed up. And it released. And it was really bad, and taught themselves to never outsource again. RWS then denied all payment for sales and take this game as a meme in their series, even making it Non-canon in Paradise Lost. 
Funniest part is that Akella also wanted to make this game not rated by the ESRB, which would result in the game BEING SOLD ONLY IN RUSSIA. RWS had to quickly hand out steam keys to people who pre-ordered or bought the game and tried to avoid that.

Story :
Postal III follows after Apocolypse weekend directly after the bridge ending. Postal Dude is back, now in Catharsis, a sister-city to Paradise and has to get gas to get out of town. Sadly, Gas is rediculously expensive so Dude has to do some errands around town.
Although, that's forgotten in less then 10 minutes and it's just about dude's adventures in Catharsis and really awful jokes, trying too hard to make it funny and edgy. The plot is non-sense and is terrible, and I was literally cringing at the plot half the time, and mostly it's references to better games, like Dude making idle comments about playing GTA IV or something of the sort or really dated jokes.

The plot mainly follows Dude's morality and choices you make, which all make no sense most of the time. You got choices through the story that will change the outcome of the plot, such as in one part, you gotta protect the chief of police, you can gun through everything which will result in you not getting hired or just shoot the bad guys and get to have storyline where you work for the Police. Also, the concept is broken because if you do the good run, you get the bad outcome and won't be a cop, but bad outcome, you become a cop because of a bug. It's a interesting concept, but the morality system hurts gameplay cause it affects the main ending aswell, and will literally cuck you on the final level if you don't have high or low morality and it's not polished at all. 
But, the systems are confusing really. And you'll end up scratching your head cause you made a single mistake, and it ruined the concept of Postal 2. Postal 2, you were dude. You made your own choices cause you were in this world, you got choices but you were still able to finish or play the game, mostly just a ""What would you do"" sorta thing. 3 throws that away completely.
3/10.

Gameplay :
It's bad. 
Gunplay is weak, melee combat barley functions and game is a chore to play. The game's guns barley pack a punch.
Only powerful and working weapon is the M16. Other then that, all the other weapons are awful.
And the AI is terrible. No Police systems either, so cops just shoot you and forget about you later on. No money systems either, no shops, no inventory, and no map. The game is painfully linear and has nothing left of Postal 2's identity.

There is a sandbox mode which connects most of the city maps into load zones but it's kinda weak. Just run about and shoot people is what it is, or explore the city. Other then that, the gameplay is a slog.
2/10.

Visuals : I like the style of this game though.
They did a really good job on the art design and look of the game. It's a crap game but looks nice. 
Models look decent, and it has this mix of a comic and real life. 

Visually, the game does have some good lighting and nice looking levels. So, that's a good point.
6/10.

Verdict :
This game sucks. Go buy Postal 2 or 4. It's better. 

This game is a trainwreak. The story is bad, gameplay sucks, and the rest of the game is no better or mediocre. 

1/10

HOWEVER, a random community update dropped which removed the DRM they had which made it unplayable, and they did add Mod support and some other additions such as pre-order Fart Gun and lots of minor fixes! So, the game has full mod support and is more stable then in the past. They also changed the price from $9 to $5 and readded the game onto Steam with an Official Soundtrack for free. So, if your a source nut or into modding shit, feel free to try it. But if you want an fun game, avoid this at all cost.","3/18/24

Мне нравится как Постал 3 выглядит визуально, видно же что старались как могли (в перерывах, когда заканчивалось бухло). Музыка хорошая, шутки... иногда забавные, они не бесят по крайней мере.

I like the visuals of Postal 3; it's clear they tried their best (during breaks, when the booze ran out). The music is good, the jokes... sometimes funny, at least they're not annoying. Technically, of course, this game is a complete failure in a ton of ways, but that's partially fixed by fan patches. Skyrim fans also patched and tweaked it here and there :D Many criticize the game for being too linear compared to the second game. It doesn't really matter, Apocalypse Weekend was also linear and didn't seem to be that bad (not the best example, of course; that expansion was a piece of crap). But still, the game is entertaining!

Время писать обзорчик ""Ну сейчас я разгуляюсь""

Играть в постал 3 - это как eбaтьcя, но на пол шишечки.

Игра плохая, потому что ""Это все М-TV виновато""

Вроде бы все нормально: есть сюжет, есть юмор, есть умеренный треш (меньше чем в apocalypse weekend, но чуть больше, чем в оригинальном втором), обилие оружия, Чамп, даже графон завезли, но чёт не то.

""Во все виноват Губка Боб""

Игра скучная, половина музыки ужасна, а еще она начинает играть только тогда, когда начинается движ. И играет одна песня на уровень. По кругу. Если по каким то причинам тебе понадобится час, что бы пройти уровень, то ты час будешь слушать на повторе одну песню (про час я конечно утрировал, вся игра проходится за четыре). ""В ГТА физика лучше!"" Вид от третьего лица ужасен, тк не удобный. Куча багов вылетов, ужасная оптимизация. Говорят обещали открытый мир, но его нет. Как в apocalypse weekend задание-локация. ИИ как люди в реальной жизни и АКЕЛЛА - пиздец тупые

""Сколько кошек помещается под этот плащ!"". Но в целом то сюжет не плох и, хотя я и говорил про скуку, но иногда может и быть и увлекательно. Чего стоит только сорокалетний мальчик-раб. А еще есть три пути прохождение: хорошим, святым и психопатом. Соответственно три концовки. ""Такого не было даже когда я курил шишки"".


Кажется стоит рекомендовать игру, но тут рядом красная кнопка. ""Прикольная какая кнопка. Не кнопка, а конфетка. А что будет если нажать? Никто не смотрит, может стоит слеееегка нажать? Все, нажимаю. Нет, не стоит наверное. Все, нажал""

""Жесть. Мне даже почти стыдно. Это моя работа?"" ""Надеюсь это не занесут в мое личное дело"".

А ""вы будете гореть в аду. Аминь"".","""Video games never taught them anything.""

Time to write a review. ""Well, now I'll go wild.""

Playing Postal 3 is like fucking, but only half-baked.

The game is bad because ""It's all MTV's fault.""

It seems okay: there's a plot, there's humor, there's moderate trash (less than in Apocalypse Weekend, but a little more than in the original 2), plenty of weapons, Champ, they even brought in some graphics, but it's just not quite right.

""It's all SpongeBob's fault.""

The game is boring, half the music is terrible, and it only starts playing when the action starts. And one song plays per level. On a loop. If for some reason it takes you an hour to complete a level, you'll be listening to the same song on repeat for an hour (I'm exaggerating about the hour, of course; the entire game takes four). ""GTA has better physics!"" The third-person view is terrible because it's inconvenient. Tons of bugs and crashes, terrible optimization. They promised an open world, but it doesn't exist. It's like the Apocalypse Weekend mission/location. The AI ​​is like real-life humans, and Akella is fucking stupid.

""How many cats can fit under that cloak!"" But overall, the plot isn't bad, and although I mentioned it's boring, it can sometimes be engaging. Just look at the forty-year-old slave boy. There are also three paths to play: good, saint, and psychopath. Consequently, there are three endings. ""This never happened even when I was smoking weed.""

I think I should recommend the game, but there's a red button nearby. ""What a cool button. Not a button, but a candy. What happens if I press it? No one's looking, maybe I should press it a tad lighter? Okay, I press it. No, I probably shouldn't. Okay, I pressed it.""

""This is brutal. I'm almost ashamed. Is this my job?"" ""I hope this doesn't end up in my personal file.""

And ""you will burn in hell. Amen."""

I grew up with [b]POSTAL[/b] and [b]POSTAL 2[/b] so a while ago I was naturally excited for Postal 3, but after it got pushed back I had a feeling something is going wrong.

And holy shit I was right.

Let's start with the engine itself, the source engine might be the worst possible choice for a game like Postal in my opinion, it was never meant to be used for a 3rd person game, and it shows. Textures are ugly, sounds are straight up missing, and half of the game just feels like an early access game that a single guy made, the game crashes VERY often for really no reason what so ever, guns feel awful along with the aiming (Again, source engine is not good for 3rd person games), and the animations are absolutely terrible, sprinting will likely give you motion sickness after you do it too much.

The """"""story"""""" is pure cringe. While POSTAL 2 had the more ""subtle"" approach to things, while still being funny and offensive, here it feels like a 10 years old kid came up with half of the scenes / dialogues and missions. It just doesn't work, they even pulled the ""don't do this thing even though you are supposed to do it"" after just 10 minutes.

And of course, the bugs. Oh good lord the bugs. I barely played half an hour of this game and I found the following bugs:
[list]
[*]Subtitles are invisible if you change resolution and don't restart your game
[*]Gun sounds are sometimes completely silent
[*]Switching weapons won't always ""flip"" the gun UI in order, making it look very confusing
[*]The catnip doesn't always work with cats, and even after they're seemingly stunned, the game won't let you pick them up
[*]No sounds what so ever for picking up guns
[*]No sounds when hitting someone with fists / melee
[*]Stunning enemies with a tazer (Which is what you're supposed to do) will make your friendly NPC NOT attack them, hence you'll be stuck, since in order to progress she needs to kill them, not you.
[*]Guns don't always fire if you press the left mouse button, sometimes they fire if you LET GO of the left mouse button.
[*]You can actually fall under the map if you ragdoll in certain places after getting hit by enemies.
[*]Music will randomly cut out and restart during a mission
[*]Physic objects can, and will get in your way sometimes, and they'll rarely go in the direction you're trying to push them in.
[*]Changing volume in the options menu during gameplay crashed my game once. It didn't do it again but I'll include it here.
[/list]

If you STILL want to get this game for.. some.. reason, just get the 20th anniversary collectors edition, it'll get you all the GOOD postal games, and this one, along with some cool merch, and you'll be supporting RWS directly, not these... people.","[i]Where do I start...[/i]

Что сказать? Прошел я ее еще тогда и может даже не один раз. Что то в ней вроде и есть, но... слабо, откровенно слабо. Видно, что картинка и карты в игре проработаны довольно неплохо(Source в принципе довольно неплохой движок и красивую картинку выдать может), но остальное хромает на обе ноги. Баланс, геймплей, сюжет, шутки, оптимизация - это все  по сути основа игры и с ними все довольно плохо. К тому же некоторые вещи упразднили и это так же разочаровывает. Например в Postal 2 какой-никакой был фриплей в рамках сюжета, а тут по сути очень линейная игра с однотипными и неинтересными миссиями, где фриплей добавили в виде отдельного режима и то спустя несколько патчей и он довольно неинтересен и бесмысленннен. Если в Postal 2 можно было чисто ради фана погриндить деньги,  понапокупать курительных трубок и покормить пончиками собак и метов, а после опять вернуться к сюжетным миссиям, то здесь такого нет. Кроме всего прочего зачем то сделали регенерацию жизней, как в Gear of War, убрали прыжки, добавили укрытия. Ну и опять же игра бесмысленна. Да это трэш и да Postal 2 тем более, но там все же был какой то смысл и каждое задание было хорошо тем, что представляло из себя какую то повседневную рутину среднестатистического человека, которая оборачивалась лютым звездецом. Здесь же что не нелепость, то какая то неумелая отсылка к предыдущей игре... Короче это надо играть, но лучше не стоит. Опять же повторюсь у игры есть неплохой скелет, но вокруг него ""дерьмовое русское мясо"", которое могло бы работать, но не работает.","I bought the game back when it first launched, as a disc edition. I never saw the developers' promise of a Steam bundle, so I bought it here on sale.
What can I say? I played it back then, maybe even more than once. It has some elements, but... it's weak, frankly weak. The art and maps are clearly well-designed (Source is a pretty good engine and can produce beautiful art), but everything else is lacking. Balance, gameplay, story, jokes, optimization—these are essentially the core of the game, and they're all pretty poorly executed. Furthermore, some features have been removed, which is also disappointing. For example, Postal 2 had some freeplay as part of the story, but here it's essentially a very linear game with repetitive and uninteresting missions. Freeplay was added as a separate mode, and even then, only after several patches, and it's quite uninteresting and pointless. While in Postal 2 you could grind money for fun, buy some pipes, feed donuts to dogs and meth heads, and then return to the story missions, there's no such thing here. On top of all that, they've for some reason implemented health regeneration like in Gear of War, removed jumping, and added cover. And then again, the game is pointless. Yes, it's trash, and yes, Postal 2 is even more so, but there was some sense to it, and each mission was good because it represented some everyday routine of the average person that turned into a complete disaster. Here, if it's not absurd, it's a clumsy reference to the previous game... In short, you have to play it, but it's better not to. Again, I repeat, the game has a decent core, but it's surrounded by ""crappy Russian meat,"" which could have worked, but doesn't."

1-RWS unfairly drowned the game in crap, as the game had enough content for two (almost) full games.
2-There's more trash.
3-A very convoluted plot with two paths—good and bad (I just like that).
4-The game is made on the Source engine, so the graphics look solid.
Cons
1-Lack of any optimization, causing the game to run at 40-50 fps, or even 20.
2-Linearity
3-Third-person view (why they couldn't combine TP and FP is unclear)
Overall:
4.8 out of 10, and the game is partially saved by the fact that the voice of Courage-Bombay (Denis Kolesnikov)
is similar to the voice acting of almost every TV series from the 2000s, although it's unclear why they couldn't have invited Alexander Gruzdev."

Огромное количество багов, глюков, частенько происходят вылеты. То, что игра от 3 лица, а не от первого - не проблема.

While the second game offered several playthrough options, here, while there's a semblance of choice, it's really all about gunplay, with the exception of the no-kill mode, which requires using a taser.

I'm a big fan of both, so I found this game to be particularly enjoyable. The crude, tasteless and intentionally offensive storytelling is easily the highlight, and it all reeks of smug self-satisfaction. The game insults everyone, especially the player, and your reward for perseverance is to endure more merciless mocking and aimless social commentary. I wish more games had the balls to be so shameless.

The game carries on the themes of its predecessor, Postal 2, but it's a lot less artistic about it. Postal 2 was “only as violent as you are”, and the same can be said of Postal 3, but Postal 3 is less interested in gray morality or nuances. There are two black and white paths to choose: Good or Insane. Being insane is easier, more fun, and allows you to use the crazy variety of messed up weaponry to your enjoyment. Being good is... boring, and difficult. It's similar to Postal 2's thematic take on morality, though it lacks the depth. Being good is hard and boring, being bad is easy and fun. The message hasn't changed much.

I think the thing that sold me on Postal 3 in the end was its hidden third ending, which you receive only if you complete the entire game without killing someone. It's a monumental task and your only reward is a cutscene, but it's physically possible to play this entire game non-lethally. Again, being good is hard. Being a pacifist in a world of murderers is even harder.

The core gameplay is probably what disappointed people the most. It's comprised of largely linear objective-focused traditional videogame levels. You shoot men or collect things or guard someone, then you move onto the next level and do it again. I think the shooting feels fine, and I appreciate the wide variety in locations and the odd attempt at enemy variety. That being said, the sheer repetition of things could easily get to a lot of people.

There is one particular mission that was bugged beyond all reason, but aside from that, most of them seemed to function as intended. There were the occasional freezes, but that's what the quicksave is for, surely.","Postal 3 is an exercise in freedom of expression, and if you want- an exercise in patience.

(A line from Dude in the second game hints at this: ""I enjoy the legal right to use a gun, and yet you're so afraid?"") Anyone could become the trigger-puller, and in the end, only humanity's most powerful weapon, the nuclear bomb, can quell all violence. Aren't the protagonist Dude's circumstances and actions similar to many of the current problems in Europe and the United States? I've heard that countries are constantly opposing this game, but don't they realize that what they should be opposing is their own greed? Isn't opposing guns and violence what they should truly be resisting?"

Porém apesar de tudo isso, o jogo me divertiu bastante, me tirou risadas e o próprio jogo sabe que é ruim e ele mesmo se zoa, é legal tentar escolher o lado do bem como no postal 2 a diferença é que nesse é oficial e diferencia as missões realmente, existe uma quantidade imensa de bugs e a otimização é terrivel, sério o jogo crasha o tempo todo, parece que nem o pc quer rodar esse jogo, as missões são repetitivas e da a impressão do jogo ser muito mais longo do que realmente é, eu mesmo achei ter jogado mais de 10 horas quando foram apenas 6.
depois de ler tudo isso você pensa ""mano só um demente pra comprar esse jogo"" de fato, mas eu particularmente gosto dele e me divirto bastante jogando, sério, eu me divirto até usando o taser pra prender as pessoas no caminho do bem, então sim eu recomendo comprar esse jogo na promoção, ele pode ser terrivel mas é divertido demais pelomenos pra mim","I'll be brief, the game is extremely poorly optimized, it crashes all the time, it freezes a lot on a current PC that is running Far Cry 5 and Resident Evil 2 very well, it is buggy and has bugs that force you to reset the save, you need to save constantly to not lose your progress because if you fail, it doesn't matter if it's your mistake, a bug or a crash, you return from the beginning of the mission, as there are no checkpoints, you must always save, it doesn't have subtitles not even in English, very poorly programmed, AI dumber than anything you can imagine among other things. But despite all this, the game was a lot of fun for me. It made me laugh, and the game itself knows it's bad and makes fun of itself. It's cool to try to choose the side of good, like in Postal 2. The difference is that this one is official and really differentiates the missions. There are a huge amount of bugs and the optimization is terrible. Seriously, the game crashes all the time. It seems like not even the PC wants to run this game. The missions are repetitive and give the impression of the game being much longer than it actually is. I myself thought I had played for more than 10 hours when it was only 6. After reading all this, you think, ""Man, only a lunatic would buy this game."" Indeed, but I personally like it and have a lot of fun playing it. Seriously, I even have fun using the taser to stop people on the path of good. So, yes, I recommend buying this game on sale.

Maybe everyone forgot, but Postal 2 was also pretty glitchy, with long loading times, poor ballistics, and FPS drops. But this one isn't that difficult; the game is entertaining. There are lots of references for CIS players. The dark side playthrough even has an unexpected twist. Otherwise, I finished it in two evenings and thoroughly enjoyed it.

48832863,russian,2019.01.08 01:47,❌,✅,0.8253374696,83,"Итак, мнение об этой игре у меня весьма не однозначное и вот почему:

Плюсы:
- Postal 3 по трэшу, чёрному юмору и аморальщине не уступает предыдущей части, а где-то даже превосходит;
- в игре приятная картинка, яркая атмосфера и не плохо визуализированный персонаж;
- хорошо прописанный характер персонажей, это сложно не заметить;
- вопреки комментариям о том, что мол не канон, я не соглашусь, ибо атмосфера и геймплей игры вызывает только два вопроса - ""Какого чёрта здесь происходит?"" и ""Да чёрт возьми, какого хрена тут творится?!"" (как и в Postal 2);
- есть история (сюжет) и такая же не плохая (опять же если сравнивать с предыдущей частью);
- классная озвучка от студии ""Кураж-Бамбей"" и саундтрек.

На этом, плюсы, к сожалению заканчиваются и начинаются минусы:
- самый огромный и жирный минус, за который я вообщем-то только и поставил отрицательный отзыв, это БЕЗДЕЙСТВИЕ РАЗРАБОТЧИКОВ(ИЗДАТЕЛЕЙ). Postal 3 - сырая игра. Количество багов в ней превышает все нормы. Тут будет ""небольшой"" подпункт этих багов:
- баг звука (то звук пылесоса залипнет и перейдёт в кат-сцену, то скрипы какие-то, то музыка играет параллельно с другой музыкой... дурдом);
- баг на нпс (постоянно где-то застревают бедные нипы, особенно те, которых приходится сопровождать по заданию);
- баг на ачивки (некоторые ачивки просто-напросто не выполняются без каких-либо причин, бывает помогает перезапуск игры, но не на долго);
- баг на двери, мелкие объекты под ногами и животных (всё перечисленное имеет свойство отталкивать персонажа с необычайной силой);
- баг на оружие (бывает так случается, что оружие не стреляет или же пустой балончик из под кошачьей мяты не выбрасывается);
- для игры 2011 года, считаю игра не достаточно оптимизирована;
- ИИ ужасен, иногда нпс-враги друг друга в упор не видят и тупо стоят, также и сопровождаемые нипы;
- постоянные вылеты из игры (и нет,дело не в пк, дело однозначно в игре, ибо ни одна игра ещё у меня не вылетала, кроме этой, да и компудактер мой не слабый вовсе. Проблема в этом не у меня одного, если почитать комменты).

Можно ещё несколько нюансов упомянуть (например, невыполненные обещания разработчиков), но я думаю уже и так достаточно минусов, чтобы вынести вердикт.
Повторюсь, если бы разработчики прислушались к жалобам пользователей и во время фиксили свои ошибки, то эта игра не была бы на столько неиграбельной. Но, очевидно, на игру клали болт, как и на покупателей этой игры.
Postal 3 мне очень напоминает ситуацию с Fallout 76,  интересно почему,хмммм...

По итогу:
За все возможные плюсы игры, какие только я смог отыскать, оценю на 4/10 и то с натяжкой.
Игру покупать категорически не рекомендую, ибо разрабы этого не заслужили. Даже со скидкой.","So, my opinion of this game is quite mixed, and here's why:

Pros:
- Postal 3 is just as trashy, dark humorous, and immoral as its predecessor, and in some ways even surpasses it;
- The game has pleasant visuals, a vibrant atmosphere, and well-designed characters;
- The characters are well-written, it's hard to miss;
- Despite the comments about it not being canon, I disagree, because the game's atmosphere and gameplay raise only two questions: ""What the hell is going on here?"" and ""What the hell is going on here?!"" (just like in Postal 2);
- There's a story (plot), and it's just as good (again, compared to the previous game);
- Excellent voice acting from the studio ""Kurazh-Bambey"" and the soundtrack.

Unfortunately, that's where the positives end and the negatives begin:
- The biggest and most significant negative, the only reason I actually gave a negative review, is the INACTION OF THE DEVELOPERS (PUBLISHERS). Postal 3 is a crude game. The number of bugs in it exceeds all standards. Here's a ""small"" subsection of these bugs:
- Sound bug (the vacuum cleaner sound sometimes gets stuck and goes into a cutscene, sometimes there are creaking sounds, sometimes the music plays in parallel with other music... crazy);
- NPC bug (the poor NPCs are constantly getting stuck somewhere, especially those you have to escort on a mission);
- Achievement bug (some achievements simply don't complete for no apparent reason; restarting the game sometimes helps, but not for long);
- Bug on doors, small objects underfoot, and animals (all of these tend to push the character away with extraordinary force);
- a weapon bug (sometimes the weapon won't fire or an empty catnip can won't be dropped);
- for a 2011 game, I think the game isn't optimized enough;
- the AI ​​is terrible; sometimes enemy NPCs can't see each other at point-blank range and just stand there, the same goes for accompanied NPCs;
- constant game crashes (and no, it's not the PC, it's definitely the game, as I've never had a game crash like this before, and my computer isn't weak at all. I'm not the only one with this problem, if you read the comments).

I could mention a few more nuances (for example, the developers' unfulfilled promises), but I think there are already enough downsides to pass judgment.
Again, if the developers had listened to user complaints and fixed their bugs in a timely manner, this game wouldn't be so unplayable. But, obviously, they didn't give a damn about the game, nor about the people who bought it.
Postal 3 reminds me a lot of the Fallout 76 situation, I wonder why, hmmmm...

In the end:
For all the positives I could find, I'd give it a 4/10, and that's a stretch.
I strongly advise against buying this game, as the developers don't deserve it. Even with a discount."

[u]Pontos Positivos[/u]

+ Variedade decente de armas;
+ Ambientes decentes, assim como a variedade dos mesmos;
+ Trilha sonora decente.

[u]Pontos Negativos[/u]

- Gameplay fraca e entediante;
- Mesmo com a variedade, as armas são entediantes e você não vai usar a maioria delas.
- Crashes frequentes;
- Tempos de carregamento muito longos;
- Variedade de inimigos baixa;
- Duração curta (torno de 5 horas).

[h1]Resumo[/h1]

 [i]POSTAL 3[/i] é notório por ser odiado por fãs e pela própria [i]Running With Scissors[/i], e devo dizer que ambos estão completamente certos em odiá-lo. [i]POSTAL 3[/i] é um jogo com uma gameplay genérica, onde você inevitavelmente vai usar apenas três armas: A M16, a M60 e o taser, caso você não queira matar o inimigo em um jogo da série [i]POSTAL[/i]. As missões são chatas e na maioria das vezes consistem em coletar itens/""veículos"" ou incapacitar/matar um certo número de inimigos, sim, incapacitar. O jogo implementa um sistema de ""moralidade"" que afeta as missões e o final do jogo. Esse sistema vai totalmente contra o que os jogos anteriores definiram, diversão através da violência absurda e cômica. Por fim, o jogo é curto, o que pode ser uma bênção disfarçada. Excluindo todas as coisas que [i]POSTAL 3[/i] executa mal, o restante é apenas decente (por pouco), e não te prende por muito tempo. Mesmo que você esteja curioso para saber como esse jogo infame é, eu recomendo apenas ver um vídeo sobre ele (eu recomendo [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLdVzYLjwW0]esse vídeo[/url], em inglês) ao invés de gastar seu dinheiro, mesmo que esteja em promoção.

[u]Pros[/u]

+ Decent weapon variety;
+ Decent environments, as well as their variety;
+ Decent soundtrack.

[u]Cons[/u]

- Weak and boring gameplay;
- Even with the variety, the weapons are boring and you won't use most of them.
- Frequent crashes;
- Very long loading times;
- Low enemy variety;
- Short length (around 5 hours).

[h1]Summary[/h1]

[i]POSTAL 3[/i] is notorious for being hated by fans and [i]Running With Scissors[/i] itself, and I must say they're both completely right to hate it. [i]POSTAL 3[/i] is a game with generic gameplay, where you'll inevitably use only three weapons: the M16, the M60, and the taser, unless you want to kill the enemy in a [i]POSTAL[/i] game. The missions are boring and mostly consist of collecting items/""vehicles"" or incapacitating/killing a certain number of enemies—yes, incapacitating. The game implements a ""morality"" system that affects the missions and the game's ending. This system completely contradicts what the previous games defined: fun through absurd and comical violence. Finally, the game is short, which may be a blessing in disguise. Excluding all the things [i]POSTAL 3[/i] does poorly, the rest is only decent (barely), and doesn't keep you hooked for long. Even if you're curious about this infamous game, I recommend simply watching a video about it (I recommend [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLdVzYLjwW0]this video[/url], in English) instead of spending your money, even if it's on sale.

Абсолютно играбельный отечественный продукт с вполне вменяемой оптимизацией (с учетом того, сколько в игре трупаков, рассчлененки и кровищи, и все это, как я заметил, с уровня не пропадает).
Да, это не каноничное продолжение Postal 2 , который я безумно люблю, и который был моей чуть ли не первой ПК игрой. НО третий постал по своей атмосфере скорее напоминает трэш-фильм ""Postal"" от режиссера Уве Болла. 
Если во второй части был сюжетный стеб над неудачником, то в игре от наших разработчиков идет более пошлый и толстый юмор. Игра во всем отличается от своего предшественника. Но не сказать, что в худшую сторону. Это просто две разные игры.
Кто любит юмор более черный и трэшевый, или кому понравилось кино от Уве Болла, я советую поиграть в третий постал и никого не слушать. Игра проходится на одном дыхании за один присест.","I honestly don't understand the hate towards this game. It's a perfectly playable domestic product with decent optimization (considering the amount of corpses, dismemberment, and gore in the game, all of which, as I noticed, doesn't disappear once you reach the level).
Yes, it's not a canonical sequel to Postal 2, which I absolutely love and which was practically my first PC game. BUT the atmosphere of the third postal is more reminiscent of the trashy film ""Postal"" by director Uwe Boll.

While the second part featured a narrative mockery of the underdog, this game from our developers features a more vulgar and blunt humor. The game is completely different from its predecessor. But I wouldn't say it's for the worse. They're simply two different games.
For those who enjoy darker, trashier humor, or who liked Uwe Boll's films, I recommend playing the third postal and ignoring everyone else. The game is a breeze to complete, in one sitting."

44999212,russian,2018.08.29 15:17,❌,✅,0.5725238323,13,"Postal III — экшен шутер от первого лица с псевдо-открытым миром от студии Trashmasters, дочерней компании Акелла. В основном, эта кампания занималась издательством игр в России (например, [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/13530/Prince_of_Persia_The_Two_Thrones/]Принца Персии[/url] и [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/15100/Assassins_Creed_Directors_Cut_Edition/]Кредо Убийцы[/url]), но и выпускала свои игры ([url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/764670/Sea_Dogs/]Корсары[/url], Пираты Карибского Моря). Postal III является продолжением [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/223470/POSTAL_2/]Postal 2[/url], но из-за низкого качества, я бы сказал отвратительного, игру признали спин-оффом второй части. 
Игра получилась если не мерзкой, то нереально глупой и низкосортной. Она гадкая своим контентом, тупая сюжетом, кривая разработкой, а ее юмор на уровне, если не унитаза, то глотки, куда сливаются нечистоты. 

Сюжет игры начинается с того, что Чувак покидает Парадайз. Вот только мост из города опечатан военными. После непродолжительной беседы с военными и обучения игрока «основам» игры, Чувак поднимает мост, уничтожая оцепление военных и... и всё. Это не несет какого-то смысла, не несет ничего, но преподали это, как нечто такое, будто мы на кнопку ядерной ракеты нажали. Ужас! После такого провала, Чувак попадает в Катарсис — второй райский город после Парадайз. Протагонист решает поселиться здесь, а мы помогаем ему это сделать, найдя работу в городе.
Игровой процесс здесь построен вокруг «черного» юмора. Все подработки имеют характер ""заднего прохода"" и игра тупо выезжает, пытается, на словах и действиях, типа, ""Ах-ха, там написано ""дрoчить"" или типа того. В ней нет цензуры и это ее главный минус. Postal 2 запомнился нам жестокостью, но гибкостью игровой системы, движка; запомнился нам открытым городом Парадайз, нереальной, но управляемой тупостью. Трэшмастерс пошли по стопам своего названия и создали трэш-игру, которая взяла из Postal 2 то, за что ненормальные люди ее ругали, а многие и подавали в суд — жестокость и отсутствие цензуры (как словесного, так и телесного).

Я многое не написал и не напишу в обзоре, потому как впечатление от второй части до сих пор меня преследуют. Игра мне понравилась настолько сильно, что я не поверил никому и купил третью часть. Если вы фанат игры или просто хотите познакомится с Postal, эту игру не стоит покупать, на нее даже лучше не смотреть. Я не рекомендую данную игру к приобретению. На момент написания обзора, цена на игру составляет нереальные 399 рублей, это слишком много для нее. Я купил ее за 8о+ рублей и надеждой, что она хотя бы не будет мне отвратительна, увы, оказалось всё наоборот. 
Хочу отметить, что такая ситуация с игровой серией, мне напомнила FlatOut. Если помните (а если нет - посмотрите), то после успеха [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2990/FlatOut_2/]FlatOut 2[/url] и [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/12360/FlatOut_Ultimate_Carnage/]Ultimate Carnage[/url], серия перешла в руки Team 6 Studio,выпустившие [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/201510/Flatout_3_Chaos__Destruction/]Flatout 3: Chaos & Destruction[/url], которая собрала кучу негативных обзоров и... от себя скажу, что культовую серию FlatOut просто очернили.","Postal III is a pseudo-open-world first-person shooter from Trashmasters, a subsidiary of Akella. Akella primarily published games in Russia (e.g., Prince of Persia and Assassin's Creed), but also released its own games (Corsairs and Pirates of the Caribbean). Postal III is a sequel to [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/223470/POSTAL_2/]Postal 2[/url], but due to its low, I'd say appalling, quality, the game was relegated to a spin-off of the second game.

The game turned out to be, if not disgusting, then incredibly stupid and shoddy. Its content is vile, its plot is dumb, its development is flawed, and its humor is at the level of, if not a toilet, then a sewer.

The game's plot begins with the Dude leaving Paradise. However, the bridge out of the city is sealed by the military. After a brief conversation with the military and teaching the player the ""basics"" of the game, the Dude raises the bridge, destroying the military cordon and... that's it. It doesn't make any sense, it doesn't make any sense, but it's presented as if we've pressed the button on a nuclear missile. Horrible! After this failure, the Dude finds himself in Catharsis, the second paradise after Paradise. The protagonist decides to settle here, and we help him do so by finding a job in the city.
The gameplay here is built around dark humor. All the side jobs are of a ""backdoor"" nature, and the game just plain makes it through, trying, through words and actions, like, ""Ah-ha, it says 'masturbate'"" or something like that. It's uncensored, and that's its main drawback. Postal 2 was remembered for its brutality, but the flexibility of its gameplay system and engine; it was remembered for the open city of Paradise, with its unrealistic yet manageable stupidity. Trashmasters followed in the footsteps of their name and created a trash game that took from Postal 2 what crazy people criticized it for, and many even sued it for—the brutality and lack of censorship (both verbal and physical).

I didn't and won't write much in the review, because the impressions of the second part still haunt me. I liked the game so much that I didn't trust anyone and bought the third part. If you're a fan of the game or just want to get acquainted with Postal, this game is not worth buying, or even looking at. I don't recommend this game. At the time of writing, the price is an unrealistic 399 rubles, which is way too much for it. I bought it for 80+ rubles, hoping that at least I wouldn't hate it, but alas, it turned out to be the opposite. 
I want to note that this situation with the game series reminds me of FlatOut. If you remember (and if not, look it up), after the success of [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/2990/FlatOut_2/]FlatOut 2[/url] and [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/12360/FlatOut_Ultimate_Carnage/]Ultimate Carnage[/url], the series was taken over by Team 6 Studio, who released [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/201510/Flatout_3_Chaos__Destruction/]Flatout 3: Chaos & Destruction[/url], which collected a bunch of negative reviews and... I will say from my own experience that the cult FlatOut series was simply denigrated."

But yet I still love the cheesy Postal humour but that's also another thing that bugs me, this was meant to follow Postal 2, one of my all time favourite games.

Like I say tricky situation but I've actually just had to grit my teeth at the crashes and keep pushing forward through the game, it's funny in places, in others not so much. The missions feel tiresome, just repeatedly escorting NPC's and killing hordes of feminists and terrorists. It's incredibly short but has a free roam once you complete the main story, I've yet to find any side missions aside from doing the achievements. That's a great shame to be honest.

If I put this down as just another third person shooter, I'd probably give it a positive rating, it's got all custom content, a main story, a free roam and decent voice acting. But if I put it down as the sequel to Postal 2. I'd have to gave it a negative straight away. Though, with their now being a Postal 2 DLC known as Paradise Lost, I guess I can class that as the true sequel to Postal 2. Therefore this game ain't all that bad, just don't expect it to be anywhere near as good as it's predecessors."

世を騒がせるお下劣ゲームPOSTALの第三作目（だったらしい）。
2はオープンワールドおつかいFPSだったが、 3では1本道のステージ型TPSとなった。

レビューも低評価ばかりが並んでいるがそれもそのはず、このゲーム、明らかに未完成のままだからだ。
当初は本家RWSが開発していたそうだがAkellaへと開発が移り、RWSは監修に回った事や、度重なる発売延期によって発表から発売まで7年もの歳月を要した経緯を考えると、開発が順調には進まずに難産であったことが伺える。
実際にプレイしてみて思ったが、ある程度豊富な武器の数々に作り込まれたステージやオブジェクトなど、下地はしっかりとしたTPSゲームと言った印象ではある。
しかしながら、後述するAIの問題や大量のバグ、動作問題によって全てが台無しとなってしまっている。
デバッグ作業と修正を繰り返せば解決しそうな問題ばかりではあるので非常に勿体ないように思うのだが・・・
修正する技術力が無いのか、はたまた資金繰りに苦しんでいたのか、理由は謎だが未完成のままリリースしてしまったと言ったところだろう。
そんな未完成のままのゲームに発売当初は40ドルもの価格設定をしていたのだから気が狂っている。

やはり幾ら何でもAIが余りにも酷すぎる。
銃撃戦では敵も味方も、カバーはせず、敵の目の前までダッシュした後に数秒棒立ちをかました後に撃ち始めるので、誰が敵か味方か分からず戦場はごちゃ混ぜ状態で正にカオス。
さらに非武装の住人達も叫んだり助けを呼んでおきながら平気で射線へと突入してくるので誤射が常に発生してしまうためにもうどうしようもない。コイツらみんなDNA同じじゃねえのか？

TPSではおなじみのカバーアクションもあるが、カバーしながらの移動が遅すぎる、銃の構えた向きとクロスヘアが一致しないなどはまだ笑える方で、カバー中に壁にめり込んでその場にスタックしてしまう事が高頻度で発生する為に、全く使い物にならない。

そしてそんな不完全なゲームにトドメを刺しにくる、凄まじく不安定な動作。
ステージによっては、フレームレートが 30fpsを切ることもも珍しく無い。そして挙げ句の果てには強制終了の嵐。
特にラスボス戦は酷く、特定の場所へ移動すると大抵クラッシュする。
死んだ回数よりも強制終了させられた回数の方が多かった程だ。
そんなイライラさせられた状態で、ロード中に表示される中指を立てた無能映画監督、ウーヴェ・ボルの画像を長時間見せつけられるので、どんな聖人君子でもハラワタが煮え繰り返るだろう。
前作のPOSTAL 2も非常に動作の重い、不安定なゲームではあったがその比では無いほどの不安定ぶりでこのゲームの未完成ぶりを改めて認識させられる。
お前のマシン性能がゴミだからだろ？と思われる方もいるかもしれませんが、割とその通りなので、PCスペックに自信のある方には是非体験してもらいたいです。

AIや動作問題を置いておいても、やはり面白みに欠けた作品であると言わざるを得ない。
ミッション内容も大半はこちらに歯向かってくる敵の集団との銃撃戦ばかりだからだ。
2よりもシューター要素の出来こそは良くなってはいるものの、やはり前述のAIが全てをぶち壊している。
POSTALは過去のシリーズでの売りであった残虐要素、つまりプレイヤーが何の罪もない住人達に銃を乱射し、瀕死の者や命乞いをする者の頭部を吹っ飛ばしてトドメを刺した暁には遺体に火を付けたり遺体を損壊して小便をぶっかけたりなど、誰もが心の奥底に持つ残虐性を存分に引き出させ、この狂った社会に中指を立てる、それこそがPOSTALと言う作品の醍醐味だった。
だが3ではそんな過去の伝統を完全に忘れてしまい、平凡なTPSへと成り果ててしまった。
ゲーム内容が褒められた物で有れば、従来のファンを黙らせられたし、3で新たなファンも獲得出来たであろう。
しかし現実は、凡作とすら呼べないバグまみれの未完成品。
結果として、クソゲー好きがドヤ顔でプレイしてレビューを書くだけのためにあるゲームにしかならなかった。


・さいごに
3がこんな不出来で結果的には良かったように思います。
もし、3が中途半端に良作であったならば・・・POSTAL 2がGreenLightに登録されSteamで発売される事も、10年越しのDLCであるParadise Lostがリリースされる事も、初代がPOSTAL Reduxとしてリメイクされる事も無く、今では忘れ去られてしまったかもしれない・・・
そう考えると、3が良くも悪くもネタになってくれたおかげ？であると個人的には感じています。
しかしながら、他の方々も述べられている通り、3はPOSTALの名を騙った詐欺作品であるので、是非POSTAL、POSTAL2 (Paradise Lost)、POSTAL Reduxを買いましょう。

This is the third installment (or so it seems) in the controversial, vulgar game series POSTAL.
2 was an open-world errand-running FPS, while 3 is a linear, stage-based TPS.

The reviews are overwhelmingly negative, and that's no surprise, as this game is clearly unfinished. Apparently, development was originally handled by the original RWS, but then shifted to Akella, with RWS acting as supervisor. Considering the seven years it took from announcement to release due to repeated delays, it's clear that development was difficult and didn't go smoothly.
Having played the game, I got the impression that it was a solid TPS game with a fairly wide selection of weapons and well-crafted stages and objects.
However, the AI ​​issues, numerous bugs, and performance problems, which I'll discuss later, ruin it all.
These are all issues that could have been resolved with repeated debugging and fixes, so it's a shame...
Whether they didn't have the technical ability to fix them or were struggling with funding, it's a mystery, but it seems like they released it unfinished.
It's crazy that they initially priced such an unfinished game at $40.

The AI ​​is just way too terrible, no matter how you look at it.
During gunfights, neither enemy nor ally takes cover. Instead, they dash right in front of the enemy and stand there for a few seconds before starting to fire, making it impossible to tell who is friend or foe, resulting in a chaotic battlefield.

Furthermore, unarmed residents will rush into the line of fire while screaming or calling for help, resulting in constant accidental fire and nothing you can do about it. Aren't they all in the same DNA?

There is the usual TPS cover action, but the fact that movement while taking cover is too slow and the direction your gun is aimed and your crosshairs don't line up is still laughable, and you frequently get stuck stuck in a wall while taking cover, making it completely unusable.

And to top it off, the game is incredibly unstable.

It's not uncommon for the frame rate to drop below 30fps in some stages. And to top it all off, the game crashes frequently.
The final boss battle is particularly bad, and it usually crashes when you move to a certain location.
I had to force quit more times than I died.
Putting on such a frustrating state, and then being bombarded with an image of incompetent film director Uwe Boll giving the middle finger while loading for such a long time, would make even the most saintly person boil over.
The previous game, POSTAL 2, was also extremely slow and unstable, but this game's instability is on the whole even more so, reminding us all just how unfinished it is.
Some of you might think, ""It's because your machine's performance is rubbish,"" and that's quite true, so I would definitely recommend anyone with confident PC specs to give it a try.

Even putting aside the AI ​​and performance issues, I have to say it's still lacking in excitement.
Most of the missions consist of nothing but gunfights with groups of enemies constantly attacking you.
While the shooter elements are better than in POSTAL 2, the aforementioned AI still ruins everything.
POSTAL retained the brutality that was a selling point of previous games in the series. Players could open fire on innocent residents, blow off the heads of those on the verge of death or begging for their lives, and then set fire to the bodies, mutilate them, and urinate on them, bringing out the cruelty that lies deep within everyone's hearts and giving the middle finger to this crazy society. That was the true joy of POSTAL.

But POSTAL 3 completely forgot about these past traditions and devolved into a mediocre TPS.

If the game's content had been praised, it would have silenced existing fans and even gained new ones.

But the reality is that it's an unfinished product riddled with bugs that can't even be called mediocre.

As a result, it's nothing more than a game that exists only for crap game fans to play with a smug look on their face and write reviews.

-In conclusion
I think it was a good thing that POSTAL 3 was so poorly made.
If 3 had been even moderately good... POSTAL 2 would never have been Greenlighted and released on Steam, the decade-long DLC ​​Paradise Lost would never have been released, and the original game might never have been remade as POSTAL Redux, and it might have been forgotten by now...
In that sense, I personally feel that it's thanks to 3, for better or worse, that it has become a topic of conversation.
However, as others have said, 3 is a scam using the POSTAL name, so you should definitely buy POSTAL, POSTAL 2 (Paradise Lost), and POSTAL Redux.

- Melee weapons and fists are impossible to use.

- Running with Scissors seems to ignore the third installment of Postal and seems to prioritize the second installment, pushing it to the forefront.

They frequently release patches to remove bugs and fix various issues with POSTAL 2.

And Postal 3 is left to its own devices with its problems, its poor optimization, and the lack of many features that were in POSTAL 2.

But all in all, it's not such a bad game. If you don't consider the fact that it's the sequel to POSTAL 2,

","The Postal series was a fantastic game. I didn't play the first one, but I did play the second one. The second one was a very over-developed game, great because of the story, which was a bit lackluster, but I still liked it overall. The second and third installments run on the Source engine, a very good company from Valve, known for CS:GO, Half Life 2, among other things.
Postal 3 has changed beyond recognition since the second one. Unfortunately, there's no good news here. The game is completely poorly optimized. Almost 90% of the time, it's noticeable that it's sluggish, running at max 30 or 40 frames per second, more often at 30 FPS. Another downside is the poor playability, even though the gameplay has completely changed. It didn't do any good because I had to struggle on the very easy difficulty to beat the first part of the game. But as for the graphics, it's much better, even though the game still runs on the same engine as CS:GO and Half Life 2.
Unfortunately, when it comes to weapons, the developer removed some of the weapons known from the original. 2, which further contributes to the game's negative rating. Ultimately, I don't recommend the game unless you want to get stressed out. I rate the game 4/10."

upd:
Спасибо платформе ZOOM, правообладателям бренда ""Акелла"" и RWS за то, что пропатчили Стимовскую версию Postal 3 и вернули её в продажу. Игра больше не вылетает при броске гранат и различных предметов. DRM-защита вырезана. Ещё кое-где оптимизация игры стала лучше. С удовольствием пройду третью часть ещё раз назло ярым фанатам Posral 4: Без сожалений. И, конечно же, жду релиз мода Catharsis Reborn и Postal 3 Unreal!","The Postal 3 community is still alive and well and continues to create guides with various fixes. Thanks to everyone who hasn't forgotten about this game. It's not as bad as it seems.

upd:
Thanks to the ZOOM platform, the Akella brand rights holders, and RWS for patching the Steam version of Postal 3 and bringing it back for sale. The game no longer crashes when throwing grenades and other objects. DRM protection has been removed. Optimization has also improved in some areas. I'll happily play through the third installment again, to spite the ardent Postal 4 fans: No Regrets. And, of course, I'm looking forward to the release of the Catharsis Reborn mod and Postal 3 Unreal!"

N'attendez pas de retrouver un Postal II bis (apres tout postal 2 n'a pas grand chose en commun avec postal I ) un monde semi ouvert, où vous vous baladez et faite ce que vous voulez. Non là ce sont des suites de niveaux, comme postal I, dans lesquels vous aurez différents ""mini-jeu"" à faire. Et c'est tout. Si de faire des suites de mini-jeux dans des niveaux fermés ne vous tente pas, alors n'achetez pas ce jeu, c'est tout ce qu'il a à vous offrir. 
Il y a des idées sympatifque, comme le fait d'avoir des missions ""bien"" et des missions ""mal"", ce qui donne un peu de rejouabilité. Certe l'humour ne m'a pas fait autant mouche que le deuxième, je le trouve moins ""fin"" que le deuxième ( à supposer qu'on puisse parler de finesse avec Portal X) ), mais certains moment m'ont quand meme bien fait rire. C'est pas du grand gameplay mais perso c'est pas pour le gameplay que je joue à ce jeu. Et finalement j'ai été au premier abord dessus comme beaucoup, parceque je ne m'attendais pas à ca, mais j'ai laissé une chance au jeu et finalement je m'amuse bien.","A large part of the negative reviews are there, in my opinion, because this isn't what people were expecting. Don't expect to find a Postal II bis (after all, Postal 2 doesn't have much in common with Postal I) a semi-open world, where you wander around and do what you want. No, these are series of levels, like Postal I, in which you will have different ""mini-games"" to do. And that's it. If doing series of mini-games in closed levels doesn't tempt you, then don't buy this game; that's all it has to offer.
There are some nice ideas, like having ""good"" missions and ""bad"" missions, which gives a bit of replayability. Certainly the humor didn't hit me as hard as the second one, I find it less ""fine"" than the second one (assuming we can talk about finesse with Portal X) ), but some moments still made me laugh. It's not great gameplay but personally it's not for the gameplay that I play this game. And finally I was on it at first like many, because I didn't expect that, but I gave the game a chance and finally I'm having fun."

The style is kinda okay and its no suprise that the story is incredibly goofy. But the game also overdoes it on the memes and hommages too, even for Postal standards.

A) Endure the good path and try not redecorate your PC with an Axe every single time you accidentely blast any retarded civilians in the crossfire of some of the most chaotic, and frustratingly broken fights you'l ever see, or:

B) Go nuts on a ""less"" enduring bad path and then get shat on because you went with the bad path this time so you wont get a proper bossfight, escape sequence and better ending (or maybe it's actually a good thing, because it makes the game abit shorter and you can do something useful instead)

As for the gameplay itself: Small missions with (mostly) straightforward objectives and little room for freeroaming, AI wonks out all the time, melee feels unresponsive, special weapons are either useless or only do what they feel like, and using any throwable weapons is a gamecrashing shortcut to exit this infuriatingly glitchy game.

Дeрьмовый угар отечественного производства. Игру, мало похожую на вторую часть. Чувство, будто половину негативных обзоров написали фанатики RWS, а другую -  те, кто не смог заставить третий Постал работать. Линейные задания, без свободы действий, но с выбором пути. Прыжки? Хрен вам, а не прыжки. Но теперь есть укрытия! 
Что нас ждëт?
Для начала - первое и самое сложное задание - запустить игру. Ибо даже переклеенная патчами она может не заработать. У меня даже каким-то хреном проснулся дохлый активатор ключей. Но, в конечном итоге, игра ожила. Наполовину. Баги никто не отменял.
После ну прямо охрененного обучения, и кучи катсцен разной степени абсурдности, нас пускают собирать пылесосом обдрюченные салфетки, ловить кошек, при этом бегая от гуков, и, в один прекрасный момент, выбрать путь, по которому вы будете идти, и который, в зависимости от вашего поведения, будет меняться.
Кстати, о абсурде. Его здесь до задницы, игра наполнена им до краëв. Отстреливаете усатых террористов в мексиканском городке, раздалбливаете венесуэльскую армию во главе с Уго Чавесом на танке, Давите яжмамаш, геев-байкеров, за-дротов (ну ** твою мать, Стим, это слово разве настолько вульгарно?) , защитников животных, работаете копом и участвуете в спецоперации, направляете макаку/пса лазерной указкой И всë это в одной игре. Всë приправлено матом и юмором, по большей части про ж**ы, г**но и ч**ны. Честно, это самая эпичная хрень, которую я проходил за последнее время.
Итак, что в итоге? 
Собранный программными обезьянами под руководством Акеллы, на отъе**сь , но весëлый продукт, доставляющий веселье, видимо, наглухо отбитым психам без крыши, одним из коих я и являюсь.
И самое главное - забудьте всë, чему вас учил второй Постал. Здесь свои правила и законы.","On someone's recommendation, I bought this piece of crap. On sale. I can't seriously pay 400 rubles for it. What did I get?
A piece of domestically produced crap. A game that bears little resemblance to the second game. It feels like half the negative reviews were written by RWS fanatics, and the other half by those who couldn't get the third one to work. Linear missions, no freedom of action, but with a choice of paths. Jumping? No jumping, no jumping. But now there's cover!
What awaits us?
First of all, the first and most difficult task is to launch the game. Because even with patches, it might not work. For some reason, I even woke up a dead key activator. But, in the end, the game came back to life. Halfway. Bugs are still there. After a seriously awesome tutorial and a bunch of cutscenes of varying degrees of absurdity, we're sent to vacuum up soggy napkins, catch cats while running from gooks, and, at one point, choose a path to take, which will change depending on your behavior.

Speaking of absurdity. There's a ton of it here; the game is filled to the brim with it. You shoot mustachioed terrorists in a Mexican town, smash the Venezuelan army led by Hugo Chavez in a tank, crush moms, gay bikers, nerds (for fuck's sake, Steam, is that word that vulgar?), animal rights activists, work as a cop and participate in a special operation, direct a macaque/dog with a laser pointer. And all this in one game. Everything is spiced up with profanity and humor, mostly about asses, shit, and dicks. Honestly, this is the most epic crap I've played in a while.
So, what's the bottom line?
Collected by software monkeys under Akella's direction, it's a fucked-up, but fun product that apparently brings joy to completely insane, brain-dead crazies, of which I am one.

The problem that makes it hard for me to even finish the damn game is that it doesn't get enough things right to be a decent or below average but playable game and feels more like a chore.

In simple terms, the bad outweighs the good with this title (I legitimately need to push myself to finish the game)

But, lets get a few positives out of the way, which there are


1-Humor and Feel-At it's heart the Postal games have been all about ultra violence, parodies of pop culture, culture itself, and many topics, and gross/grim humor. (regarding the first two games, I consider Postal 1 and redux games in the series, but they are their own ""animals"" if you will) You can think of Postal as Duke Nukem meets South Park, and thankfully, Postal 3 does do well in the humor department, making fun of everything from soccer moms to Uwe Boll (who does make a cameo, which makes it funnier imo) to crooked politicians


2-Open World, precisely GTA style open world-This is a nice unexplored style of game that Postal has yet to explore, which is a (imo) fun and interesting way to go about the your mentally unstable endeavors with the game

Weapon Variety-The game keeps one of Postal's other key elements and manages to take care of that well, that being the over the top, ridiculous, and uncanny weapons selection, with classics like the crazy cat and shovel to new things like beehives and  a badger saw

Unfortunately, this is where the positives end, and the negatives start charging at you like an aggressive cat (as you can tell I've tried the other games)

1-Barren Open World-The idea of an open world for a game like this GTA style is great, what isn't is there is literally nothing to do other than rampage and destroy cars and massacre people. Now don't get me wrong, that was one of the points of postal, but it wasn't the only one, others were exploring buildings and vast environments, interacting with the world in comedic and ridiculous ways, and digging around for secrets amd easter eggs. To make an open world that is so desolate and with so little to do is a major missed oppertunity

2-Combat-While the gunplay isn't a train and weapon variety in it of itself is nice, what isn't is how ""floaty"" and unbalanced it is for lack of a better term. Melee combat legitimately takes getting used to and timing to hit foes properly and you might as well not move at all while using melee weapons or your fists, because you will be swinging around like a chicken with it's head cut off otherwise. As for guns, aiming can be slow like molasses as you barely move at all as you aim and not to mention that the weapons and damage feels off balance (a shotgun blast that is very close at times won't even take someone down, they just get back up) You are literally better off sticking to the best to use weapons in the game (pistol, m16, and machine gun) rather than anything else

The biggest thing that would otherwise make this at least a below average or PLAYABLE game however,is the bugs, I feel like you might need to call a fucking exterminator its so buggy in this game

Everything from AI acting unresponsive, leaving themselves open, or not following you around when you tell them to move, to the game going slow and laggy (even in compatibility mode with windows 7) to even crashing when you UNLOCK AN ACHIEVEMENT at times, and you have a game that tries to drain you of your energy with how buggy it can be)

This would be a ""meh"" title if it weren't for the bugs, optimization issues, and just overall lackluster feel/vibes Postal 3 gives off, but as brought up beforehand, the few nice things about the game UNDOUBTEDLY aren't enough to make this an average title, and there's so many problems it can be unbearable, I honestly just hope RWS learned their lesson (no offense to the company) about licensing out their games to the right developer and maybe we might see a re-release of this game in house which would be 1000x better, or maybe Postal 4 or a new game that'll blow this out of the water, until then, just focus on Postal 2 and Paradise Lost

 - кривой физики;
 - офигительные задания в виде ""убей 69 таллибов, чтобы победить"";

Gameplay tellement basique et raide qu'ils ont même foirer la visé ! Avec le moteur SOURCE !!! Optimisation aux fraises et crash souvent. Pratiquement aucune imagination que cela soit au niveau du level design que des armes.

Gameplay so basic and stiff that they even messed up the aiming! With the SOURCE engine!!! Optimization is poor and crashes frequently. Practically no imagination, whether in terms of level design or weapons.
And just seeing the photo of Uwe Boll as soon as you launch the game makes me want to vomit. But I admit I enjoyed killing him. Speaking of humor, it's simple: you're using the same type of humor as ""What have we done to God?"" FUCKING walking clichés. In the second game, they were well managed, but this one, FUCK!!

No, I sincerely advise you not to play this third installment and stick with the first two. Plus, the DLC they released a year or three ago is way superior to this game. And you'll get it for less, so the choice is easy."

 Aqui les Explico el porque: 
 Se que es basura, que esta lleno de bugs y que, tiene un humor negro y ofensivo. 
 Pero aun asi, logra cometer su objetivo de entrenerme, tanto sea por lo malo que esta programado, tanto sea, como los enemigos caen como si fuesen trapos al rozarles mientras corres, o matarlos de un disparo en la cabeza, con hasta una aspiradora. 
 La historia, es ridicula y estupida, y que, solo brinda ocaciones bizarras, solo para divertir. Ya sea, Mexicanos chinos y Musulmanes que quieren matarte por que estas cumpliendo tu mision de capturar gatos con SIDA o proteger manzanas de unos hippies Armados hasta los dientes. 
 Ya saben, estereotipos mesclados, que dan risa a primera vista, luego, incomoda.
 Lo unico que lo salva, es la Banda sonora, que para mi PARECER, esta muy bien lograda, pero mal implementada, pero, se nota mucho talento desperdiciado en este juego. Desde musica MIDI, con toques sensillos, pasando por solos de guitarra al estilo COUNTRY, Luego Metal, o Alternativa, hasta lleguar a Remixes EDM.
 Tambíen cabe destacar, de que, al explorar el juego (cosa muy lamentable que te dejen hacer, como recompensa, por completarlo, y no como se debe en un principio. Como la impresión que nos dieron en P2) se nota muchisimo, de que si AKELLA(empresa Rusa, famosa por crear mods raros y regulares, de el juego anterior) hubiese tenido mas tiempo para terminar este juego, al menos, hubiese estado mas pulido y jugable.
 Es una lastima que RWS no pueda mejorar este juego, debido a politicas con Akella. 
 Es una pena.","This piece of crap is my guilty pleasure.
Here's why:
I know it's garbage, it's full of bugs, and it has dark and offensive humor.
But even so, it manages to fulfill its goal of entertaining me, whether it's because of its poor programming, or whether it's because enemies fall like rags when you brush against them while running, or whether it's because you kill them with a shot to the head, or even with a vacuum cleaner.
The story is ridiculous and stupid, and it only offers bizarre occasions just for fun. Whether it's Chinese Mexicans and Muslims who want to kill you because you're fulfilling your mission of capturing cats with AIDS or protecting apples from heavily armed hippies.
You know, mixed stereotypes that are funny at first glance, but then become uncomfortable.
The only saving grace is the soundtrack, which, in my opinion, is very well done, but poorly implemented. However, it's clear that a lot of talent is wasted in this game. From MIDI music with simple touches, to country-style guitar solos, then metal, or alternative, to EDM remixes.
It's also worth noting that when exploring the game (which is a very unfortunate thing they let you do as a reward for completing it, and not as you should have done initially. Like the impression we got in P2), it's very clear that if AKELLA (a Russian company famous for creating rare and regular mods of the previous game) had had more time to finish this game, at least it would have been more polished and playable.
It's a shame that RWS can't improve this game due to policies with Akella.

- multiple bugs, glitches that makes you even restart the damn game
- Postal III a.k.a The Definition of Crashing
- Dude's voice acting...the way Postal 2 dude says quotes sounds BADA$$, but the way Postal 3 dude says quotes sounds so lazy and boring
- sh#tty dark humor that can only make a 10 year old laugh (let's not forget this is a M rated game)
- oh you remember how i said how achievements can be challenging ? well it's because they are so BUGGY
- repetitive story...you get your ""sh#tty job"" you do it, you fail to get paid, you go to do another ""sh#tty job"" of yours
- melee weapons ? don't bother using them
- in Postal 2 you can pee for 2 hours...but in this game you can pee for 2 seconds
- AI is so f@cking retarded in this game that you might aswell play the game with your eyes closed so you wouldn't have to see their stupid actions
- cover system is USELESS
- cutscenes look worse than the gameplay itself
- sound effects (best solution is to mute the game sound and just leave the music sound)
- you have to beat this buggy piece of crap in order to unlock free roam and then again...the free roam is SOOOO boring because all you can do is kill a bunch of innocent people that wont even fight back and give you a challenge
- Uwe Boll is in this game
- it's full price right now is 11.99 when it should be for free imo
- don't you think i should stop now ?
Okay i think you get the point now. What i DON'T reccomend ?
DO NOT buy this game for 11.99 just wait for the sale if you're a hardcore POSTAL fan
What i reccomend ?
Get a Postal 3 disc so you could pee on it or just buy Postal 2 instead
Final score:3/10
I REGRET EVERYTHING

Also don't forget to pray for those who bought this for 59.99","*sigh* okay so i bought this for 3.72 if im not wrong and as a POSTAL fan i didn't wanted to be an a$$hole so decided to give this game a chance and oh boy was i wrong...
before i talk bad about this game, i'm gonna try and add some good things about it aswell
+best thing about this game is the soundtrack. It is one of the best video game soundtracks i ever heard and it fits the game PERFECTLY
+decent voice acting (not for the main character)
+cool new weapons like HIV cats or bees that you can throw at people and watch them getting ripped apart
+some cool and challenging achievements you can get in this game
+follows the same story as the 2nd game:Dude goes to another sh@thole a.k.a Catharsis, does his ""$hitty jobs"" for people and tries to make cash for the trip while he meets more a$$hole people that hate him and wants to kill him
+violence and gore just as the previous ones
+you can choose a good/evil path blah blah blah and get a good/evil ending blah blah blah

Серия Postal переживала не лучшие времена. Postal 1 была коммерчески не успешна, а 2 часть еле сводила концы с концами. Спасать серию из глубин забвения вызвался лучший российский издатель Акелла. Только они смоги вытянуть загнивающую серию на новый уровень и вдохнуть в неё вторую жизнь. Итак, перед нами творение господине. Свет надежды в пучине загнивающей индустрии Postal 3. 

Сюжет: Достойный самых смелых и лучших литературных произведений. С первых секунд игры становиться ясно что перед нами нечто большее, чем просто игра. Это целая жизнь, которую мы будет проживать на наших голубых экранах. Глубокомысленное и непосредственное, прекрасное и в тоже время ужасное творение высокоинтеллектуальных умов достопочтенных мужей и прекрасных дам. Простому человеку не хватает хромосом, чтобы осознать всю гениальность данного произведения искусства. Благо авторы были снабжены лишней частичкой и смогли создать такое божественное великолепие. Потрясающая Миссия в секс-шопе. Сбор пылесосом дрочи и последующее её кидание в буйных протестующих феминисток. Всё это выполнено в прекрасных сюжетных рамках и с глубоким посылом который может осознать далеко не каждый человек. Кража котов у шаурмистов или доставка гироскутеров из точки в точку. Простой человек никогда бы не додумался до таких гениальных идей. Данное произведение искусства достойно лучших представителей литературного жанра 

Геймплей: Такой проработанной и сбалансированной боевой системы не было еще ни в одной игре. Создаётся впечатление, что ты играешь в реальную жизнь с первых секунд нашего эпичного похода. От данного действа нереально оторвать глаз 

Графика: Игра опередила время на многие века вперёд. Кажется, что разработчики создали в закромах машину времени и переместились на 150 лет вперёд, дабы подсмотреть инопланетные технологии. Такой потрясающей графики нет ни в одной игре. Естественно её могут потянуть только самые дорогие в мире компьютеры.

Визуальный стиль и музыка: Видно, что дизайнеры долгие годы черпали вдохновение. Античность, ренессанс, готика в этой игре смешиваются практически все жанры. Выдавая настоящий букет благоговений и восхитительную палитру красок. Данный стиль может сравниться только с лучшими современными картинами. Музыкальное сопровождение напоминает божественную симфонию. Такого вы не услышите даже в нетленных шедеврах классиков. Данный стиль и качество можно сравнить пожалуй только с Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin. 

Итог: Это не игра. Это целая религия, религия имени Акеллы во всех проявлениях. На данный шедевр стоит исключительно молиться и петь ему всяческие хвалебные песни. 

1.0/10 хуже может быть только секс с мёртвой бабушкой, ночью при свечах","Postal III - Divine Symphony

The Postal series was going through hard times. Postal 1 was commercially unsuccessful, and the second installment was barely making ends meet. Akella, Russia's leading publisher, stepped in to rescue the series from the depths of oblivion. Only they were able to lift the decaying series to a new level and breathe new life into it. So, before us is the masterpiece of our lords. A light of hope in the depths of a decaying industry: Postal 3.

Plot: Worthy of the boldest and finest literary works. From the first seconds of the game, it becomes clear that this is more than just a game. This is an entire life, which we will experience on our screens. A profound and spontaneous, beautiful and at the same time terrifying creation of the highly intellectual minds of venerable men and beautiful women. The average person lacks the chromosomes to comprehend the full genius of this work of art. Luckily, the authors were equipped with an extra bit of creativity and were able to create such divine splendor. A stunning mission in a sex shop. Vacuuming up masturbation and then throwing it at violent feminist protesters. All of this is executed within a beautifully crafted narrative framework and with a profound message that not everyone can grasp. Stealing cats from shawarma vendors or delivering hoverboards from point to point. An ordinary person would never have come up with such brilliant ideas. This work of art is worthy of the best literary genres.

Gameplay: Such a well-developed and balanced combat system has never been seen in a game before. It feels like you're playing real life from the very first seconds of our epic campaign. It's impossible to tear your eyes away from this action.

Graphics: The game is centuries ahead of its time. It's as if the developers built a time machine and traveled 150 years into the future to spy on alien technology. No other game has such stunning graphics. Naturally, only the world's most expensive computers can handle them.

Visual style and music: It's clear the designers have been drawing inspiration for years. Antiquity, Renaissance, and Gothic are blended in this game, blending virtually every genre, producing a true bouquet of awe and a delightful palette of colors. This style can only be compared to the best modern paintings. The musical accompaniment is reminiscent of a divine symphony. You won't hear something like this even in the timeless masterpieces of the classics. This style and quality can perhaps only be compared to Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin.

Bottom line: This isn't a game. It's an entire religion, the religion of Akella in all its forms. This masterpiece deserves nothing but prayer and praise.

Поражает скорее даже не сама игра, а история её создания. Проще говоря, была такая студия Trashmasters (чувствуете иронию?), которая просила бабок у Акеллы для создания сиквела к посталу. Благо Акелла ещё ранее купила частичные права на продукцию по посталу у RWS, высрав дополнении Штопор Жжот с юмором, который ещё в 2006 казался маразмом. Так вот, данная студия в основном сделала говно-демку на движке source со странной моделью ГГ, а большую часть времени выклянчивала бабки у Акеллы на новых омаров к белому вину, видимо. Спустя где-то пару лет результатов всё не было. Акелле пришло гениальное решение. Отправить состав Trashmasters в офис RWS, чтобы те набрались опыта. Как итог, трешоделы опять же жрали омаров с белым вином, только уже вместе с составом RWS. К году так 2011-му, Акелла всё таки заставила студию работать. Сама же студия жаловалась, что денег мало, дайте дескать ещё. На что Акелла ответила нет и издала сырой недоделанный шлак, который видно, что делали на коленке пару месяцев. Это ещё не говоря об оптимизации. Хз, что надо сделать, чтобы заставить лагать Source, который что только не тащит на древних машинах, но у трешоделов это получилось...",

Postal 3 - gra która rzekomo miała mieć swoją premiere w 2009 roku.Jest to trzecia odsłona przygód Kolesia, protagonisty znanego z dwóch poprzednich częśći i dodatku Apocalypse Weekend z 2004 roku. Gra niestety ukazała się parę lat później, nie wiem jednak dlaczego.Gra nie jest najgorsza ale najlepsza też nie jest.

Plusy:
-Koleś i cała masa tego specyficznego dla serii humoru i przedstawienia świata powracają i wylewają swoją specyficzność na nowe miasto , w którym się znalazły.Czyli prostymi słowami ujmując nadal jest fajnie i głupkowato.
-Arsenał i przedmioty ,których jest całkiem sporo.
-Strzelanie i odpadające fragmenty ciała sprawiają frajdę

Pomiędzy:
-Prosota i liniowość rozrywki może niektórym odbiorcom przypaść do gustu
-Fabuła może się podobać

Minusy:
-Krótka 4-6 h
-Miasteczko, po którym się poruszamy jest malutkie i niezbyt zjawiskowe
-Tryb swobodoby odblokowujemy dopiero po przejściu wątku fabularnego
-Oprócz strzelania, jazdy pojazdem z przyszłośći (elektryczny dwukołowiec) i interakcją z syfami za pomocą odkurzacza nie ma nic innego do roboty. Zabrakło możliwości interakcji widocznej w drugiej częśći (kupno róznych artykułów,broni etc.)
-Artificial Intelligence w tej grze to dno, choć w drugiej części nie było też kolorowo, ale tutaj każdy człek jest upośledzony.
-Błędy, na przykład z misjami , w których musimy kogoś eskartować są zniszczone. Każdy NPC , którego mamy eskortować nie musi być objęty jakąkolwiek opięka, nawet jak go zostawimy na początku i nie będzie za nami podążał to i tak z powodzeniem skończymi misje o ile dotrzemy do punktu wyjścia a nasz NPC nie zginie.

Bez konkluzji.Polecam zakupić grę na przecenie bo za 43,99zł nie warto, wierzcie mi.","Another installment in a well-known series, but is it a valid one? My review will be objective and straightforward.

Postal 3 – a game supposedly released in 2009. It's the third installment in the adventures of the Dude, the protagonist from the two previous installments and the 2004 Apocalypse Weekend expansion. Unfortunately, the game was released a few years later, but I don't know why. It's not the worst game, but it's not the best either.

Pros:
- The Dude and all the humor and world-building that characterize the series return and spill their unique flavor onto the new city they find themselves in. Simply put, it's still fun and goofy.
- The arsenal and items, of which there are quite a few. - Shooting and body parts falling off are fun.

Between:
- The simplicity and linearity of the gameplay may appeal to some players.
- The storyline may be enjoyable.

Cons:
- Short, 4-6 hours.
- The town you play through is tiny and not particularly impressive.
- Freemode is unlocked only after completing the story.
- Besides shooting, driving a vehicle from the future (an electric two-wheeler), and interacting with trash with a vacuum cleaner, there's nothing else to do. The interaction options seen in the second game (buying various items, weapons, etc.) are missing.
- The Artificial Intelligence in this game is abysmal, although the second game wasn't exactly glamorous either, but everyone here is at a disadvantage.
- Bugs, for example, with missions where you have to escort someone, are completely destroyed. Each NPC we're supposed to escort doesn't need to be under any care. Even if we leave them at the beginning and they don't follow us, we'll still successfully complete the mission as long as we reach the starting point and our NPC doesn't die.

No conclusions. I recommend buying the game on sale because, trust me, it's not worth it at 43.99 PLN."

EDIT 2.0: I guess the bullet points don't show up on the store page, so you have to actually click on the review to get a cleaner version. Sorry for Steam being trashy.

I'm just going to sum up this review in a very large pros v cons list because I feel like that would be best for this game.
[list][h1]Pros:[/h1]
[*] Unlike the 2nd game, there is no backtracking and instead there are missions
[*] The good/bad system is pretty neat and you can get different missions depending on how you decide to behave
[*] A majority of the humor is on-par with the 2nd game
[*] The models look nice and the voice acting is done very well
[*] Some of the missions are very enjoyable and are really fun to play through
[*] Ron Jeremy is in the game
[/list]
[list][h1]Cons:[/h1]
[*] The average fps, especially in gunfights, is in the mid teens, just like Kevin Spacey
[*] The game has really bad crash issues and during my playthrough crashed over 15 times total
[*] Some of the missions are really drawn out and boring
[*] The health regen system, you can't manually heal yourself, so you actually have to take cover
[*] The cover system sucks.  Numerous times I was shot through walls and died from an enemy around a corner
[*] Aiming while in cover is nearly impossible and most of the time you can still be shot while sitting in cover
[*] The voice lines are repeated often and get super annoying within an hour or so
[*] When shooting the rocket launcher, it explodes as soon as it exits the chamber and blows up in your face
[*] The boss missions are the worst because the fps is awful and you need to make quick movements and accurate shots
[*] The sprinting system is odd, because sometimes it doesn't actually recharge and you cannot spring any more for that level
[*] The gunshots are so loud that you can barely hear the character over them
[*] The sounds are incredibly goofy because they're default source engine sounds. Think of cs:go noises in a comedy game.
[*] The pathing on the NPCs are terrible and often run in front of you while you're shooting, causing you to lose repuation.
[*] This doesn't feel anything like a postal game, other than the few tie-in characters from the 2nd game.
[*] The ""vehicle gameplay"" is just you riding on a segway for a mission and a half. It even jokes about it in the game.
[*] The weapon wheel is a pain to navigate and only a handful of items have hotkeys.
[*] A majority of the weapons feel incredibly useless compared to the weapons from the 2nd game.
[*] The game doesn't feel like a ""week in paradise"" and instead a bunch of ""boring accidents and meetups""
[*] Some of the weapons are a pain to use because they end up harming yourself or other civilians due to their awful pathing and the weapon's AOE
[*] On the lowest graphics options possible, it is near impossible to even read the main menu screen
[*] Alt+Tabbing causes the game to freeze and crash
[*] Sometimes after respawning you get a bug where you keep moving back and to the right.  To fix this, throw a grenade or restart the game.  Usually throwing the grenade crashes it anyways
[*] There's a chance that whenever you throw an item the game will crash
[*] Akella is a Russian dev team that dropped the ball hard on this game and even RWS says that this game is trash.  It is even referenced in the Paradise Lost DLC for POSTAL 2
[*] Running With Scissors is more fun than playing this dumpster fire
[*] I'd rather dunk my balls in boiling water than have to sit through this campaign again
[/list]

Don't consider buying this.  I thought that, ""It can't possibly be as bad as people are saying it is"".  I could have not been more wrong.  Playing this was absolutely frustrantingly rage-inducingly painful. The awful controls, the terrible framerate, the boring as hell missions, and the awful sound design make me want to vomit out an entire toddler. Do not spend your money on this. Do not support this developer. Stay far away from anything that they may make in the future. This is the biggest turd that I have ever bought and I would rather spend 15 days of my life in terrible achievement farming games than have to sit through another 5 hours of this filth.

Please don't consider buying this. Please don't think that it's a good deal. Please refund this if you can. Do not make the same mistake that I did. Please save your time and money. Please stay safe from the rage and frustration of this stinky doodie. Please save yourself.

[b]Overall Score for Postal III:[/b] 1 out of 5

With all of the above taken into consideration, the staff at RWS must have been drunk, high, or beamed back in time and dropped on their heads as babies when they made the decision to release this. The biggest reparation they could've made, and thankfully have as a company, was to totally disown P3 and mark Paradise Lost as the true successor in the P2/Apocalypse Weekend lineage, with Postal 4 continuing in a trend that they obviously know now is right. I can safely say, a thousand times over, if you really want a worthy sequel, give your money to these instead. If you buy this game, you are guaranteed disappointment. Playing with a zipper or a light switch is more gratifying.","Catharsis. Far from cathartic, and in no way relative to Paradise. Much like Gary, Indiana. Or Detroit.

[b]Overall Score for Postal III:[/b] 1 out of 5

With all of the above taken into consideration, the staff at RWS must have been drunk, high, or beamed back in time and dropped on their heads as babies when they made the decision to release this. The biggest reparation they could've made, and thankfully have as a company, was to totally disown P3 and mark Paradise Lost as the true successor in the P2/Apocalypse Weekend lineage, with Postal 4 continuing in a trend that they obviously know now is right. I can safely say, a thousand times over, if you really want a worthy sequel, give your money to these instead. If you buy this game, you are guaranteed disappointment. Playing with a zipper or a light switch is more gratifying."

No sé cómo os las habéis apañado para bajar tantísimo el listón. Esta porquería es injugable, de misiones repetitivas, dificultad enorme, teniendo en cuenta la mierda de jugabilidad que tiene, porque apuntar o INCLUSO MOVERSE por el entorno puede ser como ver a un pato borracho, bizco y con párkinson corriendo por un campo de minas (eso cuando el personaje no se buguea durante una cobertura y te hace reiniciar toda la puñetera misión porque ni siquiera eres capaz de moverte), en serio, por favor, no compréis esto.

I don't know how you managed to lower the bar so much.

Seriously, please don't buy this. I was expecting something like Postal 2, a beautiful amalgam of gratuitous violence, dark humor, extremely simple and predictive gameplay, and a sandbox system of exploration and slaughter.
And what did I find? This. This CRAP.
NPCs tougher than Chuck Norris, a Postal Dude who can't aim at a guy two meters away without missing, a disgusting camera that makes you dizzy and points wherever it wants, a cover system that won't let you aim, bugs, and is disgusting, LINEAR missions, and more crap.

Пожалуй, POSTAL - это одна из самых интересных игр за всю историю компьютерных игр. По сей день вся серия POSTAL для меня является одной из самых любимых игр. Но не для кого из фанатов не секрет, что происходит с данным произведением. Postal 3 вышел в неправильное время. Игра сама по себе не плоха, все та же сатира и ирония человека и общества. Но в чем проблема-то!? Все очень сложно... Разрабы с издателем взяли все и, мягко говоря, испортили. Не было ничего того, что обещали нам в Postal 3, а за то были куча багов и вылетов. Вот игру то и обоср*али. Мы бы попробовали допилить игру все вместе, дружно, что уж там, куда деваться, если любим эту игру! Улучшали, дополняли, изменили бы все в лучшую сторону... И ведь фанаты тоже виноваты отчасти, ежели бы не плевались, а поработали вместе, было бы круто. В принципе есть очень много команд модмейкеров и т.п. которые создают классные моды и выкладывают их на сайты и в мастерскую Postal. Но у каждой команды свои тараканы в голове...
Проходит некоторое время, примерно 4 года, выясняется, что Postal 3 внезапно больше не канон, а просто неофициальный спин-офф. Потом выходит Paradise Lost, дополнение о продолжении путешествий Чувака ( в нем тоже есть минусы, как и в Postal 3, но больше всего отличается ооочень интересным и трешовым, но неправдивым наркоманским сюжетом). Выходит Postal Redux, который сам по себе хорошо сделан, но большой минус в этом Редуксе - это Геймплей, который никак не связан с первым Postal (не соответствует геймплей, так как в первой части он был индивидуальный и сложный, что дополняло игру).
Я не буду вдаваться в подробности, есть много людей (таких же, как я, фанатов POSTAL), которые разложили по полкам все, что можно.
Мне жаль, что произошло с POSTAL. Игра переживает большие падения...","[h1] One of the most interesting games in history...[/h1]

POSTAL is perhaps one of the most interesting games in the history of computer gaming. To this day, the entire POSTAL series remains one of my favorite games. But it's no secret to any of the fans what's happening with this title. Postal 3 came out at the wrong time. The game itself isn't bad, it's still the same satire and irony about humanity and society. But what's the problem!? It's all very complicated... The developers and the publisher took everything and, to put it mildly, ruined it. Postal 3 didn't have anything they promised us, but instead, it was riddled with bugs and crashes. They really trashed the game. We would have tried to finish it together, as a team; what else could we do if we loved this game? They improved, expanded, changed everything for the better... And the fans are partly to blame too; if they hadn't been so spitting and had worked together, it would have been awesome. There are actually a lot of modding teams and the like who create great mods and post them on websites and in the Postal workshop. But each team has their own problems...
Some time passes, about four years, and it turns out that Postal 3 is suddenly no longer canon, but simply an unofficial spin-off. Then comes Paradise Lost, an expansion about the Dude's continued travels (it also has its flaws, like Postal 3, but is most notable for its incredibly interesting and trashy, yet untrue, drug-fueled plot). Postal Redux comes out, which is well-made in its own right, but its biggest drawback is the gameplay, which is completely unrelated to the first Postal (it doesn't match the gameplay in the first game, which was individual and challenging, which complemented the game). I won't go into details; there are many people (like me, POSTAL fans) who have put everything they could on the shelves.

Many people don't seem to understand RWS's update to the game. This game was made by a third party with licenses from RWS to make it. The third party abandoned the dumpster fire of a game shortly after and it was unplayable due to their DRM software. The game was infamous for being unplayable and broken when playable. Years later RWS removed the DRM and applied some quality of life fixes but didn't make it any better of a game. They only did this to make the game playable again, not improve it's gameplay.

W każdym razie teraz do niego wróciłem i oceniam go całkiem dobrze!

Plusy:
- czarny humor
- popieprzony (postalowy) klimacik
- ładna grafika
- wysoki poziom brutalności
- ciekawe lokacje
- spora ilość broni
- system moralności (ścieżka dobra lub zła)
- wygodne rzucanie granatami, kotami, nogami, głowami czy czymś co tam akurat mamy pod ręką xd

Minusy:
- dużo bugów (m.in. ludzie, których mamy eskortować czasami chodzą w kółko, często benzyna nie leje się z kanistra)
- zdarzają się crashe (polecam często zapisywać grę)
- mechanika walki: strzelanie średnie, ale walka wręcz słaba (czasami ciężko wcelować)
- brak otwartego świata (tylko w kampanii, po przejściu gry odblokowuje się tryb freeroam)
- zbugowane niektóre osiągnięcia (BIPOLAR, CHAMP WHISPERER, MEGA-SADIST są zepsute i w żaden uczciwy sposób nie da się ich zdobyć, część pozostałych zalicza się tylko na np. konkretnych mapach)

Postal III moim zdaniem sprawia wrażenie produkcji dobrej, jednak niedopracowanej. Zapewne to skutek działań dewelopera (Trashmasters) oraz wydawcy (Akella). Gdyby Running With Scissors nie zostało przez nich odsunięte i tworzyłoby grę od początku do samego końca to byśmy mieli doczynienia z naprawdę świetną kontynuacją.

Mimo to jednak grę oceniam pozytywnie, ponieważ całkiem przyjemnie mi się pyka. Polecam fanom serii, jednak dla ludzi nie mających wcześniej doczynienia z tą serią odsyłam do legendarnego POSTALa 2!",

There are a lot of bugs, no doubt, such as mapping problems where you'll spawn in from a cutscene and the map doesn't exist anymore, or AI bugging out and getting stuck between props or other AI, and not to mention the often crashing; these are all problems, but you can easily look past them, in my opinion. Take into consideration all the problems this game has is the same problems that are often found in Valve games, speaking of which they both use the Source Engine, which isn't perfect by any means. It's kind of a shame that the levels are very simplistic and unclear to the storyline oftentimes, but it's worth the value of doing it most of the time, as it does lead up to something in the least. The factor of having two different game-styles based on your choice of Good or Bad is a nice touch, and alternate endings based on what you do throughout the game is a fun factor to work towards. Additionally, I will mention that the game is not really lengthy, unlike POSTAL or POSTAL 2, where you can make the game pretty much as long as you'd like. But on a positive side, after you've beaten the story once, you do unlock a free-roam mode, which is much like POSTAL 2, but in Catharsis, not Paradise.

32770566,russian,2017.05.25 16:47,✅,✅,0.5548061132,15,"Правдивый обзор POSTAL lll

Знаете, я удивляюсь откуда за последние  7 лет после выхода POSTAL lll появилось столько дебильных детей в комьюнити которые даже не играя в него, везде срут что это худшая часть серии, и хвалят при этом параш лост и редукс первой части который чуть выше уровня земли. Давайте же все таки разберемся а чем так плох Postal 3?

В те далекие годы когда игра только вышла я на удивление не помню недовольных среди любителей данной серии, и все жалобы были зачастую в сторону технической части игры, которая действительно ужасна в своей сути из-за того что ей просто не хватило полировки хотя бы в полтора года. В игре было очень много проблем, настолько много что большую часть багов никто так и не пофиксил потому что мало кто из комьюнити владеет опытом в работе с написанием кода для source, так что за все время так и не нашлось никого кто бы исправил недочеты не считая пары патчей от моего комрада который методом тыка и копипаста  смог включить неработающий или частично отключенный код, который отключили за пару месяцев до выпуска игры из-за того что он банально был не дописан или работал неправильно или вовсе был старым кодом еще из альфы 2008 года. Но все же там был и вполне полезный код который включал в себя отключенные фразы, загрузочные экраны, и т.д. Так же игра после выхода ужасно лагала из-за того что движок был просто на просто перегружен разным мусором и раз в несколько минут выдавал ошибки как напоминание что трешмастер либо не умеет либо не хочет написать внятный код, ибо в некоторых местах создается впечатление что код писали пленные индийские дети программисты. И на мой взгляд это почти единственный минус данной игры. Так же немного выбешивает что разработчики не смогли нормально приделать музыку, из-за чего она местами прерываеться. Но в целом музыкальная часть в игре очень интересная и не вызывает рвоты после нескольких часов игры. Так же некоторые жалуются что оружие ближнего боя невозможно использовать из-за анимации и маленького урона, но как по мне все эти люди либо не играли в п3 вообще либо не имеют своего мнения в принципе, я как человек который пол игры юзал мачете и лопату могу сказать что в п3 почти абсолютно все оружие юзабельно и полезно, единственное бесполезное оружие это обезьяна моторхед которая вообще не понятно зачем нужна и не делает ничего полезного, да и частенько тупит из-за кривого ии. Конечно есть еще неправильно работающий топор который дает уж слишком мало урона, но думаю и эту проблему можно будет решить патчем повысив урон от удара. (Кстати, попробуйте по  нажимать на вторую кнопку мыши когда будете держать топор в руках, уверяю, такого death run'a вы еще не видели) Видео моего комрада - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNQlPLDOg2I

Так же теперь непонятно почему многие жалуются на сюжет p3, из-за того что он трешевый и вообще не такой как в п2, но ведь каждая часть Postal уникальна? Не так ли? Единственный минус в сюжете как по мне это неадекватный кармометр который попросту работает не правильно и некоторые ненужные миссии или неправильные с точки зрения логики, по типу уровня в полицейской академии который могли бы сделать намного более разнообразным. Но эти минусы по сути опять же из-за слабой технической части игры. На этом серьезные минусы как для меня заканчиваются, ибо дальше в п3 появляется просто уйма интересных миссий и локаций, допустим тот же патруль на мой взгляд очень интересная задумка, и в нем действительно ощущается Postal в своей сути, с черным юмором и сатирой, ну и вполне себе открытым миром. Так что не понимаю тех людей которые говорят что сюжет и квесты в игре хромают.

Так же многие особо умные люди жалуются что в п3 нету открытого мира, но  ведь зачем он вообще в сюжете нужен в игре? Да и сам п3 состоит из больших открытых локаций, которые по своей сути заменяют отрытый мир и делают его совершенно ненужным. Да и для тех кто хотел песочницу в стиле 2й части то прошу пройти в режим свободной прогулки, правда я должен признаться что интеллект по сравнению с 2й часть значительно тупее и более картонные из-за того что большую часть кода связанного с ии просто вырезали... Возможно новый и единственный мод на Catharsis Reborn подарит нам дописанный код для ии который можно будет позже использовать и в обычном п3. 

А где же тут та куча минусов которые описывают школьники с пеной у рта? Разве то что игра отличается от п2 это плохо? Я думаю что нет, ведь это дает ей уникальность по сравнению с оригинальной игрой и Postal 2.

Игра с плохой технической частью и кривыком кодом который все еще лучше чем в Postal Paradise Lost.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1137210474","A Truthful Review of POSTAL III

You know, I'm amazed how, in the last seven years since POSTAL III's release, there have been so many idiots in the community who, without even playing it, are constantly blaming it for being the worst game in the series, while praising Parasite Lost and the first game's redux, which is barely above ground. Let's figure out what's so bad about Postal III.

Back when the game first came out, I surprisingly don't remember any dissatisfied fans of the series, and all the complaints were often about the technical aspects of the game, which are truly terrible because they simply needed at least a year and a half of polish. The game had a lot of problems, so many that most of the bugs were never fixed because few in the community had experience writing source code. So, for the entire time, no one was found to fix the shortcomings, except for a couple of patches from my comrade who, through trial and error, was able to enable non-working or partially disabled code that had been disabled a couple of months before the game's release due to it simply being unfinished, malfunctioning, or even outdated code from the 2008 alpha. However, there was still some useful code there, including disabled phrases, loading screens, etc. Also, the game lagged terribly after release because the engine was simply overloaded with all sorts of junk and threw errors every few minutes as a reminder that the trash master either doesn't know how or doesn't want to write coherent code, because in some places it feels like the code was written by captive Indian child programmers. And in my opinion, this is practically the only downside to this game. It's also a bit annoying that the developers couldn't get the music right, causing it to cut out occasionally. But overall, the music is very interesting and doesn't make you vomit after several hours of play. Some people also complain that melee weapons are unusable due to animation and low damage, but as for me, these people either haven't played P3 at all or don't have an opinion at all. As someone who spent half the game using a machete and a shovel, I can say that almost every weapon in P3 is usable and useful. The only useless weapon is the Motorhead monkey, which has no clear purpose and doesn't do anything useful, and often stalls due to the buggy AI. Of course, there's also the malfunctioning axe, which deals far too little damage, but I think this issue could be addressed with a patch by increasing the damage per hit. (By the way, try pressing the second mouse button while holding an axe; I assure you, you've never seen a death run like this.) My comrade's video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNQlPLDOg2I

It's also unclear now why so many people are complaining about P3's plot, saying it's trashy and completely different from P2. But isn't each Postal game unique? Right? The only drawbacks to the plot, in my opinion, are the inadequate karma meter, which simply doesn't work properly, and some unnecessary or logically flawed missions, like the police academy level, which could have been much more varied. But these drawbacks are essentially due to the game's weak technical aspects. That's where the serious downsides end for me, because P3 continues to feature a ton of interesting missions and locations. For example, the patrol, in my opinion, is a very interesting concept, and it truly feels like Postal at its core, with its dark humor and satire, and a truly open world. So I don't understand those who say the game's plot and quests are lacking.

Also, many particularly smart people complain that P3 doesn't have an open world, but why would the game need one in the story anyway? P3 itself consists of large open locations that essentially replace the open world, making it completely unnecessary. And for those who wanted a sandbox in the style of Part 2, I encourage you to try the free roam mode. Although I must admit, the intelligence compared to Part 2 is significantly dumber and more cardboard-like due to the fact that most of the AI-related code was simply cut out... Perhaps the new and only mod for Catharsis Reborn will give us the completed AI code that can later be used in the regular P3.

And where are all those negatives that schoolchildren are foaming at the mouth? Is the fact that the game is different from P2 a bad thing? I don't think so, because that's what gives it uniqueness compared to the original game and Postal 2.

A game with poor technical features and broken code that is still better than Postal Paradise Lost.

(Quick disclaimer, this review may contain bad spellings and/or bad grammer) 

Pros 

I love the story, it's amazing how Postal dude casually massacures a certain area / building and casually leaves, only concerned about his money. Although the whole game is based on an idea, the fact that he needs gas money for his car so he tries to earn money in order to purchase gas, that could've been thought up by a five year old all the missions are rather create and fun, and include a large amount of death, which us postal players love! The graphics are a big improvement from Postal 2. Another thing I love is the city design, the layouts and levels are way more better designed that postal 2, and all the objects, vechicals people and weapons look very nice. Also, and argueably the most inportant feature, the gore! The gore in Postal 3 is amazing, the whole mutilation and blood is very realistic, and makes the game a whole lot fun as during the carnige, watching all the guts and limbs as well as heads fly around, we just forget we're in a game, forget about all our worldy problems and the fact that we have to go to work soon as the weekend flys by, and just enjoy the moment! Oh and also their is an ingame console, which can easily be activated, that has some cheats to help bad players beat the game or ordinary players to mess around with. Their are a few cheats including godmode, noclip and give all weapons! There are quite a few cool weapons too, including a shotgun, machine gun and a few creative ones like a controllable mad af badger!

Cons. 

The melee is awful. The axe and other weapons barley even actually hit anything, and when they do zero gore any barley any damage happens the first few times, and, from what I've seen during my gameplay, only after your victims drop to the floor, after you beat them with a melee weapon, can you sever their limbs, what is this? Batman? We're just going to knock them out with an axe or a mathete and leave them? No, this is Postal, and in Postal we have to kill everything in sight, which is practically impossible using any meele weapon. The best way to kill npcs and get gore, just as sevred heads or limbs, is too shoot them. Also another bad thing, health! Even with godmode, it's still a challenge to masacure large areas. Wanna know why? Because the Npc's have so much health. It takes atleats four shotgun shells to kill a civilian! I shot an unarmed running civilain, at close range, about 7 times before they finally died. After I played a bunch of missions and decided to mess around I enabled godmode and just stood their, getting shot at, reloading constatnly as I struggle, yes struggle, to kill civilans with my guns. Guns! Seriously??? I hope that their is some unfound cheat to alter the health of ncps or damage from weapons, because it's so hard to go on a massacure witthout realoading due to the fact you just used half a magazine to kill a pathetic civilain..... that negative aspect really ruins the fun and is the most popular reason why I get bored and stop playing for a bit. Seriously, you'd think the civilains had godmode themselfs or somthing...... Also the game is a bit glitchy, with some animations not working and sometimes corpse not dropping to the ground after dying. Also, no steam workshop??? Why??? Now I know video game cheats aren't nessacery, but they're hella fun, but if you're going to add cheats please add more than a few. There's only a few cheats, but luckily their really fun. Although the current weapons are fun, there isn't really many weapons. I would have loved to see more or atleast a steam workshop page with more weapons availabe, but that's not going to happen....

Conclusion 

I think this game is worth a try, but if you plan of killing civilain npcs I wish you goodluck as it's a pain in the arse. There are cheats, which include godmode, noclip and allweapons plus a few more, but not many. The graphics are pretty decent and an inprovement from Postal 2. The story is ok, but how the levels play out is really creative, sometimes challenging and enjoyable. The npcs have a lot of health and the orginal power and easy kills on the weaker unarmed npcs that postal 2 brought apon the player are gone, and now it's actually quite hard to go on a rampage and kill everyone. It's a shame that their isn't a steam workshop page as Postal 2 had one. Their are some cool weapons, but not many. Overall this game is actually ok, but it definaly is disapointing to what I expected. I don't think £9.99 is acceptable for this game, I'd pay about £4 for it.....

А ведь в 2008 году в Игромании писали что готово 80% игры, прилогались скриншоты от первого лица. Эх найти бы ту бетту и поиграть в неё. А эту версию игры начали воять примерно с октября 2008. Об этом даже где-то писали. Именно по этой причине игра на стадии выхода оказалась глюкавым куском дерьмеца. Короче, зря нашим дали переделывать Postal 3.

This version of the game was already being thrashed around October 2008. It was even mentioned somewhere. For this very reason, the game turned out to be a glitchy piece of crap at launch. In short, it was a shame they let our guys remake Postal 3. I have nothing against Akella itself, but I do have a problem with their TrashMasters division...

Still can't recommend it though, it feels more like a postal themed half-life 2 mod than a worthy sequel.","Bought it for a few bucks, thought I'd check for myself what all the hatered is for.

Postal 3 tiene come il predecessore violenza gratuita e anche tante situazioni demenziali.
Il problema principale del gioco è il fatto di essere rotto. Tiene tantissimi problemi, così tanti da sembrarlo come quelli mal fatti dello ""Steam Greenlight"".


Non è per cattiveria, la trama segue esattamente come finisce il dlc ""Apocalypse Weekend"" del postal dude, andrà in nuove città a fare lavori di tutti i generi, fine.
La narrativa non è mai stato una priorità per la serie, era sempre povera quindi in questo caso ci stà, il problema è tutto il resto.

Il gameplay è in terza persona, e già qua potrebbe far storcere il naso a parecchi fan della saga, ma alla fine riusciamo ad abituarci.
Non dovremo più fare semplici commissioni come facevano il capitolo precedente, ma per ogni livello avremo un lavoro diverso, alcuni normali e altri bizzarri.
Un grosso punto a sfavore del gioco è il fatto che non sia più free roaming. I livelli sono abbastanza piccoli, e le missioni che dovremmo fare tengono tanta ripetitività come raccogliere oggetti con ""l'aspirapolvere"" o proteggere delle persone.
L'arsenale è ben vasto e ci sono delle armi originali che mi hanno fatto divertire, come la motosega-tasso. Avremo a disposizione nuovamente il gatto che oltre a usarlo come silenziatore sul fucile d'assalto lo potremmo lanciare addosso ai nemici.... avrà lo stesso effetto del DLC ""Weekend Apocalypse"". Ruoteranno su loro stessi alla taz-mania danneggiando parecchio il nemico.

Nel quarto livello bisogna decidere una fazione, se stare dalla parte buona o quella cattiva. Dalla decisione che prenderemo ci verranno proposte missioni completamente diverse.
Fin qua sembrerebbe un bel gioco anche, ma adesso arriviamo alle parti negative le elenco:

LA IA DEL GIOCO E INESISTENTE!
Ok anche quella di postal 2 non era il massimo, ma alla fine faceva il suo lavoro. Qua perché dico che è inesistente?
Vedo persone che sparano AI MURI, TANTE PERSONE. Persone che ti dovrebbero sparare e se ne stanno fermi senza far nulla, e persone che non reagiscono (qua un 50%) neanche se gli pisci addosso...

MUSICA
La musica di questo gioco ha principalmente 3 lati negativi:
-la prima è il tipo di musica non azzeccata bene, anche banale con pochi strumenti musicali, solo quella della missione ""gay"" l'ho trovata abbinata.
-la seconda è il volume della musica, che è nettamente più alto ai rumori e voci del gioco. Molte volte non riuscivo a capire cosa diceva il Postal Dude
-la terza è fatto in un loop orrendo, la musica finisce con tanto di effetto dissolvenza... e poi riprende come niente fosse (sarà orribile da sentire, sopratutto nelle canzoni ""cantate"").

OTTIMIZZATO MALE
Ci sono molte sezioni nel gioco dove andrà a scatti pure sotto i 30 frame quando.

MISSIONI RIPETITIVE FINO ALL'ESTREMO
Come avevo accennato pure prima, le missioni sono veramente troppo simili fra di loro. Anche Postal 2 lo era per carità, ma riusciva a coglierti di sorpresa dagli eventi che ti capitavano quando facevi delle commissioni normali.
Senza parlare della fazione ""buona"", tiene lo stesso problema della ripetitività ma è  ""Fuori luogo"" visto che sarai letalmente un poliziotto.
Cavolo il postal dude un poliziotto... per carità ha i suoi momenti comici però non è così divertente come la fazione opposta.
La longevità invece è sulla norma... sulle 4 ore e mezza/5, fidatevi che son più che sufficienti.

PRO
-Humor seppur non divertente come il predecessore, riuscirà a strapparvi qualche sorriso
-Arsenale di armi ben ricco e contiene altre armi originali
-Due fazioni di gioco da scegliere ti dà la possibilità di rigiocare il gioco

CONTRO
-Esplorazione nei livelli singoli quasi nulla
-Missioni troppo ripetitive
-Difficoltà facile (non sarà possibile selezionare il livello di difficoltà)
-La musica non è niente di chè, ogni tanto non c'entra con gli eventi che stanno succedendo, e in più tiene un volume troppo alto non facendo sentire i dialoghi
-Ottimizzatto molto male con cali di frame rate abbastanza gravi
-Ci sono tantissimi suoni che mancano tipo quando ricarichi le armi o quando prendi a pugni qualcuno
-I pugni sembrano che non facciano danno
-Modelli dei personaggi che non funzionano a dovere (spesso si muovevano senza l'animazione dei passi).
-Grafica datata
-La fazione buona l'ho trovata ""fuori luogo"" (per via delle missioni poliziesche, parere personale).

Voto: 4.5/10","What a disaster this game is...
Postal 3 lives up to its predecessor's gratuitous violence and even a lot of silly situations.
The game's main problem is that it's broken. It has so many problems, so many that it feels like the poorly made ""Steam Greenlight"" ones.

This isn't meant to be mean; the plot follows exactly how Postal Dude's ""Apocalypse Weekend"" DLC ends: he goes to new cities to do all sorts of jobs, and that's it.
Narrative has never been a priority for the series; it was always poor, so in this case it's fine; the problem is everything else.

The gameplay is in third-person, and that might already turn off many fans of the series, but we eventually get used to it.
We'll no longer have to run simple errands like the previous game, but for each level we'll have a different job, some normal and some bizarre.
A major downside to the game is the fact that it's no longer free-roaming. The levels are quite small, and the missions we have to complete are quite repetitive, like collecting objects with the vacuum cleaner or protecting people.
The arsenal is vast, and there are some original weapons that I enjoyed, like the badger chainsaw. We'll once again have the cat, which, in addition to being used as a silencer on the assault rifle, we can throw it at enemies... it will have the same effect as the ""Weekend Apocalypse"" DLC. They'll spin around like a taz-maniac, damaging the enemy quite a bit.

In the fourth level, you have to decide on a side, whether to be on the good side or the bad side. Depending on your decision, completely different missions will be offered.
So far, it seems like a good game, but now let's get to the negatives. I'll list them:

THE GAME'S AI IS NON-EXISTENT!
Okay, even the one in Postal 2 wasn't the best, but in the end, it did its job. Why do I say it's non-existent?
I see people shooting at walls, LOTS of them. People who should be shooting you and just stand there doing nothing, and people who don't react (50% of them here) even if you piss on them...

MUSIC
This game's music has three main downsides:
- the first is the kind of music that's not well-chosen, even banal with few musical instruments; only the one in the ""gay"" mission matched it.
- the second is the volume of the music, which is significantly louder than the in-game noises and voices. Many times I couldn't understand what the Postal Dude was saying.
- the third is that it's on a horrible loop; the music ends with a fade-out effect... and then resumes as if nothing had happened (it's horrible to listen to, especially in the ""sung"" songs).

POORLY OPTIMIZED
There are many sections in the game where it will stutter even under 30 frames per second.

EXTREMELY REPETITIVE MISSIONS
As I mentioned before, the missions are truly too similar to each other. Postal 2 was similar, for goodness sake, but it managed to catch you off guard with the events that happened when you were doing normal errands.
Not to mention the ""good"" faction, which suffers from the same repetitiveness problem, but it's ""out of place"" considering you're a lethal cop.
Damn, Postal Dude, a cop... he has his comical moments, but he's not as funny as the opposing faction.
The length, on the other hand, is average... about 4.5 to 5 hours, trust me, that's more than enough.

PROS
- Humor, while not as funny as its predecessor, will still make you smile.
- Extensive arsenal of weapons, including other original weapons.
- Two factions to choose from gives you the opportunity to replay the game.

CONS
- Almost no exploration in individual levels.
- Missions are too repetitive.
- Easy difficulty (you can't select the difficulty level).
- The music isn't anything special; sometimes it doesn't fit with the events, and it's too loud, making it hard to hear the dialogue.
- Very poorly optimized, with some pretty severe frame rate drops.
- There are tons of sounds missing, like when you reload weapons or when you punch someone.
- Punches feel like they don't do any damage.
- Character models don't work properly (they often moved without footstep animations).
- Dated graphics.
- I found the good faction ""out of place"" (due to the police missions, personal opinion).

Rating: 4.5/10"
30844540,english,2017.02.31 05:35,✅,❌,0.6187152863,24,"This game isn't as bad as people say it is. Sure, it can be buggy, and the framerate dips quite a bit, but it isn't too bad.
I think most people's problem with it is it's departure from Postal 2. If you're looking for a Postal 2-like experience, don't get this, get Postal 2 Paradise Lost. It's cheaper and honestly a much better product.
This game isn't like Postal 2, it's a third person action shooter with a Postal 2 theme to it.
So, pros and cons:

Pros:
- Lots of new weapons and items - such as beehives to throw at enemys
- Lost of references to Postal 2 - Lots of items/weapons return, recap of what happened in the last game, and quite a few returning characters
- Champ... Champ is awesome
- The game looks very nice. Seriously, the graphics are amazing
- You can dash - a feature that I wish was in Postal 2
- It's amazingly fun to completely trample people by dashing at them
- Branching story with different missions for each branch
- The art is quite nice

Cons:
- The controls are fucking wonky at times. Sometimes your accuracy is really off, and everything is either above or below the crosshair. Also, you can't jump anymore. You can only vault over certain objects while you're taking cover behind them
- The framerate dips a lot
- The game crashes occasionally
- Quite a few odd glitches
- The saving system is pretty garbage. Unlike Postal 2 where it was clean and organized, this saving system has your save data all over the place
- No difficulty settings. Postal 2 had so many difficulty settings to choose from, so why can't this?
- Rick Hunter (The Postal Dude's voice actor) isn't here for this game. Instead, they have Cory Cruise substituting for him. Cory does an alright job, but it isn't as good as Rick, in my opinion
- The inventory is a cluttered mess. In Postal 2, everything was organized into catagories

Pros or Cons? - These I'll leave up to you to decide:
- The game is in third person now
- The game is much more linear. Postal 2 put you in an open world with some objectives to complete around the map, while Postal III is linear and mission based.
- The soundtrack is pretty good, but often times very oddly unfitting
- The distastful humor from Postal 2 is back, and ramped up to be worse than before

I haven't played the game too much yet, but honestly I feel like I've gotten the full experience from just my first 2 hours of gameplay.
So far I've enjoyed the game, but I'll let you weight the pros and cons and make a decisions for yourself.
Also, rather than paying for it and giving Akella more money that they don't deserve, just email Mike J of RWS asking for a key. He's often pretty generous with them.","This game isn't as bad as people say it is. Sure, it can be buggy, and the framerate dips quite a bit, but it isn't too bad.

While slightly better marksmanship can make you unstoppable with your pistol and M16, the screen flickering when enemy firepower is strong is frustrating, and there's also the mysterious range of the enemies.

Being burned is almost certain death, but you can still crouch for a while to recover, huh? Running is a death sentence. NPCs can only be burned, and exploding the fire extinguisher on the wall won't put out the fire.

Why do I have to replay two levels if I rejoin the cops midway? What the hell?

Why did they remove the swearing and threats?

There are so few weapon options.

The sandbox doesn't feel like a sandbox, and the linearity doesn't feel like a linearity...

We have to mention the various lags and crashes. Initially, some users on 8.1 couldn't enter the game, and throwing items would cause the game to crash, whether it was because they were unplugged or offline. Of course, it would crash for no apparent reason. (Here's a patch, I downloaded it via a VPN: http://pan.baidu.com/s/1qYPKmr6 Password: 36kx)
Of course, the biggest complaint is that it uses the Source engine for third-person perspective, and it's so poorly done. I imagine a GMO player could easily surpass this game by making their own Postal 3.

*The Humor - Guys, making The Postal Dude say ""I blame (irrelevant subject here)!"" nearly every time he kills something is NOT funny. Rehashing lines from Postal 2 isn't cute.

*No map, arrows, or anything that indicated where to go next.
*Annoyingly long loading times.
*Poor optimization.
*Crashes frequently.
*Stutters every time a new mission starts.
*A.I. can be incredibly stupid, especially when you're supposed to protect someone.
*LOUD, imbalanced sound.
*No Open-world exploration between missions - Seriously? This is what made Postal 2 so much fun.

*Good/Evil karma system, Multiple Endings - interesting idea. good for replayability. Too bad I achieved one of the endings in about 5 hours, most of which were spent wondering where the hell I was supposed to go.

Did I enjoy myself during this game? A little. Did I laugh? Yes.
Are Postal 2, and Postal 2: Paradise Lost, and Postal 4 superior to this game in every conceivable way?

Yes. Yes they are.","Overall, the game just feels... deceitful. Fake. Disingenuous. It's the video game equivalent of watching a child getting hit by a car.

Pros:
*The Soundtrack - surprisingly good. Clearly much more effort went into it than everything else.

Aaaand that's about it.

Netural:
*Third person perspective - I personally don't mind it, but it would've been nice to have had the option of having a first person perspective, too.
*Corey Cruise as Postal Dude - disappointing to not have Rick Hunter's amazing voice soothing my ears, but Cruise still does a commendable job.

Ben effectivement, c'est une sacrée daube, on revient sur le principe du premier Postal avec du nettoyage d’Arène(19 presque toute en couloir) mais cette fois, avec une vu à la troisième personne. Dans le premier Postal, ça fonctionne parce qu'on a une vu d'ensemble(du dessus).

Ce jeu tourne avec le moteur Source(half life 2) et ça ressemble vraiment a un mod amateur. Je me suis éclater sur Postal, Postal redux, Postal 2(un incontournable) et son DLC. Ce troisième opus, j'ai vraiment essayer de l'aimer... Mais j'y arrive pas.

Le plus énervant, je crois que c'est les bug, le jeu rame dans certaine Arène même sur un pc de gamer. Les succes ne fonctionne pas ou s'unlock tout seul sans raison. Et si le jeu crash, ben t'a plus qu'a reboot ton PC.

Enfin bref, a tester uniquement pour la passion des jeux rater ;)","The cursed Postal, disowned by the publisher itself... I wanted to make up my own mind.

Well, indeed, it's a real mess. It's a return to the principle of the first Postal, with Arena clearing (19 almost entirely in corridors), but this time, with a third-person view. In the first Postal, it works because we have a bird's eye view (from above).

This game runs on the Source engine (Half-Life 2) and it really feels like an amateur mod. I had a blast with Postal, Postal Redux, Postal 2 (a must-have), and its DLC. I really tried to like this third installment... But I can't.

The most annoying thing, I think, is the bugs. The game lags in certain Arenas, even on a gaming PC. Achievements don't work or unlock themselves for no reason. And if the game crashes, well, you just have to reboot your PC.

Jugué al Postal 2 y me encantó. Al enterarme de que iba a salir el 3 e imaginándome las mil maneras que iba a tener a mi disposición para acabar con terroristas e inocentes por igual me emocioné. Qué equivocado estaba.

La tercera entrega liquida a la saga mediante el sistema más lineal que he visto nunca. Ahora es cuando alguien dice: ""Pero te deja jugar sin matar, matando a todos o a algunos y eso te lleva a distintas situaciones"". Aclaro. Postal 2 era un gran juego en el cual no matabas porque el juego así lo quería, Portal 2 te tentaba a cometer verdaderas atrocidades porque el jugador lo quería o porque así era más fácil el juego.
No voy a soltar mierdas de ""dilemas sociales"" o ""la verdadera naturaleza del ser humano"", pero así es.
Este Postal 3 te lleva de la mano TODO el rato, si hasta tiene tutorial. La historia es un intento MUY fallido de resultar gracioso, mientras que anteriores entregas lo eran sin intentarlo tanto. La jugabilidad también es malísima, siendo el primer juego en vista isométrica, el segundo en primera persona y este en tercera con ""cámara sobre el hombro"". Es confuso, no matar a nadie es casi imposible y mantenerte de un bando en una misión donde se enfrentan dos grupos requiere de una precisión divina, debido a lo fácil que es que un componente de tu bando sea herido por tus intentos de acertar a algo.
No lo recomiendo para nada.
Compra el Postal 2 y déjate de terceras partes","I know this is what everyone says, but here I go.
I played Postal 2 and loved it. When I found out the 3rd was coming out, imagining the thousand ways I'd have at my disposal to take out terrorists and innocents alike, I was thrilled. How wrong I was.

The third installment ends the series with the most linear system I've ever seen. Now is when someone says, ""But it lets you play without killing, killing everyone or some, and that leads to different situations."" Let me clarify. Postal 2 was a great game in which you didn't kill because the game wanted it that way; Portal 2 tempted you to commit true atrocities because the player wanted it or because it made the game easier.
I'm not going to spout bullshit about ""social dilemmas"" or ""the true nature of human beings,"" but that's how it is.
This Postal 3 holds your hand the ENTIRELY, and it even has a tutorial. The story is a VERY failed attempt at being funny, while previous installments were funny without really trying. The gameplay is also terrible, with the first game in isometric view, the second in first-person, and this one in third-person with an ""over-the-shoulder camera."" It's confusing, not killing anyone is nearly impossible, and staying on one side in a mission where two groups are facing off requires divine precision, due to how easy it is for a member of your side to be injured by your attempts to hit something.
I don't recommend it at all.
Buy Postal 2 and forget about third-party games."

Postal III is a third-person shooter in which you… ehh… uhm…

Alright I’m going to level with you – don’t buy Postal III. Seriously, you’d regret it. Hell, you’d regret playing it for free. It’s a borderline-broken, boring, frustrating, unfinished mess, and there was nothing we could do stop it.

What happened is that we agreed to let a big Russian publisher develop and publish a third Postal game, which we would handle the design for. It was actually going well for the initial development time, but then the economy crashed especially hard in Russia and the project was handed to a smaller, less experienced team that didn’t have the skill or resources to make the game we designed, and they were forced to rush development to meet unreasonable deadlines. Corners were cut severely, dramatic changes to our design were made, and the game was put out in an unfinished barely-Alpha state. The game is simply unfinished and broken. And when it does work, the game is just boring and frustrating to play. The sad part is that the publisher made little-to-no effot to fix it themselves, nor did they ever give us access so that we could try patching it up for them. We are stuck with Postal III as it is.

You’re a responsible adult (we hope), so I’m sure you’re capable of making your own purchasing decisions.

Chego em casa e vejo que o jogo tem uma atualização e depois de alguns segundos processando eu fico abismado com a informação. Eu pensei que o jogo tinha sido removido da Steam (e tinha) e tão grande a minha surpresa ao ver que simplesmente remover o DRM desse jogo resolveria 90% dos problemas técnicos nele apresentados. Porra, eu joguei 1 hora inteirinha sem crashar, até ontem esse jogo só era comparativo para eu diminuir outros jogos igualmente ruins aqui na plataforma, quanto a isso tenho que parabenizar a RWS.

Mas...vamos lá. O jogo não crashar faz com que esse jogo deixe de ser um teste de paciência e só se torne um sonífero na mais pura definição da palavra. Pra quem nunca jogou esse jogo ele tem um sistema muito idiotinha de karma e com base nas decisões do player ele pode se manter num pathing bom (que leva a um final bom) ou cair no pathing ruim e ter o final ruim...é, bem preto e branco. Com essa experiencia nova eu pensei em ir pro pathing bom já que a última vez que me coloquei nessa tortura anos atrás fui atrás de só atirar em tudo que se movia por que sei lá...é Postal?

Jogar esse jogo com o intuito de pegar o final verdadeiro é a verdadeira tortura, os objetivos são MUITO chatos e quando eu vi o Dude uniformizado como policial eu me perguntei como isso se quer seria possível, trechos de tiro intenso ainda existem mas existem momentos onde você vai se limitar a usar um Tazer ou alguma forma não letal de lidar com a situação e isso poderia até funcionar em games como Postal 2 mas aqui é só muito repetitivo.

Algo legal dessa dinâmica é que os dois pathings são bem diferentes até mesmo mudando fases por completo, é possível zerar esse jogo sem saber que o Uwe Boll estava nele (o diretor do filme de Postal) ou sem saber que o Dude já foi presidente mesmo que por 20 segundos, mas honestamente, o quanto você realmente se esforçaria por um game desses? A história já não é canon então nem por entendimento da franquia isso aqui importa.

Quanto a gameplay, é asquerosa. A movimentação do Dude é BIZARRA ele corre tão rápido que derruba praticamente qualquer coisa que atropelar e tem uma stamina invisivel que pode te deixar na mão na hora errada. A mira é imprecisa e com algumas armas (especialmente o aspirador que você vai usar em uma única missão mas vai carregar durante o jogo todo por motivo de desenvolvedor russo) faz com que você só mire no peito pra acertar a cabeça, é estranho. O free roam pelas fases é bloqueado até você zerar o jogo mas quantas pessoas realmente fizeram isso? e honestamente...sei lá.

Para aqueles buscando platina a melhor noticia é que as conquistas que eram impossíveis (sim, isso aconteceu, existiam conquistas que poderiam ser exploitadas mas algumas eram impossíveis sem uso de meios externos) foram removidas. Mas a gameplay é tão tediosa que só consigo desejar boa sorte para aqueles que quiserem pegar todas as pngs de matar x inimigos com arma y nessa bomba de jogo.

Vale uma ressalva pra dublagem do Dude e pra trilha do jogo que são as únicas coisas boa nesse jogo, o Corey Cruise manda muito bem e eu fiquei muito feliz que ele voltou no quarto jogo por que eu gosto tanto da interpretação dele do personagem quanto gosto da do Rick Hunter. Quanto a trilha, até hoje algumas músicas do A Fall To Break estão na minha playlist pra me cortar no banho, menção honrosa pra Lost, Left, All Alone que compõem os créditos do jogo e de vez em tempos eu volto a ouvir. 
 
Por fim, gostaria de mencionar a conquista de matar 300 terroristas que até então era bugada e a forma de conseguir seria matar o boss rinoceronte 300x e isso fez muito marmanjo criar um save antes do boss morrer e perder 1 horinha em loading brincando. Eu não sei se isso foi concertado mas espero que não por que mais Postal que isso é impossível. 

Em resumo, Postal³ não é mais o pior jogo que ja joguei, mas eu provavelmente cairia no sono se me forçasse a jogar nem que fosse mais um pouco. De forma alguma isso aqui vale 2 reais que seja quem dirá 20 mas se você por algum motivo já tem o jogo e dropou depois de ter que recomeçar uma fase por que ousou jogar uma granada e o jogo crashou talvez vale uma risada ou sei lá o que levaria alguém a baixar isso de novo, eu só abri por que por acaso eu esqueci de desinstalar ele quando estava caçando as conquistas dos demais jogos da franquia.  Caso contrario, passar longe, não espere nada mais vindo desse titulo até por que acho que a RWS só tem controle parcial sobre esse jogo (já que foi desenvolvido pela AKELLA), e além de que eles já deserdaram esse filho de qualquer forma e a história segue sem ele nos próximos títulos. Tem alguns mods muito legais que você encontra fácil na comunidade STEAM que talvez também vale dar uma olhada, mas quanto ao jogo base em uma instalação limpa isso aqui ainda fede e muito.
","I never thought I'd bother seriously reviewing this game, because playing it from start to finish was a test of patience that wasn't worth it, even for die-hard fans of the franchise.

I get home and see that the game has an update, and after a few seconds of processing it, I'm stunned by the information. I thought the game had been removed from Steam (which it had), and I was so surprised to see that simply removing the DRM from this game would solve 90% of its technical issues. Hell, I played for a whole hour without a crash. Until yesterday, this game was only used as a comparison to dismiss other equally bad games on the platform. I have to congratulate RWS on that.

But...let's go. The game not crashing makes this game less of a test of patience and more of a soporific in the purest sense of the word. For those who've never played this game, it has a pretty silly karma system. Based on the player's decisions, they can either stay on a good path (which leads to a good ending) or fall into a bad path and get the bad ending... yeah, pretty black and white. With this new experience, I thought about going for the good path, since the last time I put myself through this torture years ago, I was just trying to shoot everything that moved because, I don't know... is it Postal?

Playing this game with the goal of getting the true ending is pure torture. The objectives are SO boring, and when I saw the Dude in a police uniform, I wondered how that was even possible. There are still intense shooting sections, but there are moments where you'll be limited to using a Tazer or some other non-lethal way to deal with the situation. This could even work in games like Postal 2, but here it's just very repetitive.

One cool thing about this dynamic is that the two paths are quite different, even when completely changing stages. It's possible to beat this game without knowing Uwe Boll was in it (the director of the Postal movie) or that the Dude was once president, even for 20 seconds. But honestly, how much effort would you really put into a game like this? The story isn't canon, so it doesn't even matter from a franchise perspective.

As for the gameplay, it's disgusting. The Dude's movement is BIZARRE; he runs so fast that he knocks over practically anything he runs over, and he has invisible stamina that can let you down at the wrong time. The aim is imprecise, and with some weapons (especially the vacuum cleaner, which you'll use in a single mission but will carry throughout the game due to the Russian developer) you only aim for the chest to hit the head. It's weird. Free roam through the stages is blocked until you beat the game, but how many people actually did that? And honestly... I don't know.

For those aiming for platinum, the best news is that the achievements that were impossible (yes, that happened; there were exploitable achievements, but some were impossible without external means) have been removed. But the gameplay is so tedious that I can only wish good luck to those who want to get all the PNGs for killing x enemies with y weapon in this bomb of a game.

It's worth mentioning the Dude's voice acting and the soundtrack, which are the only good things about this game. Corey Cruise is great, and I was very happy he returned in the fourth game because I like his interpretation of the character as much as I like Rick Hunter's. As for the soundtrack, to this day, some songs from A Fall To Break are on my playlist to keep me busy in the shower. Honorable mention goes to Lost, Left, and All Alone, which make up the game's credits and I listen to them every now and then.

Finally, I'd like to mention the achievement for killing 300 terrorists, which until then was bugged. The way to get it was to kill the rhino boss 300 times. This caused many adults to create a save before the boss died and waste an hour loading time playing around. I don't know if this has been fixed, but I hope not, because Postal³ is impossible to beat.

In short, Postal³ isn't the worst game I've ever played, but I'd probably fall asleep if I forced myself to play even a little longer. This isn't worth 2 reais, let alone 20 reais, but if you already have the game and dropped it after having to restart a level because you dared to throw a grenade and the game crashed, it might be worth a laugh or whatever would make someone download it again. I only opened it because I accidentally forgot to uninstall it when I was hunting for achievements for the other games in the franchise. Otherwise, stay away, don't expect anything more from this title, especially since I think RWS only has partial control over this game (since it was developed by AKELLA), and besides, they've already disowned this son anyway and the story continues without him in the next titles. There are some really cool mods that you can easily find in the STEAM community that might also be worth checking out, but as for the base game on a clean install, this still really stinks."

25559833,japanese,2016.08.18 05:42,❌,✅,0.5266272426,4,"不謹慎（？）お使いゲーム「Postal２」の続編という肩書きだが、何故か開発はRWS社とは別のデベロッパーによる開発。

主人公「ポスタル・デュード」が奇想天外（？）なお使いをこなしていくというTPSゲームで分岐ありの全16ミッション。（善ルートの場合。）

とりあえず善ルートを通しで一通りクリアしてみたのだが、妙に笑えるキャラが取り巻くストーリー展開は個人的に面白かった。

しかし、それ以上にマイナス点が多く、、

１、フリーズや強制終了がとにかく多く、かなりストレスが溜まる作り。

２、ある程度自由に行動できるうえ、行動できるマップも結構広い「２」と比べると自由度がほとんど無く、ミッションごとに行動できるマップも広くないお使いミッション。
（一応、善ルートにはパトロールの仕事と称し、「２」のような順不同のお使いミッションが2箇所あるのだが、マップがやや狭いうえ、指定の場所に行くと勝手にイベント進行＞ミッション開始という流れなので余り自由度が感じられない。）

３、爆発等のエフェクトが前作よりもやや劣るうえ、マシンガンなどの一部の効果音がかなりうるさい。
（キャラのモデリングとかは良いんだけどね、、)

特に強制終了とフリーズは大勢の敵味方が入り乱れてドンパチする局面でかなりの確立で発生し、正直な話。「本当にデバックしたのか？」勘ぐってしまうほどひどい。
（善ルートでは（私のプレイでは）特に9面、12面、15面、16面で多発。私の場合、こまめなセーブでこの修羅場を乗り切ったが、、）

特に初めてラスボスを破壊した瞬間に強制終了したときは正直「はぁ？」と言いたくなった、、

あと、分岐があるとはいえ、「2」よりもボリューム感が感じられず、正直「これで終わり？｣という感が強かった。
（ちなみにこれでも「２」（新版は約７GB（DLC込み））よりはるかに多い13.5GB（ダウンロード時11GB強）である。どこで容量食ってんだか、、）

はっきりいって、この内容では正式な続編というより「ポスタルファンが作った２次創作作品」としか思えない残念作品だった。

正直な話、「２」が面白かったので興味があるとしても話のネタなどといった特別な理由でもない限り、気軽に手を出すのはあまりお勧めしない。
（まぁ、強制終了の嵐に耐えられるのであれば止めはしないが、、〉","Although it's billed as a sequel to the inappropriate (?) errand game ""Postal 2,"" for some reason it was developed by a different developer than RWS.

This TPS game sees the protagonist, ""Postal Dude,"" complete outlandish (?) errands, with a total of 16 branching missions (assuming you're on the good route).

I initially completed the good route, and personally found the storyline surrounding the oddly hilarious characters entertaining.

However, there were many more negative aspects...

1. The game freezes and crashes frequently, making it extremely stressful.

2. Compared to ""2,"" which allowed for a certain degree of freedom of movement but also a fairly large map, there's very little freedom in the errand missions, and the maps available for each mission aren't very large.
(The Good Route does have two random errand missions called ""patrol jobs,"" similar to ""2."" However, the map is a bit small, and simply going to a designated location automatically triggers an event and then the mission begins, so it doesn't feel like there's much freedom.)

3. The effects for explosions and other things are a bit inferior to the previous game, and some of the sound effects, like machine guns, are quite loud.

(The character modeling is good, though...)

Crashes and freezes are particularly common during scenes where a large number of enemies and allies are fighting, and to be honest, it's so bad that it makes you wonder if they really did debug it.
(On the good route, this happened frequently (in my playthrough), especially on levels 9, 12, 15, and 16. I managed to get through these crapshoots by saving frequently, though...)

Especially when the game crashed the moment I defeated the final boss for the first time, I honestly wanted to say, ""Huh?""

Also, even though there are branching paths, it felt less substantial than ""2,"" and honestly, I had a strong feeling of, ""Is this the end?""

By the way, this is still 13.5GB (just over 11GB when downloaded), far more than ""2"" (the new version is about 7GB, including DLC). I wonder where that space is going...)

Frankly, with this content, it's a disappointing work that feels more like a ""secondary work made by Postal fans"" than an official sequel.

To be honest, even if you enjoyed ""2,"" I wouldn't recommend picking it up casually unless you have a special reason, like a story topic, unless you have a specific reason.
(Well, if you can endure the constant crashes, I wouldn't stop you...)"

Postal 3
A wonderful example of what happens when you trust the game of left-wing uncles and aunts from Akella.I can't understand why RWS did not do the game themselves,and in fact sent her to the slaughter.
Cons
The third person - I think that first-person postal 3 would look much better,but no,Akella decided.You stupidly can't get a fist in the fucking face.
Voice - not that she odnogolosy,during a conversation even begins some kakafoniya:Hiss,crackles,distortion,white noise,short on the ears gives a very good.

Crappy weapons - don't Even try to use something other than firearms.While you aim with the pointer in the hope that Champ will bite the enemy eggs,you will cut into the salad.
Stupid AI - That you ran over the enemy,I think he will shoot at you ? No,it is stupid and will rise to behold the walls in this game.
Pros
Music - the Music is surprisingly good(Except for that lullaby on the bridge at the beginning of the game).

The Good
- Short length. Normally I'd have a problem with a game being incredibly short, but not this one. The gameplay is pretty much boring garbage all the way through, so the fact that it's over quickly is a nice unintended blessing.
- Cool voice acting. Most of the dialogue is just shitty attempts at jokes which aren't funny at all, but the voice actors do a good job with that they're given. The Dudes voice actor also does a great job at making things at least slightly tolerable.
- Nice (but worthless) weapon variety. There are a lot of weapons on offer here and they have some decent looking models and sounds for the most part, it's just that most of them range from bad to useless, and don't really get any better from there (see below for more).

The Bad
- Broken weapon balancing. Lots of firearms like the Pistol and Shotgun are incredibly weak, and melee is very low damage as well. Through pretty much the entire game only one gun is worth using, the M16. The M16 is an automatic weapon with high damage, low recoil and fast reloads, and so many enemies use it that it's almost impossible to run out of ammo for, making it the default weapon for pretty much the entire game.
- Map design is terrible. The maps in Postal III have very little in them and hidden items are almost non existant. Exploration is also totally gone, because the game is completely linear, instead of being able to go from map to map as you please, you're locked to single maps at a time and constantly forced into new missions.
- Unfunny humour. Like I said with my POSTAL 2 review, humour is subjective, so whether or not I find something funny won't really change whether others find it funny or not, but it seems that most people who've played it think that the attempts at jokes in Postal III were garbage, and I completely agree.
- No exploration. As I mentioned above, the game has no exploration besides the little exploring you can do in the maps you're locked inside, which generally don't include anything to find other than the occasional ammo pickup here and there. There is an unlockable free roam mode available after you finish the campaign, but there's nothing to do inside the free roam world other than pick up weapons and kill civilians, which doesn't feel fun or satisfying at all.
- No health items. Yes, that's right, Postal III completely removes health items and replaces them with a regenerating health mechanic which makes the only way to get health back sitting behind a wall and waiting.
- No difficulty options. Yeah, they removed those as well. POSTAL 2 had dozens of different difficulty options, Postal III has just one. This means that the game is always locked to one mode, easy as shit. The game has no real challenging moments at all, and I managed to complete the game without dying once with very little effort.
- Karma system. While POSTAL 2 let you play your way, it never punished you for choosing a certain style, Postal III does this a lot. The Karma system splits the game into 2 different paths, the Good Path and the Insane Path. On the Good Path you have to keep your Karma meter from dropping to bad, otherwise you get forced onto the Insane Path. On the Insane Path if you manage to fill your Karma meter up to good, you get the option to move on to the Good Path. The Karma bar is affected by how you deal with NPCs, if you kill unarmed people (and sometimes even armed attackers if the game just feels like being an unreasonable dick, which it does on certain missions) your karma will go down, leaving innocents alone and using non lethal weapons on enemies will bring the bar up again. This means that you are punished for being violent in Postal, a series which has always been about violence, this just ruins any potential fun the combat could've had, especially because the Insane Path is worse than the Good Path just by being more frustrating and tedious.

Overall, Postal III is a clearly unfinished and poorly thought out mess, clips of the game from 2007 up to its release in 2011 show that it changed a lot throughout development and its clear that the teams that worked on it just ran out of money and got desperate, hoping that booting the game out the door before it was properly finished would save them by making some small profits on release to recover the dev costs. It didn't, and Akella and Trashmasters are now dead as a result, Postal III clearly explains why, it's a broken, buggy and tedious mess that nobody should bother trying, even for a joke, it's just not worth wasting time on, it isn't even canon in the POSTAL universe anymore thanks to POSTAL 2 Paradise Lost retconning it, so you have no reason to bother with it, save your money and your time.","DISCLAIMER: Most of the hundreds of hours I have on this game are actually from a Total Conversion mod for it called Catharsis Reborn, I've only done about 4 playthroughs of vanilla Postal 3 over the years, so I've really only played it for around 8-10 hours.

- Cool voice acting. Most of the dialogue is just shitty attempts at jokes which aren't funny at all, but the voice actors do a good job with that they're given. The Dudes voice actor also does a great job at making things at least slightly tolerable.
- Nice (but worthless) weapon variety. There are a lot of weapons on offer here and they have some decent looking models and sounds for the most part, it's just that most of them range from bad to useless, and don't really get any better from there (see below for more).

The Bad
- Broken weapon balancing. Lots of firearms like the Pistol and Shotgun are incredibly weak, and melee is very low damage as well. Through pretty much the entire game only one gun is worth using, the M16. The M16 is an automatic weapon with high damage, low recoil and fast reloads, and so many enemies use it that it's almost impossible to run out of ammo for, making it the default weapon for pretty much the entire game.
- Map design is terrible. The maps in Postal III have very little in them and hidden items are almost non existant. Exploration is also totally gone, because the game is completely linear, instead of being able to go from map to map as you please, you're locked to single maps at a time and constantly forced into new missions.
- Unfunny humour. Like I said with my POSTAL 2 review, humour is subjective, so whether or not I find something funny won't really change whether others find it funny or not, but it seems that most people who've played it think that the attempts at jokes in Postal III were garbage, and I completely agree.
- No exploration. As I mentioned above, the game has no exploration besides the little exploring you can do in the maps you're locked inside, which generally don't include anything to find other than the occasional ammo pickup here and there. There is an unlockable free roam mode available after you finish the campaign, but there's nothing to do inside the free roam world other than pick up weapons and kill civilians, which doesn't feel fun or satisfying at all.
- No health items. Yes, that's right, Postal III completely removes health items and replaces them with a regenerating health mechanic which makes the only way to get health back sitting behind a wall and waiting.
- No difficulty options. Yeah, they removed those as well. POSTAL 2 had dozens of different difficulty options, Postal III has just one. This means that the game is always locked to one mode, easy as shit. The game has no real challenging moments at all, and I managed to complete the game without dying once with very little effort.
- Karma system. While POSTAL 2 let you play your way, it never punished you for choosing a certain style, Postal III does this a lot. The Karma system splits the game into 2 different paths, the Good Path and the Insane Path. On the Good Path you have to keep your Karma meter from dropping to bad, otherwise you get forced onto the Insane Path. On the Insane Path if you manage to fill your Karma meter up to good, you get the option to move on to the Good Path. The Karma bar is affected by how you deal with NPCs, if you kill unarmed people (and sometimes even armed attackers if the game just feels like being an unreasonable dick, which it does on certain missions) your karma will go down, leaving innocents alone and using non lethal weapons on enemies will bring the bar up again. This means that you are punished for being violent in Postal, a series which has always been about violence, this just ruins any potential fun the combat could've had, especially because the Insane Path is worse than the Good Path just by being more frustrating and tedious.

Overall, Postal III is a clearly unfinished and poorly thought out mess, clips of the game from 2007 up to its release in 2011 show that it changed a lot throughout development and its clear that the teams that worked on it just ran out of money and got desperate, hoping that booting the game out the door before it was properly finished would save them by making some small profits on release to recover the dev costs. It didn't, and Akella and Trashmasters are now dead as a result, Postal III clearly explains why, it's a broken, buggy and tedious mess that nobody should bother trying, even for a joke, it's just not worth wasting time on, it isn't even canon in the POSTAL universe anymore thanks to POSTAL 2 Paradise Lost retconning it, so you have no reason to bother with it, save your money and your time."

Negatív: 
- Játszhatalan! (a fő bosznál állandóan becrasher a játék, ezért nem lehet végigtolni!)
- Borzalmas irányítás
- Borzalmas zenék
- Kevés ""értelmes"" fegyver
- Nehéz kezdés (igaz, néha nagyon hülyék a karakterek)
- Ultra Low grafika és 10FPS ALATT? AZT HOGY??? (azt észrevettem, hogy Half Life 2/Left 4 Dead féle motorral készült a játék, de még azok sem mennek ennyire gyengén, mint ez, és ezáltal nagyon lassított felvételként megy az egész)
- Gyakran összeomlik (A Hobo-s küldetésnél és a legvégén Tankos diktátornál állandó jelleggel)
- Uncsi küldetések (véd a másikat, ameddig...)
- Kevés szabad mozgás, egyéni küldetés választás nincs (eddig legalább is nem találkoztam)...
- Ennyi észrevétel miatt szinte élvezhetetlen a játék...
- Nagyon hamar meglehet unni (hacsak nem vagy Mazochista)

Pozitív:
- Jó grafika (leszámítva, hogy gyakran 5-10FPS-re is lemegy a játékmenet)
- Képregényes cselekmények (amolyan Max Payne 1-es, de egész jó lett)
- Fedezékből is lehet lőni
- TE döntöd el, hogy JÓ fiú leszel, vagy ROSSZ (ha JÓ, akkor rendőr leszel mindaddig, amíg ROSSZRA nem válsz, ha ROSSZ fiú vagy, akkor szabadon gyilkolászhatsz és lehetsz Krotchy jelmezben is, mellesleg mini küldetések KARMÁTÓL függően más-más a feladatok teljesítése).
- Több videójelenet (mint a GTA3, de átugorható)
- Kevés cenzúra a játékban (nem cenzúrátlan, de örülnék, ha cenzúrátlan lenne az egész játék folyamat)
- Steam teljesítmények

Összegezve, örülök, hogy kevesebb mint féláron (5,10€)-ért vettem meg, de még így nagyon sokallom ezért a játékért, és sajnos  nekem egyáltalán nem jött be (szóval csak saját felelősséggel vedd meg a játékot, mint Postal fanatikus).
Igaz, hogy ez már nem az a Postal, mint az elődjei, de a fanatikusokat még megfogható (még ha nagyot fog ebben csalódni).

Ha mondjuk nem Source (Half Life) motorral készült volna vagy nem ilyen formában, mint ahogy most van, talán jobb is lehetett volna (főleg optimizálás terén, mert 5-10 FPS-el játszani Ultra Minimal-on azért elég ciki).

1: When a cat gets latched onto you, you have to spam left and right mouse to get it off. This wouldn't be a problem, but if you have the cat nip out, you can easily press right mouse, which consumes a ton of cat nip that's needed for the mission. Yes, it's limited. No, there are no refills (not as far as I could see)

2: The Chinese gang never stopped attacking me. And this is the second level, where my only weapons are cats, cat nip spray, and a vacuum. They had pistols, machetes, and M16s. Little unfair. Also, they never stopped respawning, leaving little time for me to grab the cats. I ended up having to throw a cat at one of the guys to grab a machete, which took some time. Which brings me to point 3.

3: Some weapons are broken. My favorite weapon from Postal 2, the machete, is reduced to a useless toy. The main attack took many attacks, and throwing it like a boomerang was hard. The machete wasn't thrown at the crosshair, rather below it, and even then it would miss a ton of targets. Also, it got stuck often, even when thrown in an open space.

After dying 3 times, the game crashed. I was dissapointed in this game. The gore is better than Postal 2 in my opinion, but there's so many glitches and the game is unfair on the earliest levels. Although, I'm probably one of the few who's okay with the new voice actor (mainly because Akella actually offered to have Rick Hunter voice the game, though he refused) and while some lines were pretty funny to me (""I blame pacman."") some lines pretty much made me cringe. (""Bacon bacon bacon!"" and other fire related lines) I also think I heard him say a really old meme (the cheeseburger one) but since this game was made in 2011 I can excuse that.

If you do plan on getting this game, turn off motion blur at the start. It'll save you a lot of headaches.

-Саундтрек. Реально приятный.
-Лопата стала довольно полезной.
-Неплохой графен.
А вот список минусов.:
-Почти всё оружие. Нормально можно использовать только огнестрел. Кувалда вообще урон не наносит. Да и куча оружия стало абсолютно бесполезным.
-Удовольствия от игры - 0. Я давно так не скучал, играя в игры. 
-Нет открытого мира. Не то, чтобы он тут был особо нужен, но возможно это хоть как-то помогло-бы игре.
-Дают задание доставить что-либо. Куда это доставить? Догадывайся!
-Однообразность. От миссий с пылесосом вообще тошнить в какой-то момент начинает.
-Баги, лаги, фризы, вылеты. Тысячи их!
-Предметы и оружие скинули в одну кучу. Это же пиздец как неудобно!!!
-Убогая анимация.
Итог: одна из дерьмовейших игр, в которые я играл, а ещё и худший постал.

ДНОООООООООООО","I'm sooooo fucking nuts. How could they screw this up so badly, developers? This isn't a post, this is some kind of GTA miscarriage. They've literally screwed up almost everything. Here's a list of what I liked:
-Soundtrack. Really nice.
-The shovel has become quite useful.
-Decent graphics.
And here's a list of the cons:
-Almost all weapons. Only firearms are usable properly. The sledgehammer doesn't do any damage at all. And a bunch of weapons have become completely useless.
-Enjoyment from the game - 0. I haven't been this bored playing a game in a long time.
-No open world. Not that it's particularly needed, but maybe it would have helped the game somehow.
-They give you a task to deliver something. Where do you deliver it? Guess what!
-Repetition. The vacuum cleaner missions actually make you sick at some point. - Bugs, lags, freezes, crashes. Thousands of them!
- Items and weapons thrown together. It's so fucking inconvenient!!!
- Poor animation.
Bottom line: one of the shittiest games I've ever played, and the worst yet.

I personally enjoy this game, but I can see why others don't. Many people ask if it's really *that* bad, and if they should pass on it or not... I think you should TRY it, especially if you're a fan of the previous games. But don't fart around, try rushing through as much as you can - that way you can still qualify for a refund, which you may want.

Pros:
+A good amount of weapons. Not as many as Postal 2, but more than most games.
+Though generally very cheesy, it has plenty of comedic moments.
+Goofy brand name refrences. A video game store with a game called Left 4 Bread, a coffee shop called Lotsofbucks or some shit, etc.
+Sticks to the usual Postal story. The Dude is broke, has troubles holding a job, and doesn't get his hard earned cash.
+Ability to choose whether you're good or bad (or neutral). This changes both gameplay and story, and gives you different missions.
+Pee simulator - part two?
+Neat soundtrack. And it suites the game.
+Boss fights are pretty solid, and can provide a challenge.
+Tons of fucking blood and gibs, as well as vulgarity and some dark humor.
+Tons of replayabiliy, as usual.
+Fun gameplay, though for some people it may get boring.

Neutral points (some might see as pros, while others see as cons):
N) Not in first-person as POSTAL 2 was
 But then again, let's not forget POSTAL 1 was a top-down shooter.
N) Bizarre weapons, such as AIDS infested cats, a badger that acts as a chainsaw, and a vacuum that sucks up small items and shoots them out (non-leathal, and barely ethical to use).
N) You have to unlock Free-roam by completing the game.


Cons:
-Not made by RWS. Hell, they don't even make money from this game!
-Bugs. Big bugs! We're talking tarantulas and genetically-altered cockroaches! You and other people will get stuck in certain spots, game crashes (I've rarely had this, though other people seem to have major issues with that), freezes from time to time, and many more. Some are smaller, and some... not so small.
-Lag can be a bitch at times, and the frame-rate can drop to -10 FPS.
-Repetitive story. You start your job, you and/or your employer get attacked, you defend the area, the boss doesn't like that, you don't get paid, and on to the next one.
-No trading cards.
-Since it's developed by a Russian company, the English isn't very good. Poor grammar and what not.
-No Rick Hunter, but the new Dude repeats gameplay phrases used in P2.
-Physics are all over the place. Sometimes when you shot someone in the head with a pistol, their head will pop off. Other times you'll use a fucking machine gun, and they'll just drop dead with no gibs. If you tase somebody then pour gasoline on them, they occasionally set on fire. See what I mean? The physics aren't consistent. 
-Achievements are glitched. Which ones, you ask? Depends on how unlucky you are. I've heard some people have issues with certain achievements I don't have issues with, and vice versa. Sometimes an achievement is apparently locked, sometimes doing the necessary tasks won't add up. I've spent half hour lighting people on fire, killing dozens of people, but my achievement progress was only 4/50.

Postal 3 это очень многострадальная игра.Её анонсировали чуть ли не сразу после выхода аддона для второй части.Правда вот RWS решили не делать её сами а отдать на аутсорс.Куда? Компании Акелла.Так как у них были хорошие отношения и вообще в наших краях Postal 2 стал мега культовым.Да и им понравился их мод Штопор Жжот.Данное решение было роковым.Ведь не зная специфики работы российских игровых компаний тех лет,RWS по факту поставили серию в очень тяжёлое положение.8 лет продолжался ад разработки.Обещали чуть ли не золотые горы и наш ответ GTA.

И вот в 2011 игра всё таки выходит.Оценки критиков и игроков были уничтожающими.И хотя игра неплохо продалась,вайб вокруг неё был просто ужасным.Невыполненные обещания,ужасная оптимизация,тонны вырезанного контента и общая трешовость.Акелла которая отказывалась признавать ошибки,релиз сперва был только на дисках с защитой StarForce.Релиз же в магазине Габена случился лишь через год и даже тут умудрились засунуть DRM защиту которая в 2022 году перестала работать и игру сняли с продажи.Но год спустя вернули да ещё выпустив 2 глобальных патча.

Сюжет-Чувак попадает в город Катарсис.Тоже в Аризоне.И пытается найти денег на бензин.Игру можно пройти по пути закона а можно по пути маньяка.От этого зависит не только концовка но и сами миссии.

Графика-Для игры был использован тогда ещё новый движок Source и игра всячески напоминает визуалом игры от Valve.Это не так уж плохо на самом деле.

Звук-Мой самый любимый саундтрек в серии.За Чувака тут на сей раз Кори Круз заменивший по некоторым причинам Рика Хантера.И он ещё сыграет нашего героя в будущем.В СНГ же вышла озвучка от Кураж Бамбей.Многим это не понравилось но блин,это лучше чем Груздев которому вообще было похyй кого он озвучивал.

Геймплей-В отличии от второй части где был около открытый мир,тут игра линейная и разделена на локации.Является ли это следствием движка,всё таки Source плохо умеет в открытый мир.Также игра теперь от третьего лица и на самом деле мне так даже ольше нравится.Арсенал оружия всё так же богат на разные бабахи,хотя и пропала например напалмавая пушка.Для мирного прохождения доступны Шокер,Перцовый балончик и Гамамёт.Который давали за предзаказ игры в магазине Gama-Gama а с патчем раздали всем.

Минусы-1)Несмотря на все усилия и 2 крупных апдейта игра остаётся рассадником глитчей.Хотя это намного лучше чем было на старте.Когда игра лагала на топовом железе,всё время вылетала и падала в частоте кадров.И это было странно учитывая что мы говорим про движок Source который славится своей оптимизацией.Сюда же игру механики которые не работают,типа пинок вообще вы не будете использовать.Ближный бой в принципе не работает.Из оружия нужен лишь стандартный огнестрел,вся экзотика лишь мешает.
2)История по сути филлерная и переполнена ужасным отечественным юмором.Сюда же идут ненужные камео (во второй части был только Гари Колман).При этом игра ну очень маленькая.Часа за 3 пройти по мирной ветке.Ну и ещё пару идя по злой.

Итог-Конечно Postal 3 не шедевр.Но были ли шедевром прошлые части? Нет.Да и вообще на удивление после того как RWS принялись топтать тройку,её популярность в сообществе лишь выросла.Почему? Ну вот вышла четвёртая часть,которая в принципе не работала толком.Да и нового ничего не предлагала.

У серии Postal фанбаза помещается в одной деревне и RWS знает для кого они делают игры.Но вот той ненависти тройка всяко не заслужила.Да и будем откровенны конечно Акелла знатно пролетела когда не поняла что к 2011 рынок изменился да и в целом до сих пор Архипов не признаёт ошибок.Но что RWS дали взамен? Шутки про г0вно и миссии по чистке г0вна.В таком случае лучше уж обкончанные салфетки в лицо феминисткам кидать.","[h1]The internet is to blame for everything[/h1]

Postal 3 is a very long-suffering game. It was announced almost immediately after the release of the add-on for the second game. However, RWS decided not to develop it themselves but to outsource it. Where? To Akella. They had a good relationship with them, and Postal 2 became a mega-cult in our area. And they liked their ""Corkscrew Burns"" mod. This decision was fatal. Unaware of the specifics of how Russian gaming companies worked at the time, RWS essentially put the series in a very difficult situation. Development hell continued for eight years. They promised mountains of gold and our answer to GTA.

And so, in 2011, the game finally came out. Critics and players alike slammed it. And although it sold well, the vibe around it was simply awful. Broken promises, terrible optimization, tons of cut content, and overall trashiness. Akella, who refused to admit mistakes, initially released it only on discs with StarForce protection. The release on Gaben's store only happened a year later, and even there they managed to slip in DRM protection, which stopped working in 2022 and the game was removed from sale. But a year later, it was brought back, along with two major patches.

The plot: The Dude ends up in the town of Catharsis, also in Arizona, and tries to find money for gas. You can play the game the law way, or the maniac way. This affects not only the ending but also the missions themselves.

Graphics - The game used the then-new Source engine, and its visuals are reminiscent of Valve games. It's not that bad, really.

Sound - My favorite soundtrack in the series. The Dude is played by Cory Cruz, who replaced Rick Hunter for some reason. And he'll play our hero again in the future. In the CIS, the voice acting was done by Kurazh Bombay. Many people didn't like it, but damn, it's better than Gruzdev, who didn't care who he was voicing.

Gameplay: Unlike the second game, which was more or less open-world, this one is linear and divided into locations. Is this a consequence of the engine? Source isn't very good at open-world gameplay. The game is also now third-person, and I actually like it better that way. The weapon arsenal is still rich with various weapons, although the napalm gun, for example, is gone. For peaceful play, the Shocker, Pepper Spray, and Gamamet are available. They were given to everyone with the patch and were given to everyone with the pre-order.

Cons: 1) Despite all the efforts and two major updates, the game remains a hotbed of glitches. Although it's much better than it was at launch. When the game lagged on high-end hardware, it crashed constantly and dropped frame rates. This was odd, considering we're talking about the Source engine, which is renowned for its optimization. There are also mechanics that don't work, like kicking, you won't use them at all. Melee combat is basically nonsensical. The only weapons you need are standard firearms; all the exotic ones just get in the way.
2) The story is essentially filler and overflowing with terrible Russian humor. There are also unnecessary cameos (in the second game, only Gary Coleman was featured). Moreover, the game is very short. It takes about three hours to complete the peaceful route. And then there's the evil route.

Bottom Line: Of course, Postal 3 is not a masterpiece. But were the previous games masterpieces? No. And surprisingly, after RWS started trashing the 3D series, its popularity in the community only grew. Why? Well, the fourth game came out, and it basically didn't work properly. And it didn't offer anything new.

The Postal series has a fanbase the size of a village, and RWS knows who they're making games for. But the 3D series certainly didn't deserve all that hate. And let's be honest, Akella really lost out when they didn't realize the market had changed by 2011, and Arkhipov still refuses to admit his mistakes. But what did RWS give in return? Jokes about shit and missions to clean it up. In that case, it's better to throw shit-stained napkins in the faces of feminists."

Выкупив права на игру,её сделала студия с названием Trash masters,как говориться ""как лодку назовешь так она и поплывет""
Название студии само за себя говорит.Ах да, игра на движке source.

Потом нужно будет собирать кошек бегая от китайцев с дубинками,и мачете.

Grotekstic villains, mind-blowing missions, gripping gameplay, and, as usual, a cleverly twisted social satire plot await the Dude, and you too.

Having acquired the rights to the game, a studio called Trash Masters developed it. As the saying goes, ""As you name the boat, so it will float.""
The studio's name speaks for itself. Oh yeah, the game is powered by the Source engine.
Some things in the game have completely changed, while others remain. The signature dark humor, the charismatic protagonist, the rich arsenal. But the game itself is complete trash. Let's start with the first mission, which ""introduces"" the player to the game. No, they didn't show the game's world or start any interesting narrative. Instead, you're forced to collect soiled napkins in some club...which you have to vacuum up.

Then you'll have to collect cats while running from Chinese with clubs and machetes.
There's also one very ""interesting mission"" in the game where a bull, painted like a cow and high on amphetamines, with a gay cowboy on his back, fights a S.W.A.T. fighter. I wonder how they even came up with something like that.
Also, throughout your playthrough, the game will constantly lag, crash, and freeze. If, after all this, you still decide to play this complete piece of crap that you can't even call a game, then good riddance. If you want to play it properly, you'll have to do a few more things: find the game in your Steam library, select ""Set Launch Options"" in the properties, and then add this: + host_thread_mode 2 + mat_queue_mode2

The fact that this game wears the name Postal is a disgrace.
Everything you loved about the Postal franchise gets raped by a bad Russian publisher who took in fact many years to create this broken crap product. It was also released way too early. I hope Akella is dead. RWS got pretty much ignored when this product was created. Also Akella and the last dev team left the product to die. Not even a proper source code has been released. This makes it nearly impossible to fix or mod the game. The game is so bad that many game functionalities are simply not working like melee weapon hit detection. To this comes bad performance and crashes. Story and gameplay wisely this product is a joke anyway. I wouldn't waste my time with this product and you shouldn't neither. Buy Paradise Lost instead. Or wait for Postal 3 Unreal. A Postal 3 remake in the unreal engine. Remade from scratch! Also there is Catharsis Reborn. Some sort of remake/sequel/alternative game in the Postal 3 Source engine. They might be able to create something good with it. I waited so long for it, but it was just crap in the end. Sad story...

My Rating? None, I simply dont want to rate a broken alpha product. Not worth it.
If you really need to try this game, get it somewhere ""free"" or get a very very cheap key.
Sometimes RWS also gives some out for free, as demonstration how bad the game is.
Im honest, I didnt finish the game. I guess some years ago I made it to the half with tons of crashes. Recently I got the Steam version for a cheap price. Its nearly as bad as it was when it was released. I simply cant bring myself to play this shit to end. Seriously. This game rapes me, I demand injury compensation!

Positive:
- Partly nice art design
- Soundtrack
- I like the ""evil"" twin Postal Dude's design and new voice, cool that it was reused in Paradise Lost

Negative:
- Bugs and crashes
- Performance problems
- Sound mixing problems, too loud, too quiet, missing sounds, unfitting sounds
- Melee weapons have a hit detection thats probably the worst ever
- No free roam
- Boring repetitive missions
- Bad English grammar and text
- Akella sucks

It may could have been a good game if they let RWS help with the development. But instead there was silence between both devs and Akella just made it worse with releasing it fast. This was the death for the game. RWS regrets this game a lot and I doubt that there will ever be something like this happening again.

UPDATE 2022:
Well, nothing changed, surprise. I actually gave this game another go and its as bad as ever. I actually tried to force myself through to the end but I almost gave up at the endboss since the game just crashed all few mins to the point that the game was almost not finishable. Molotovs and the rocket launcher also instantly crash the game or kill you. It is just a sad shame and the fact that no one can fix it due to missing source code is a shame. Akella deserves the worst. Also most of the achievements are completely broken or only unlock in very specific ways. I was thinking about getting them all just because I am a Postal fan but so much for that I guess. I still recommend to avoid the game, there just isn't any meaningful (or working) content here.

Luckily the mods Postal 3 Unreal and Catharsis Reborn actually have come far in the past 6 years since my review. Check the products out on YouTube. The latest gameplay trailers look so promising and they are definitely far into development.","One Word...

There are so many downsides to the game. I don't see the point in listing them. So where are the pros, and why do I play it? You ask. It's all about the dark humor, and there's plenty of it: bullying various people, dirty jokes, funny dialogue, and an excellent living weapon, Badger (Badger. Badger. Mushrooms. Mushrooms). A controllable crazy monkey. There are plenty of weapons, but they're buggy. The missions are crazy, sometimes successful and funny. But for the most part, they're not particularly interesting. A good soundtrack sometimes saves the day. Interesting characters (Ron Jeremy, for example). What can I say, there's even Mavrodi. Sitting after work with a bottle of beer, shooting, and running around to relax—that's just what I'm for. I absolutely don't recommend it to anyone and would give it a neutral review. This game is clearly for an amateur or a pervert. This game is a shining example of domestic trash game development. Akella was the one who created this ""miracle."" It took a lot of effort to screw up the Source engine and spend so much money on development like that. Fortunately, they won't be trusted to develop RWS games anymore. I hope most fans of the series will forget this as a bad dream."

Читая, на протяжении половины десятилетия, множество нелестных отзывов о последней нормерной части любимой серии, невольно задумываешься: ""Что же они такого могли сделать с игрой, что её все ругают"". И не доверяя слепой критике, начинаем играть и оценивать. 

...

И окончив игру, становится всё понятно. В данной рецензии, искренне попытаюсь показать что-то хорошее по каждому пункту игры, а потом добью это ужасными недостатками.     


Неторопливое прохождение заняло: 6ч.  

[h1] Сюжет и лор[/h1]
Хорошее: 
Разработчики смогли использовать идею того что теоретически можно проходить такую игру, как postal гуманно, без убийств. И эта система кармы влияет на развитие сюжета. В игре есть несколько концовок, зависящих от стиля прохождения игры. 
Комиксы во время игры. Они были сделаны хорошо. В начале рассказывается вся история серии в комиксах и концовки нарисованы в комиксах (что-то вроде послесловия). Качественно, смешно. 
Группы недовольных людей с которыми нужно драться стилизованы лучше, чем просто майка какого-то цвета, теперь у них есть атрибутика. 
Персонажи неплохо запоминаются, возможно потому что их всего 3? 

И не очень:
Ужас и содомия вместо сюжета тут. В своих расчётах разработчик допустил фатальную ошибку. Рассчитывали на то что фанаты игры откровенное быдло, которому смешно от того что можно нассать на человека или от того что гавно лежит на улице, или от того что кто-то дрочит. Но это не так. Игра так переигрывает с абсурдом в сюжете, что ты перестаёшь ей верить. Ты перестаёшь чувствовать это единение с игрой, эту интерактивность. Ты просто бегаешь и нажимаешь кнопки, которые тебе говорят. Это отталкивает. Вся игра - набор однотипных миссий убей (обезвредь) столько-то людей. Всё! 
Проплаченная реклама МММ. Это просто добивает. Только русские могут такую хрень устроить. Вы вспомните, 2011г, игра как раз выходит, Мавроди как раз собирает свою секту снова, ..., атата, Мавродий появляется в игре, еще и с подробностями того, что там у него и где в секте на халяву. Причём появляется он там на несколько секунд, реально. Как рекламный блог. Хотя в титрах во всех объявлен. Подозрительно, да? 


[h1] Графика[/h1]
Хорошее: 
Идея с гротескным (комичным) изображением людей была может быть неплохой.  

И не очень:
Устаревшая графика еще на момент выхода. 


[h1] Техническая часть[/h1]
Хорошее: 
Новый дивжок позволил сделать некоторые движения реалистичнее, но это заслуга движка, будем честны. Им еще нужно научиться пользоваться, правильно? 

И не очень:
Игра откровенно не оптимизированная и забагованная. Только на i7-6700K удалось заставить её идти в нормальном фпс в баталиях. 

[h1] Звук и музыка[/h1]
Хорошее: 
Сама музыка хорошая. Иногда даже поставлена в тему текущему на экране безумию.  
Озвучивание от кураж бамбей может и не плохо было сделано.  

И не очень:
Звуки просто иногда не работают, некоторые звуки не сделаны. Некоторые глючат и скрепят, трещат на максимальной громкости. 
Баланс громкости музыки и звуков не соблюдён нигде. Отвратительно всё это слышать.  

[h1] Геймплей[/h1]
Хорошее: 
Люди разлетаются на кусочки интереснее. Эти кусочки обдают всё кровью чуть больше, чем раньше в играх серии. 

И не очень:
Игру просто НЕ ТЕСТИРОВАЛИ. С реальными усилиями получается проходить задания, постоянно отслеживая, не застрял ли твой спутник в текстурах, потому что ты проиграешь или вовсе потеряешь его и не сможешь завершить задание. 
Мир не открытый - игра по сути линейна, с точностью до перестановки миссий. 
Анимация ужасная. 
Управление ужасное. Играть почти невозможно.  
Блюют люди не реалистично, намного хуже чем в частях ранее.

[h1] Итого[/h1]
Это ужасно. Не играйте в это. Даже фанаты серии. Даже адские фанаты серии. Ощущение, что это проект школьников для урока информатики.","[h1]General[/h1]
After reading the many unflattering reviews of the last decent installment in a beloved series for half a decade, you can't help but wonder, ""What could they have done to the game that everyone is criticizing it?"" And, not trusting blind criticism, we start playing and evaluating.

...

And after finishing the game, everything becomes clear. In this review, I will sincerely try to highlight the positive aspects of each aspect of the game, and then I will finish it off with the terrible flaws.

A leisurely playthrough took: 6 hours.

[h1] Plot and Lore[/h1]
The Good:
The developers were able to exploit the idea that it is theoretically possible to play a game like Postal humanely, without killing. And this karma system influences the plot. The game has multiple endings, depending on your playstyle.

The comics during the game. They were well done. The beginning tells the entire story of the series in comics, and the endings are drawn in comics (sort of like an afterword). It's high-quality and funny.

The groups of disgruntled people you have to fight are more stylized than just a random T-shirt; they now have merchandise.

The characters are quite memorable, perhaps because there are only three of them?

And not so much:
Horror and sodomy instead of a plot. The developer made a fatal mistake in their calculations. They were counting on the game's fans being downright idiots who find it funny that someone can pee on someone, or that shit is lying on the street, or that someone is masturbating. But that's not the case. The game overdoes the absurdity in the plot so much that you stop believing it. You lose that connection with the game, that interactivity. You're just running around and pressing the buttons that tell you to. It's off-putting. The whole game is a series of similar missions: kill (neutralize) so many people. That's it!
Paid MMM advertising. It's just killing me. Only the Russians could pull off such crap. Remember, it was 2011, the game was just coming out, and Mavrodi was just getting his sect back together again... ah, Mavrodi appears in the game, even giving details of what he has and where he is in the sect for free. And he only appears for a few seconds, really. Like an advertising blog. Even though he's announced in all the credits. Suspicious, right?

[h1] Graphics[/h1]
Good:
The idea of ​​grotesque (comical) depictions of people might have been a good one.

And not so good:
The graphics were outdated even at the time of release.

[h1] Technical [/h1]
The good:
The new DivJock allowed for more realistic movement, but let's be honest, that's thanks to the engine. You still need to learn how to use it, right?

The bad:
The game is clearly unoptimized and buggy. Only on an i7-6700K was it possible to get it to run at a decent frame rate in battles.

[h1] Sound and Music [/h1]
The good:
The music itself is good. Sometimes it even fits the madness playing on screen.

The voiceover by Courage Bombay might have been good.

The bad:
The sounds just don't work sometimes, and some sounds aren't implemented. Some glitchy, creak, and crackle at maximum volume.

The volume balance between music and sounds is off anywhere. It's disgusting to hear all of this.

[h1] Gameplay[/h1]
The good:
People explode into pieces more interestingly. These pieces splatter everything with a bit more blood than in previous games in the series.

The bad:
The game simply HAS NOT BEEN TESTED. Missions require real effort to complete, constantly monitoring whether your companion gets stuck in textures, because you'll lose or even lose them and be unable to complete the mission.

The world isn't open—the game is essentially linear, down to the way missions are rearranged.

The animation is terrible.
The controls are terrible. It's almost impossible to play.
The vomiting isn't realistic, much worse than in previous games.

сейчас 2023, с 2015 по 2022 я возвращался иногда к этой игре, по приколу пробегал её за 3 часа (ибо постал 3 очень короткий), и при этом не забывал про прошлые части. и каждый раз, комьюннити тройки находило что-то новое, например та же 3-я концовка, билды 2008-2009 года. появились модификации, которые почти довели игру до стабильного состояния. даже помню был мод на двойку, там постал 3 перенесли в постал 2. вопрос на миллион, почему если эту игру так сильно критиковали и её игнорили даже сами RWS, были люди-фанаты, которые доделали всё-таки её, а сейчас вообще у игры резко стали смешанные отзывы вместо очень отрицательных? вопрос открытый.

конечно, на фоне постала 2, постал 3 выглядит очень забавно и тупо. это и третье лицо, и опять же счётчик кармы, ужасный ИИ. просто у игры сплошные проблемы. но сейчас я впервые прошёл постал 3 с модами, которые есть в руководствах стима. И у меня ни разу не вылетела игра, мне было комфортно пользоваться всякими плюшками что придумали разрабы, и угарать с этой неполиткорректности, которой нету в нынешнее время. я могу теперь сказать, что постал 3 будет лучше чем Postal 4 и Paradise Lost, ибо эти 2 вещи от оригинальных разрабов я даже всерьёз не хочу воспринимать. смешно что аддон Brain Damaged на голову выше этих двух подделок, ага. 

в кратце скажу: постал 3 это очень специфический продукт, в который играть сложно из-за местных особенностей, о которых я выше писал. но если вы сможете всё перебороть, не поленитесь поставить моды, которые игру сделают более комфортной, впишите одну консольную команду чтобы у вас не было проблем со звуком, или ещё лучше поставите оригинальную озвучку, хоть и Бамбей озвучил игру очень аутентично (опять же в руководствах всё в топе висит, смотрите сами, это делается всё за минуту), вы получите крайне забавную вещь, которая под пиво проходится за один присест и заставит вас возвращаться. нынче эти баги с физикой, искуственный интеллект (сейчас кстати всё даже лучше стало, ибо я когда играл, у меня нпс которых надо было спасти тупо на месте стояли, а сейчас они хоть идти нормально могут) и ужасная боёвка смотрятся очень смешно. но блин, этот трэшовый сюжет с его грайндхаусовской подачей, множество аллюзий на чёрный юмор, музыка, и общая анархия игры сейчас доставляет. ещё и за 40 рублей по скидке, лол, вам парни вообще повезло)

I can talk about the first Postal for ages; it's still my favorite game in the series (180 hours in the original game and 170 in the redux), and I can say that Uwe's Postal is the best film adaptation of the game. When I registered on Steam, I immediately got the first and second Postal for cheap, and in 2015 I got Postal 3 (it cost about 120 rubles, I think, or 140, it doesn't matter). Naturally, I was hesitant, especially knowing the criticism the game received, what kind of reviews it got, and how, for 140 rubles at the time, you could have gotten something cooler than some trash from our guys. And it's not surprising - Postal 3 was in really bad shape at the time, it kept crashing for me, the melee combat was annoying, and then there was that karma... Anyway, I forced myself to get the good ending the first time, then the bad ending again. It was unpleasant to play, but something kept me hooked. It was probably because it was built on the Source engine, and it had crappy humor that only a domestic gamer-turned-degenerate like me, who was giggling at terebonek or whatever was popular back then, would understand. And of course, the music in the game is truly top-notch, I'll give it a thumbs up in advance.

It's 2023 now, and from 2015 to 2022 I returned to this game occasionally, running through it in three hours for fun (since Postal 3 is very short), and I didn't forget the previous games. And every time, the Troika community found something new, like the third ending, the 2008-2009 builds. Mods appeared that almost brought the game to a stable state. I even remember there was a mod for the second, where Postal 3 was transferred to Postal 2. The million-dollar question is: if this game was so heavily criticized and even RWS themselves ignored it, there were fans who finally finished it, and now the game suddenly has mixed reviews instead of very negative ones? It's an open question.

Of course, compared to Postal 2, Postal 3 looks very funny and stupid. It's third-person, and again, the karma counter, terrible AI. The game is simply full of problems. But now I've completed Postal 3 for the first time with the mods that are in the Steam guides. And the game never crashed for me, I was comfortable using all the perks the developers came up with, and I had a blast with this political incorrectness that doesn't exist these days. I can now say that Postal 3 will be better than Postal 4 and Paradise Lost, because I don't even want to take those two games from the original developers seriously. It's funny that the Brain Damaged add-on is head and shoulders above those two knockoffs, yeah.

In short, Postal 3 is a very specific product, difficult to play due to the local peculiarities I mentioned above. But if you can overcome everything, don't be lazy and install mods that will make the game more comfortable, enter one console command to eliminate sound issues, or even better, install the original voice acting, although Bambey voiced the game very authentically (again, everything is at the top of the guides, see for yourself, it's all done in a minute), you'll get an extremely funny thing that can be completed in one sitting with a beer and will keep you coming back. Nowadays, these physics bugs, artificial intelligence (by the way, everything has become even better now, because when I played, the NPCs I needed to rescue were stupidly standing in place, and now they can at least walk normally) and terrible combat look very funny. But damn, this trashy plot with its grindhouse presentation, numerous allusions to black humor, the music, and the general anarchy of the game are now a joy. And it's even on sale for 40 rubles, lol, you guys are so lucky!

Just don't expect anything and you'll have a blast. It's by no means on the level of the masterpiece first game or the more or less decent second, but it's still a decent product that became a phenomenon thanks to modders and the recent update that brought the game back to Steam. So give it a try, especially since the game is very short; it'll take you a maximum of 5 hours to complete both the good and bad endings.

Немного о сюжете игры и возможностях в игре. 
Главный герой игры,Чувак переезжает из Парадайс сити (потому что его взорвали)в соседний город Катарсис.Для того что бы хоть как-то свести концы с концами,Чувак,меняет одну работу  на другую.Чуваку ничто по жизни не давалось легко, и в этот раз на его пути встают то полицейские, то эко-фанатики, то байкеры-геи.Но выбор всегда есть,и вы можете стать на сторону закона и очищать улицы от бандитов или же снова наполнить их кровью!В игре так же присутствуют множество различных боссов,которые по своему уникальны.Оружия в игре масса,барсуки,серпы,пистолеты и много различных винтовок ждут вас в этой игре. 
По мнению геймеров и критиков,игра провалилась. Город не такой большой,как казалось,неинтересный сюжет,неудобное управление.
Так что,не советую вам покупать эту игру :--)","Postal III is a third-person shooter like its predecessors. It's developed using Valve's Source engine, which was first used in Half-Life 2.

A little about the game's plot and features:

The game's protagonist, the Dude, moves from Paradise City (because it was blown up) to the neighboring town of Catharsis. To make ends meet, the Dude trades jobs. Nothing has ever come easy for the Dude, and this time, he faces challenges from the police, eco-fanatics, and gay bikers. But there's always a choice: you can side with the law and clear the streets of bandits or fill them with blood again! The game also features a variety of unique bosses. Weapons abound, including badgers, sickles, pistols, and a variety of rifles. According to gamers and critics, the game was a failure. The city wasn't as big as it seemed, the plot was uninteresting, and the controls were awkward.
So, I don't recommend buying this game. :--)"

Postal 3 is not a masterpiece and isn’t as good as the second one, but still enjoyable if you like the Postal series and don’t mind buggy gameplay and an occasional crash, consider buying the game on sale.
[b]Overall Score:[/b] 62/100

[h1]Extensive Review[/h1]
Right off the bat, I love the Postal games for being violent, funny and because the Postal Dude is an epic protagonist. If you loved Postal 2 and want more, Postal 3 is probably right for you. It is by far not as good or as bug-free, but entertaining none the less. Get it when it is on sale, because it sadly isn’t worth the 20$ they want. I got it on sale and regret nothing.

[b]Campaign & Story[/b]
It is a lot shorter than Postal 2 but instead offers different branches based on your actions during missions. This means you can replay the game a good 3 times and will have new content or at least a different story. The narrator and characters are funny, and the dialogue fits the Postal series nicely. The cutscenes have an annoying film grain, but are still funny. The story is not meant to be taken seriously and progresses nicely. But let’s face it, we play Postal to kill people and not to evaluate the Dude’s life choices.

[b]Graphics & Performance[/b]
Here is where the game is weak. Many others report crashes, poor frame rates and bugs. I experienced that as well, but if you are patient (not mashing your mouse when the game freezes for a sec) and change the settings to suit your system you should be fine. I did not run the game at ultra settings because programming wise it is not optimized and sometimes the animations are poorly integrated. Movement controls and aiming are not ideal, and some maps or many enemies might lag at times. Loading screens are long, but that might just be my rig. All these performance issues [i]DO NOT[/i] take away from the game being fun and enjoyable. If you are willing to live with some issues you can still have a blast with Postal 3. It ran fairly well and smooth for me for the most part.

[b]Gameplay and Experience[/b]
The gameplay is okay and you get used to it not being great quickly. Movement and looking work fine, and the NPCs are responsive (not as good as Postal 2, but still fun to kill). They used some similar voice actors or audio files and many references are made to the previous game. There are plenty of weapons to choose from, including a freaking badger and angry bees. You can urinate, incinerate people, and ride a segway. Overall it is fun and the gore is nice as well. It is different from Postal 2, and if you keep in mind that essentially a team of fans made this with the source engine, any “disappointments” won’t bother you. The achievements are bugged, but you can get a good 70%.

[b]Conclusion[/b]
If you love the Postal series and this game is on sale, go get it. It is fun, silly and amusing for a piece of garbage. If you can look past some performance issues, this game is great! Seriously, I enjoyed every minute of it but get it on sale. If you don’t like it then it’s 5$ gone and not 20$. I highly recommend it to Postal fans. I regret nothing!","[h1]Short Review[/h1]

Может в русскую версию пихнули какое-то гавно, Из-за которого и лагает,тупят NPC,Озвучка хромает напишите в консоли snd_rebuildsoundcache и игра вылетит, и надо обратно зайти и всё! Profit.
Oтключите HDR, резкость движений Включите,В консоли пропишите r_3dsky 0, Вот и всё что я могу дополнить.","It lags in some places, but the game cost me 109 rubles :3.
I really liked the voice acting, music, and characters.
People are dumb and don't know what will happen if you beat the game—of course, everyone will discover an interesting OPEN WORLD!
Complaining about lag? Solution: Set Anti-Aliasing to 2 or 4 (not recommended on computers since those days), disable it using the PsyhX fix. In the autoexec files, set shadows to 0, and ragdolls to 0 or 1. 60FPS was still limited for me.
- Cons: During the boss fight (Uwe Chavez), the game crashes when climbing up. NPCs are slow.
Okay, I'll give it a 6.9/10. Oddly enough, they love the game in America. I've never seen a video about Postal III from Americans, but it got a lot of likes and good reviews. Maybe it's all because of the Russian version. For some reason, Americans haven't had crashes or glitches with sound or NPCs while playing.
Maybe they shoved some crap into the Russian version, which is causing the lag, the NPCs are slow, the voice acting is terrible. Type snd_rebuildsoundcache in the console, and the game will crash, and you have to go back and that's it! Profit.
Disable HDR, enable motion sharpness, and type r_3dsky 0 in the console. That's all I can add."

Ohne Postal 2 könnte Postal 3 nicht sein. Das fängt mit dem nervigen Intro an, indem 5 Minuten lang erklärt wird, was in Postal 2 passiert ist. Dann 2 Sekunden Spielzeit, dann Videosequenz, dann 2 Sekunden Spielzeit, dann Videosequenz. Toll ist auch der Einsetz von schlecht eingekaufter und gewählter Musik.

Postal 3 couldn't exist without Postal 2. It starts with the annoying intro, which spends 5 minutes explaining what happened in Postal 2. Then 2 seconds of gameplay, then a cutscene, then 2 seconds of gameplay, then a cutscene. The use of poorly sourced and selected music is also great. Postal 2 probably had a homemade soundtrack that emphasized the atmosphere. Morbid, dark, but also fucking funny. The songs don't even loop properly. If Postal 2 has bloody sputum with pus, then that's Postal 3. I see this part as something independent and don't want this game to be associated with Postal 2. In my opinion, it would have been a good greenlight/pre-alpha title with a season pass. So you're surprised that pirated copies are taking over...?"

20116734,polish,2015.11.30 19:05,❌,✅,0.941875577,290,"Jedno słowo... ""Czemu?"" Postal III miał w sobie taki potencjał, gdyby tą grę przez cały czas produkcji tworzyło studio Running With Scissors, a nie jakaś ruska firma TrashMasters to ta gra była by prawdopodobnie naprawde dobra. Ba! Mogła by być lepsza niż dwójka! Zwłaszcza że działa na o wiele lepszym silniku niż poprzedniczka (czyli na Source engine znanym z Half Life 2). Ale tak jednak nie jest. Postal III jest w zasadzie pod każdym względem gorszy od Postal 2... tak, pod każdym! W dwójce byłą lepsza: Fabuła i świat gry, był lepszy gameplay, były lepsze bronie a nawet optymalizacja (CO JEST CHOLERA DZIWNE BO TRÓJKA DZIAŁA NA LEPSZYM SILNIKU) A nawet mam wrażenie że grafika w dwójce była lepsza... Ale od początku: W grze wcielamy się ponownie w Kolesia a gra dzieje się po wydarzeniach z dodatku do dwójki ""Apocalypse Weekend"". Jak wiemy na końcu owego dodatku, w paradise wybucha bomba atomowa zaś koleś wraz ze swym psem Champ'em ucieka z tego pięknego miasteczka. Koleś trafia do sąsiedniego miasta Catharsis a naszym zadaniem będzie po prostu znalezienie pracy. Co jest nie tak z fabułą? No cóż po pierwsze sam Koleś. Zmienił się nie do poznania a przecież akcja gry dzieje się zaraz po wydarzeniach z dodatku! Ale nie tylko sam wygląd się zmienił, aktor głosowy również i nie wiem jak wam ale mi ten z dwójki podobał się o wiele bardziej. Nawet charakter naszego Kolesia się zmienił! Teraz nie jest socjopatą którego wkurza głupota świata który jest dookoła niego, teraz jest socjopatą żartowniśiem. Sama fabuła jest w wielu momentach kompletnie bez sensu (uwaga nawiasowy spojler ale co z tego: W pewnym momencie gry odnajdujemy spowrotem naszego psa Champa który to radośnie rzucił się na bezdomnego i zaczął gryść mu yyy krotchy'ego (If you know what i mean) w tym samym momencie przychodzi do nas jakaś policjantka i mówi że jest to złe trafiamy do sądu i odbierają nam psa... czy koleś nie mógł jej po prostu zabić lub uciec? Ależ nie musiał pójść grzecznie z ową policjanktą do sądu...) i takich sytuacji jest całkiem sporo... No ale dobra fabułą nigdy w Postal'u nie była najważniejsza, jak prezentuje się rozgrywka? Jednym słowem kiepsko: Walka wręcz bardzo często się nie sprawdza, po prostu bardzo ciężko trafić czymś cokolwiek!, Broń palna była by ok gdyby nie ten cholerny skaczący celownik!, broń miotna sprawuje się nieźle o dziwo jest całkiem przyjemny i prosty system celowania do granatów i tym podobnym. Szkoda że walka została popsuta bo sam arsenał prezentuje się wyśmienicie: Prócz powracających klasyków takich jak Łopata, M16, Maczeta, koktail mołotowa, Karnister na benzyne mamy też wiele nowych świetnie wymyślonych i pasujących do realii postal'a broni na przykład: Borsuk którym możemy szczuć przechodniów, ul pszczół który działa troche jak granat, zmodyfikowany odkurzacz którym możemy wssysać niektóre przedmioty a potem nimi strzelać, Interaktywna małpka czy bomba Krotchy. Niestety mimo świetnych pomysłów bronie te często się nie sprawdzają, w zasadzie to najlepiej jest przejść grę używając tylko pistoletu czy M16. A Przeciwnicy to kompletni debile: Czasem się zdarza że nas w ogóle nie zauważą, często zaczynają do nas strzelać dopiero po jakiś 4 sekundach patrzenia. Pamiętacie jak w Postal 2 mogliśmy mimo zadań które dostawaliśmy na początku dnia eksplorować te piękne miasteczko zaglądając do domów, mordujać przechodniów i szukając coraz to lepszego wyposarzenia? Cóż tutaj jest kompletnie inaczej. Główny wątek fabularny niesie nas automatycznie z misji na misje... Ale hej! Przecież po zakończeniu gry mamy Free roam! I co z tego? Gdzie tu znaleść zabawe skoro mapa jest malutka, możemy wejść może do dwóch czy trzech domów a o owej zabawnej eksploracji możemy zapomnieć bo dostajemy na początku wszystkie bronie, przechodnie to debile podobnie jak policjanci którzy w ogóle nas nie szukają gdy coś przeskrobiemy no i nie ma mapy żeby spojrzeć gdzie się znajdujemy... Grafika jest dość średniawa, sam disajn ulic i budynków mi się całkiem podoba ale modele postaci czy efekty specjalne... fłe. Nowy głos kolesia Choć co prawda gorszy niz poprzedni to sprawuje się całkiem nieźle... lepiej niż wszystkie inne pozostałe głosy postaci który są dobrane dość kiepsko. Same efekty dźwiękowe są ok. Muzyka jest całkiem niezła w większości zwłaszcza główny motyw który mi się podobał, soundtrack to chyba jedyna rzecz która została tu zrobiona całkowicie dobrze. Pomimo tego że jest to gra kiepska, to momentami może dać troche zabawy, ale tylko momentami. Jeżeli planujecie kupić jakiegoś postala to KUPUJCIE DWÓJKE to najlepsza część, jeżeli chcecie więcej kupćie dodatek do dwójki, jeśli chcecie jeszcze więcej kupcie ewentualnie jedynke bo zła nie jest tylko stara. Ale nie kupujcie trójki. Szkoda że tak wyszło, przeczesałem troche internetu żeby popatrzeć jak się prezentowała ta gra przed premierą kiedy należała jeszcze do RWS i cóż.. Wszystkie te zabawne bronie oni wymyślili, mapa miała być więsza niż w dwójce i miał być w pełni otwarty świat, miał być zrobiony multiplayer a sama gra miała wyjść także na Xbox 360 i PS3. Gdyby nie ci ruscy :(. Postal 3 zasługuje na 4/10","One word... ""Why?"" Postal III had so much potential. If this game had been developed throughout its entire development by the studio Running With Scissors, and not some Russian company called TrashMasters, it would probably have been really good. It could have been better than the second one! Especially since it runs on a much better engine than its predecessor (the Source engine known from Half-Life 2). But that's not the case. Postal III is inferior to Postal 2 in basically every way... yes, every way! The second one was better: the story and the game world, the gameplay was better, the weapons were better, and even the optimization (WHICH IS STRANGE, BECAUSE THE 3RD RUNS ON A BETTER ENGINE). And I even have the impression that the graphics in the second one were better... But let's start from the beginning: In the game, we once again play as the Dude, and the game takes place after the events of the second expansion pack, ""Apocalypse Weekend."" As we know at the end of that expansion, a nuclear bomb explodes in Paradise, and the guy and his dog, Champ, flee this beautiful town. The guy ends up in the neighboring city of Catharsis, and our task is simply to find a job. What's wrong with the plot? Well, first of all, the guy himself. He's changed beyond recognition, even though the game takes place immediately after the events of the expansion! But not only has his appearance changed, the voice actor has changed as well, and I don't know about you, but I liked the voice actor much better. Even the guy's personality has changed! Now he's not a sociopath who's irritated by the stupidity of the world around him; he's a prankster sociopath. The plot itself is completely pointless at many points (warning: parenthetical spoiler, but so what: At one point in the game we find our dog Champ back, who happily attacked a homeless man and started biting his, uh, Krotchy (If you know what I mean), at the same time a policewoman comes to us and says it's wrong, we end up in court and they take our dog away... couldn't the guy just kill her or run away? He didn't have to politely go to court with that policewoman...) and there are quite a few such situations... But a good plot has never been the most important thing in Postal. How is the gameplay? In a word, it's poor: Melee combat very often doesn't work, it's just very hard to hit anything with anything! Firearms would be okay if it weren't for that damn bouncing crosshair! Throwing weapons work well, surprisingly, there's a quite pleasant and simple aiming system for grenades and the like. It's a shame the combat has been ruined, because the arsenal itself looks fantastic: Besides returning classics like the Shovel, M16, Machete, Molotov Cocktail, and Gas Can, we also have many new, brilliantly designed weapons that fit the Postal setting, such as the Badger, which we can use to set passersby off, the Bee Hive, which works a bit like a grenade, a modified vacuum cleaner that we can use to suck up objects and then shoot them, the Interactive Monkey, and the Krotchy bomb. Unfortunately, despite their brilliant ideas, these weapons often fail to deliver. In fact, it's best to play through the game using only a pistol or M16. And the enemies are complete idiots: sometimes they don't even notice us, often starting shooting after about four seconds of looking. Remember how in Postal 2, despite the tasks we were given at the beginning of the day, we could explore this beautiful town, peeking into houses, murdering passersby, and searching for better equipment? Well, this is completely different. The main storyline automatically carries us from mission to mission... But hey! After all, after the game, we have Free Roam! So what? Where's the fun in this game when the map is tiny, we can only enter two or three houses, and we can forget about fun exploration because we're given all the weapons at the beginning, the pedestrians are idiots, like the police who don't even look for us if we do something wrong, and there's no map to see where we are... The graphics are pretty average. I quite like the street and building designs, but the character models and special effects... yuck. The new voice acting, while worse than the previous one, works quite well... better than all the other character voice acting, which is rather poorly chosen. The sound effects themselves are okay. The music is pretty good, especially the main theme, which I liked. The soundtrack is probably the only thing that's done completely well here. Despite being a bad game, it can be a bit entertaining at times, but only at times. If you're planning to buy Postal 2, BUY it. It's the best part. If you want more, buy the expansion for Postal 2. If you want even more, buy Postal 1 because it's not just bad, it's old. But don't buy Postal 3. It's a shame it turned out this way. I scoured the internet to see what the game looked like before its release, when it was still part of the RWS franchise, and well... they invented all those funny weapons, the map was supposed to be bigger than in Postal 2, it was supposed to be fully open world, there was supposed to be multiplayer, and the game itself was supposed to be released on Xbox 360 and PS3. If it weren't for those Russians :(. Postal 3 deserves a 4/10."

Bottom line the Postal series is a game set in a shared universe that is full of crude, immature shock comedy... and that isn't a bad thing. Frankly, I'm nostalgiaic over the first one. I played it a lot as a kid and at the time I took the whole thing as a big joke meant to offend people (which a great portion of it reall is just that), and my cousin played it, I shared it with all my friends back when I had the physical copy... It's the worlds wierdest ""kids"" game lol. BUT Postal 3 has horrible UI, hit detection, level design, has the worst graphics of a Source powered game that I've ever scene... Get Postal 2: Paradise Lost and the Workshop MODs. FUCK Postal III!"

11年的时候我下了三大妈毛子语音首发版，花了2天打完了善与恶两条路线
治好了我的压抑症
-----------------------------------------------------------
昨晚犯病了下了这个垃圾
没想到正版的毛病比盗版还要多
首先全屏的时候不能切屏，否则未响应
控制台不能impulse101因为会死机
进行任务时无故死机
玩了2小时的steam版总结就是
：[b]死机死机死机死机死机[/b]
-----------------------------------------------------------
先不谈死机，画质方面就现在来看还算可以的，毕竟07年的起源引擎
也就是说一直被称为神优化的引擎
在这个游戏上就是优化个P
敌人开枪你卡顿，跑步也卡顿，打死一个人的时候也卡顿，尸体一多固定10帧
这叫优化
-----------------------------------------------------------
这幻灯片的帧数吧也没啥，习惯习惯也就好了吧
但是这过场动画的npc面部表情就跟死了妈一样，一动不动然后加几段话
过场动画的画质甚至还没游戏本身的画质好的游戏
-----------------------------------------------------------
过场动画都这样了
可以想象出游戏内的ai会是啥样了
对
全是傻逼了
毫无ai，比如某些时候敌人看你就跟看稀有物种一样
其实就是引导你去无脑杀杀杀
-----------------------------------------------------------
ai都是智障了就可以无脑杀？
你忘了幻灯片一样的帧数
所以想发泄的爽一点的话
必须控制台god giveall giveallammo
不然你就是活该被杀
-----------------------------------------------------------
游戏都这么差了那么配乐呢
个人认为只有主菜单的音乐最带感
其他的话不做评价
音效方面大部分都是hl2里面的素材。是够懒的
-----------------------------------------------------------
读取方面也是遗传下来的，一个场景读一次，这点没啥要喷的
还有啥能喷的呢
就是[b]Akella[/b]
RWS做的游戏再怎么差也不会差成这种弱智样
2代和3代相隔了8年之久，能做成这样
只有Akella了，也就是Akella是外包的

现在只能期待RWS的postal：redux了

第100个评测，选择这样一个垃圾的玩的非常透的游戏也是值了
但是我的抑郁症还是没治好啊。。。","[h1]I fucked a cat, then got shot for no apparent reason, and then the whole city was slaughtered.[/h1]
Postal 2 called it a classic, and I've been looking forward to Postal 3 ever since.
In 2011, I downloaded the first version with the ""Three Aunts"" voiceover and finished both the good and evil routes in two days.
It cured my depression.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Last night, I got sick and downloaded this garbage.
I didn't expect the legitimate version to have more problems than the pirated version.
First, you can't switch screens in full screen, otherwise it becomes unresponsive.
You can't use Impulse 101 on the console because it freezes.
It freezes for no reason during missions.
After playing the Steam version for two hours, my summary is:
[b]Crash, crash, crash, crash.[/b]
-----------------------------------------------------------
Putting the crashes aside, the graphics quality is pretty good right now. After all, the 2007 Origin engine, which is always considered a highly optimized engine,... It's just optimization.
You get stuck when enemies shoot, when you run, and when you kill someone. It's a constant 10 FPS when there are too many corpses.
That's called optimization.
----------------------------------------------------------
The frame rate of this slideshow isn't a big deal; you'll get used to it.
But the facial expressions of the NPCs in the cutscenes are like they just lost their mother. They're frozen, and then there's a few lines of text.
The cutscenes aren't even as good as the game itself.
----------------------------------------------------------
With cutscenes like this, you can imagine what the in-game AI will be like. Yeah. It's all just idiotic. There's no AI at all. For example, sometimes enemies look at you like you're a rare species. It's basically just mindlessly guiding you to kill.
----------------------------------------------------------
If the AI ​​is completely retarded, can you just mindlessly kill? You forgot the slideshow-like framerate.
So if you want to vent a little, you have to use the console. ""God giveall giveallammo"" (likely a game or game title). Otherwise, you deserve to be killed.
-----------------------------------------------------------
The game is so bad, so what about the soundtrack? I personally think the main menu music is the most engaging. I won't comment on anything else.
The sound effects are mostly from Heroes II. So lazy.
-----------------------------------------------------------
The loading system is also inherited, loading each scene once. There's nothing much to criticize about that.
What else can I criticize? It's [b]Akella[/b]
No matter how bad RWS games are, they can't be this idiotic. There were eight years between the second and third games. Only Akella could achieve this. So, Akella was outsourced.

Now I can only look forward to RWS's postal: redux.

This is my 100th review, and it's worth choosing such a crappy game that I played through thoroughly.
But my depression still hasn't been cured..."

-Rotten story, what was Postal 1 and 2 is now ""politically correct"", but you choose to try to be on both sides (good and evil)
-Even with the Source Engine, there are several bugs
-Freedom? It's up your ass, the city map is fully unlocked when you beat the game, and you can enter almost anywhere in the game, but only after you beat it is when you get fed up with the game
-Why the fuck do fat people fall to the ground like paper? -Does this story make sense? I preferred it when Postal Dude went out on the street killing everyone, or when he was trying to live his normal life and a lot of shit happened and he had to kill everyone, I don't even know what kind of bad weed these guys smoked to make the story. And damn, what a hell having to side with good. You have to use that shitty, annoying stun gun that's not even thrilling to use. I'd rather side with the bad guys anyway.
- In Postal 2, it was perfect (not so much). You were arrested and could make a scheme to escape prison. You could disguise yourself as a cop. There was that outfit that showed your ass and you looked like... I don't know what the fuck that was. You only wore that because of the gloves. There were scenarios to explore and MODS, but not here. You just have to continue with the boring story and pick up weapons as you go along, and you can't wear any fucking clothes.
- There were several scenarios to explore (again, saying that) in Postal 2, and the map expanded as you progressed. My favorite stage was that circus or whatever, where your mother... I mean, an elephant was chasing you.
- Seriously, this game was developed by the same company that created Postal 2? Like Seriously, man?

Игру можно брать для ачивок и выполнять их по приколу и только тем,кого не волнуют баги игры и остальные её грехи коих можно очень много.Вполне возможно,кому-то понравиться черный юмор в игре и вполне не исключено,что вам могут понравиться некоторые трэки из игры.

-Игра провалилась и получила негативные оценки как от отечественных, так и от зарубежных сайтов, причём провал был настолько огромен, что RWS даже отменили версии игры для Playstation 3, Xbox 360 и Mac, и даже назвали игру спин-оффом и неканоничной.
-В Steam-версии Postal 2 есть пасхальное яйцо - в кустах на свалке можно найти копию Postal III и помочиться на нее, за что дают достижение.
-тема Postal III затрагивается в каноничной замене Postal III — дополнении для Postal 2, Paradise Lost, в котором Чувак, в самом начале, попадает в автокатастрофу, из-за чего впадает в кому на 11 лет и видит ""темное будущее"" в виде Postal III
-Ощущение, что игру делала группа школьников, увлекающихся программированием, не отпускает до самого конца

-Аризонцы из RWS, заметив реакции игроков, и получив тысячи гневных писем, боясь за свою репутацию, решают все-таки опробовать финальный продукт и теряют дар речи. Увидев детище отечественных разработчиков под своим брендом, они требуют Акеллу отдать права на Postal 3 чтобы переделать его и продолжить выпускать патчи, ибо внимание фанатов им важнее, чем Акелле. Но боссы Акеллы не просто не хотят отдавать права на третью часть, но и претендуют получить все права на серию себе, и клепать «Postal VS Мухтар», «Штопор ЖЖот 2» и Postal 4 и получать с этого нехилые деньги, а то, что сама серия скатится при этом в говно — им пох.., ведь русский бизнес такой русский, и бабло можно подымать на мегаговенных играх по мегаговенному кинцу (тот же «Бой с тенью», например). Офигевшие от такого рассклада RWS показали хер Акелле, высказав на заявлении вот это:

Пусть Акелла отсосет у нас, если ей так хочется права на Postal, пусть направляется прямиком в суд!!!

На данный момент TrashMasters была закрыта, и дальнейшая разработка патчей и других игр приостановлена навсегда. Сайт игры был также закрыт, а русское сообщество фанатов перебралось на западные форумы. Война между RWS и Акеллой уже закончилась - Postal 3 признан неканоничным, а все связи с Акеллой разорваны.

— What is Russian business? — Steal a case of vodka, sell the vodka, and drink the money away.

Quotes from Wikipedia and Lurk:

-Many of the developers' promises were never fulfilled.
-The game was a flop and received negative reviews from both domestic and international sites. The failure was so severe that RWS even canceled the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Mac versions of the game, and even called the game a spin-off and non-canon.
-The Steam version of Postal 2 contains an Easter egg: you can find a copy of Postal III in the bushes at the junkyard and urinate on it, which awards an achievement.
- The theme of Postal III is touched upon in the canonical Postal III replacement, the Postal 2 expansion Paradise Lost, in which the Dude, at the very beginning, gets into a car accident, which causes him to fall into a coma for 11 years and sees a ""dark future"" in the form of Postal III.
- The feeling that the game was made by a group of schoolchildren with a passion for programming lingers until the very end.

- The Arizonans from RWS, noticing player reactions and receiving thousands of angry emails, fearing for their reputation, decide to try out the final product and are speechless. Seeing the brainchild of domestic developers under their own brand, they demand that Akella hand over the rights to Postal 3 so they can remake it and continue releasing patches, as the fans' attention is more important to them than to Akella. But Akella's bosses not only don't want to hand over the rights to the third game, they're also claiming all the rights to the series for themselves, churning out ""Postal vs. Mukhtar,"" ""Shtopor ZHZhot 2,"" and Postal 4, and making a tidy profit from them. They couldn't care less that the series itself would deteriorate into crap, after all, Russian business is Russian, and money can be made from mega-crap games based on mega-crap movies (like ""Shadowboxing,"" for example). RWS, stunned by this scenario, gave Akella the cold shoulder, saying this in a statement:

Let Akella suck our dick if she wants the rights to Postal so badly; let her head straight to court!!!

At this point, TrashMasters has been shut down, and further development of patches and other games has been permanently suspended. The game's website has also been shut down, and the Russian fan community has migrated to Western forums. The war between RWS and Akella is over – Postal 3 has been declared non-canon, and all ties with Akella have been severed.

儘管《Postal 3》選用Valve公司研發的Source引擎（利用此引擎製作的著名作品有Half-Life 2、DOTA 2和Counter-Strike: Global Offensive），遊戲本身優化還是異常糟糕，當畫面出現三名以上非玩家角色時，每秒幀數就會明顯下跌，人物死亡噴濺出的屍塊容易造成畫面停頓，電腦像是被大陸間諜軟體攻擊一樣，發出痛苦不堪的慘叫，不禁懷疑開發團隊是否沒有先行測試，又或者連優化運行的步驟都省了，玩到硬體燒毀的玩家都活該受罪？聽說不管多好的電腦配備都無法順暢運行這款雷作，就算畫面品質調到最低也於事無補。


遊戲性非常差勁，基本上筆者不會對惡搞取向的作品認真，但是這款遊戲根本就是把玩家當白癡耍，不僅拋棄前作令人津津樂道的自由探索特性，還將關卡內容改為線性玩法，一本道一路走到底，完全沒有自由度可言，玩家在遊戲中接獲的任務也大同小異，通常就是幹掉一夥人或是護送目標，毫無變化性的任務讓人容易厭倦。除此之外，更可怕的就是遊戲錯誤無所不在，任務道具消失、護送目標卡位、無法觸發劇情開啟房門、程式死當、畫面破圖、存檔遺失，Ｍetacritic給予本作二十四分完全是意料之內的情況。


總而言之，《Postal 3》是無可救藥的地雷遊戲，不單只是遊戲本身內容欠佳，就連最基本的優化與除蟲都沒有做好，拔掉自由探索的特色立馬成為毫無亮點可言的劣質作品，整體呈現出的品質不僅無法跟其他相同性質的遊戲相比，就連市面上多數的獨立遊戲都能輕鬆擊敗本作，即便在畫面表現上遠勝過於十二年前發售的二代，但遊戲性可以說是相差十萬八千里，三代根本看不到二代的車尾燈。筆者無法推薦這款遊戲給所有《Postal》系列的愛好者，除非你也想體驗蛋疼菊緊的感受，要不然千萬不要購買本作。


優點：
+找不到任何優點，痛苦太多收獲太少，珍惜生命遠離此作。


缺點：
-優化差勁，畫面出現的人數一多，就會造成每秒幀數下跌。
-錯誤多到不行，沒有經過除錯作業就不負責任的發行遊戲。
-糟蹋Source引擎的米田共，Gabe Newell激怒不可避。


結論：建議你省下一天的生活費，買罐啤酒和雞肉串享受人生吧！

","Postal 3 is a third-person shooter released in 2011. Because the third installment wasn't developed by the original team, Running With Scissors, but rather licensed to the little-known Russian studio Trashmasters, the game's quality was shoddy, making it a dark spot in the Postal series' history. When discussing Postal, one must mention its success. Touted as even more violent and gory than Grand Thief Auto, the game was banned in over 20 countries worldwide (including Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, China, and Japan). As the saying goes, ""where there's a demand, there's a market,"" and while brutal violence is a common selling point, Postal 3 unfortunately fails to deliver the pure thrill of carnage. Numerous bugs, awkward body movements, unfunny jokes, and a focus on story-driven gameplay rather than free exploration all contributed to its failure.

Despite using Valve's Source engine (the same engine used to power such renowned titles as Half-Life 2, DOTA 2, and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive), Postal 3's optimization remains exceptionally poor. The frame rate drops significantly when three or more non-player characters are present, and the splattering of corpses upon death often causes screen freezes. Computers scream in agony, as if attacked by mainland Chinese spyware. I can't help but wonder if the development team didn't test the game beforehand, or perhaps even skipped the optimization steps. Players who end up burning out their hardware deserve the consequences. I've heard that even the best computers can't run this dreadful game smoothly, even at the lowest graphics settings.

The gameplay is abysmal. I generally don't take parody-oriented titles seriously, but this one simply treats players like idiots. Not only does it abandon the free exploration that made the previous game so popular, but it also shifts the levels to a linear, one-track path with absolutely no freedom. The missions offered are also largely the same, usually just killing a group of people or escorting a target. This lack of variety makes it easy to get bored. Even more frightening is the omnipresence of game bugs: quest items disappear, targets get stuck, doors can't be opened to trigger plots, the program crashes, the screen is broken, and save files are lost. It's no surprise that Metacritic gave this game a 24.

In short, ""Postal 3"" is a hopelessly poor game. Not only does the game itself lack content, but even basic optimization and bug fixes are missing. Without the free exploration feature, it becomes a shoddy game with no real highlights. Its overall quality not only fails to compare to other games of the same genre, but even most independent games on the market easily outperform it. While its graphics far surpass those of the original Postal 2, released twelve years ago, the gameplay is a world apart; Postal 3 can't even begin to compare to the original. I can't recommend this game to any fans of the ""Postal"" series. Unless you're looking for a painful, butt-wrenching experience, don't buy it.

Pros:
+ I can't find any positives. Too much pain for too little gain. Avoid this game if you're lucky.

Cons:
- Poor optimization. The frame rate drops when too many people are on screen.
- Excessively buggy. It's irresponsible to release this game without debugging. -Yoneta Ko, who trashed the Source engine, inevitably drew the wrath of Gabe Newell.

Conclusion: I suggest you save a day's living expenses, buy a beer and some chicken skewers, and enjoy life!

[*][b]Mavrodi[/b] - Yeah, they added this clown to the game to promote his new scam, ""MMM-2012."" Maybe I'm exaggerating, but I don't see any other reason. Remember the 90s, when Mavrodi screwed half of Russia? It could happen again, after all, a sucker isn't a mammoth.
[*][b]Crap weapon[/b] - Don't even think about using anything other than a firearm. While you're aiming a pointer, hoping Champ will bite off your enemy's balls, you'll already be sliced ​​up.

Продолжение легендарой, шикарной и лучшей игры Postal 2. В свое время вторая часть навела шума, много пошлости, крови, насилия, жестокости, высмеивания различных культур, черного юмора, пахабные высказывания Чувака, расчленение во всей красе и безграничные способы убийства. Postal 2 - считался эталоном среди игр в открытом мире и от первого лица. 

Далекий 2003 год. Состоялся выход игры Постал 2, где мы, в шкуре некого чувака, выполняем различные задания, тем самым проживая очередной день в Богом забытом месте, городе Парадиз(Рай, иронично то как). В нашем распоряжение открытый мир, множество оружия, полезных предметов, полная свобода действий, вас никто не принуждает стоят в очереди за молоком, укради и беги, или стой и терпи тупых и медлительных покупателей перед тобой. Разнообразные задания радовали каждый раз (подписи для разрешения жестоких игр, помочиться на могилу отца, исповедаться, купить мясо, оплатить штрафы и получить посылку, и т.д). Ты был волен гулять и убивать, бегать от ментов, или же устраивать побег из тюрьмы, НО это обзор не для второй части, а для третьей

POSTAL изменился!!! Новый город, новый вид, новый голос. Юмор все также на высоте, высказывания Чувака цитируются игроками. В глазах малолетних геймеров, замкнутых мизатропов, социопатов и людей с расстройством психики - он герой, кумир, образ для подражания(и я был в их числе, выбирай любое). Суть игры не изменилась спустя 10 лет(в 2013 вышла). Ты безбашеный Чувак, умеющий таскать с собой тьму оружия, убивать все что движиться и быть безнаказанным. Иди по пути добра или зла, или будь полным мудаком, кроши всех направо и налево, даже тех, кто временно твой союзник. 

Плюсы:
- Вид от третьего лица, теперь видно чувака, как и в чем одет, ведет себя, кровь на лице, когда в тебя херачат с пулемета
- Выбор оружия стал куда удобней, теперь для каждой единицы оружия, своя клавиша, скажите ""глупо"", ваше право, конечно было бы удобнее селекция оружия, ака Ассасинс крид братсво, или в Saints row third, но и так классно.
- Много нового оружия: Лазерная указка Чампа, Бешеный-Барсук, похотливая обезьяна, пчелиная граната, Пулемет M-60, пожарный топор, шокер и это только то, что я вспомнил
- Есть разветление в сюжете, классно. Можно быть добрым или злым, выбрав один путь, и играя до конца, вы увидете совсем другую развязку, миссии, способы прохода. В игре есть 3 концовки, но сам я сталкивался с двумя. Ах да, выбрав манеру своего поведения, не означает, что это навсегда, меняйся на ходу, надоело быть добрым? Убевай всех, стань на путь безумия, и наоборот.
- Сюжет средний, но играть приятно, смотря кат-сцены в озвучке Куража, кто знает, тот поймет.
- Удобная стрельба, используй прикрытия, пали в головы приближая прицел, метать гранаты стало лучше(прицелился, выбрал траекторию, метнул, или положил как мину)
- Какой, никакой, но транспорт, Сигвей, будет возможность покататься по городу на двухколесном, а не двуногом
- Бег! Можно совершить рывок, опракидывая врагов, соперников, прохожих на лопатки, и расстрелять при случае.
- Юмор! множество отсылок, Осама, Сергей Пантелеевич(Мы Можем Многое), Postal Babes и другие. 

Пока все что вспомнил, пока играю

Минусы(куда уж без них):
- Кривое управление при пользование ближним оружием(Барсуку пох)
- Чувак разучился прыгать и присидать, а тут так не хватает этого, в маневрах и боях 
- Плохая анимация пинка, лучше бы отталкивание сделали бы, которое есть, когда враг слишком близко
- Мачете-бумеранг стало УГ оружием, уже не так как раньше, присел, ноги отрубил, и смотришь как тот мучается и уползает
- Были вылеты, без причин и следствий, а также иногда тормозит игра в начале после кат-сцены
- Здоровье, теперь регенится, всегда это бесило.
- Исключили полезные предметы(локатор, хавку, деньги, трубку здоровья, броня и прочее из второй части)

Пока все что вспомнил и увидел,

Но все же игра найдет своего игрока, фаната или ненавистника, но когда это ПОсталу было ни насрать на все это?

Будь своден и взбешен, убивай и наслаждайся, ведь где кроме как Постала ты сможешь это сделать(вопрос чисто риторический)

10 Чуваков с Чампом из 10","Postal III

A sequel to the legendary, brilliant, and best game, Postal 2. The second game caused a stir in its day, featuring vulgarity, blood, violence, cruelty, mockery of various cultures, dark humor, the Dude's raunchy remarks, dismemberment in all its glory, and endless ways to kill. Postal 2 was considered the benchmark among open-world, first-person games.

It's back in 2003. Postal 2 was released, where we, in the shoes of a certain Dude, complete various tasks, living out another day in a godforsaken place, the city of Paradise (ironically, Paradise). We have an open world, a multitude of weapons, useful items, and complete freedom of action. No one forces you to stand in line for milk, steal and run, or stand and endure the slow and stupid shoppers in front of you. The varied missions were always a joy (signing for permission to play violent games, urinating on your father's grave, confessing, buying meat, paying fines and receiving packages, etc.). You were free to roam and kill, run from the cops, or even escape from prison, BUT this review is for the third game, not the second.

POSTAL has changed!!! New city, new look, new voice. The humor is still top-notch, and the Dude's quotes are quoted by players. In the eyes of underage gamers, withdrawn misanthropes, sociopaths, and people with mental disorders, he's a hero, an idol, a role model (and I was one of them, take your pick). The core of the game hasn't changed 10 years later (it was released in 2013). You're the reckless Dude, capable of carrying a ton of weapons, killing anything that moves, and getting away with it. Follow the path of good or evil, or be a complete asshole, slaughtering everyone left and right, even those who are temporarily your allies.

Pros:
- Third-person view, now you can see the guy, what he's wearing, how he acts, the blood on his face when he's being hit with a machine gun.
- Weapon selection has become much more convenient, each weapon now has its own key. Say ""stupid,"" and you're right. Of course, a weapon selection system, like in Assassin's Creed Brotherhood or Saints Row III, would be more convenient, but it's still cool.
- Lots of new weapons: Champa's Laser Pointer, Mad Badger, Horny Monkey, Bee Grenade, M-60 Machine Gun, Fire Axe, Taser, and those are just the ones I remembered.
- There are branching plot points, which is cool. You can be good or evil; choose one path, and by playing to the end, you'll see a completely different outcome, missions, and paths. The game has three endings, but I personally experienced two. Oh yeah, choosing your behavior doesn't mean it's forever. Change as you go. Tired of being good? Kill everyone, embrace madness, and vice versa.
- The story is average, but the game is enjoyable, watching the cutscenes voiced by Courage; those who know will understand.
- Convenient shooting: use cover, aim for heads by zooming in on them, throwing grenades has become better (aim, choose a trajectory, throw, or lay them like a mine).
- Some kind of transport, a Segway, but you'll have the opportunity to ride around the city on two wheels instead of two legs.
- Run! You can dash, knocking enemies, rivals, and passersby to their knees, and shoot them when the opportunity arises.
- Humor! Lots of references, Osama, Sergey Panteleevich (We Can Do Much), Postal Babes, and others.

So far, that's all I can remember while playing.

Cons (of course, they're a must-have):
- Poor controls when using melee weapons (Badger doesn't care)
- Dude forgot how to jump and crouch, and this game really needs it, in maneuvers and fights.
- Bad kick animation; they'd be better off with a knockback, which is present when an enemy is too close.
- The machete-boomerang has become a terrible weapon, not like before: you crouch, chop off their legs, and watch them suffer and crawl away.
- There were crashes, for no apparent reason, and the game sometimes lags at the beginning after a cutscene.
- Health now regenerates, which always annoyed me. - Useful items (locator, food, money, health bar, armor, and other items from the second part) were removed.

So far, that's all I can remember and see.

But the game will still find its players, fans, and haters alike. But when did Postal ever give a shit about all that?

Be mad and enraged, kill and enjoy, because where else but Postal can you do that? (Purely rhetorical question.)

19292187,russian,2015.10.26 23:12,❌,✅,0.5,0,"Postal 2 - это возможность устроить резню без повода и если вы пали на такой соблазн, то игра предлагала вам разрные варианты расчлененки и в неком роде пощряла ваши геноцидные наклонности.

Postal 3 - это борьба с соблазнами, такое ощущение, что её выпустили люди недалекие от церкви, ибо убивать нельзя. В одной из миссий(2-ой вроде) вам вообще запрещено стрелять, а если вы выстрелите, то все, 10 минут жизни потрачены и придется проходить заного. Что бы было проще понять о чем я, представьте, что в NFS Underground 2 запрещено было бы ездить со скоростью выше 60 км\ч и нарушать правила ПДД, при том, что предыдущая часть вообще не заморачивалась на эти моменты.

Тут есть такой момент, что идет разветвление сюжета и каждый приходит к своем завершению. Я решил пройти игру так, как она хочет этого от меня, т.е. никого не убивая(т.е. за мента), по сути были миссии где надо устраивать геноцид, но вот что меня огорчило, так это то, что в конце этого сюжета сразу начинается другой, за плохиша так сказать и ладно если бы это было продолжение, но нет, это именно перезапуск игры, все сюжетные персонажи которых вы убили вдруг опять раздают вам задания и идут те же задания которые были за мента, но только под другим углом( даже оружие сохраняют ).

Я эту игру не рекомендую только из-за этого момента, а так, если! пройти N% игры, то будет изобилие миссий где надо устроить резню.","Postal 2 is an opportunity to commit massacre without provocation, and if you succumbed to such temptation, the game offered you various options for dismemberment, somewhat encouraging your genocidal tendencies.

Postal 3 is a struggle against temptations; it feels like it was made by people with little religious affiliation, because killing is forbidden. In one mission (I think it was the second), you're forbidden from shooting at all, and if you shoot, that's it, 10 minutes of your life are lost and you have to start over. To make it easier to understand what I mean, imagine if NFS Underground 2 forbade driving over 60 km/h and breaking traffic rules, even though the previous game didn't bother with these issues at all.

There's a branching plot here, and everyone reaches their own conclusion. I decided to play the game the way it wanted me to, i.e., Without killing anyone (i.e., playing as a cop), there were essentially missions where you had to commit genocide. But what upset me was that at the end of this storyline, another one immediately begins, playing for the bad guy, so to speak. It would be fine if it were a continuation, but no, it's a complete restart of the game. All the characters you killed suddenly give you missions again, and you get the same missions you had as a cop, but from a different perspective (you even keep your weapons).

I don't recommend this game just because of this point, but if you complete N% of the game, there will be plenty of missions where you have to commit massacre."

Node graph errors occur every time you play this game, and you will always expect some sort of graphical issue when playing this title. Akella has ruined the macabre concept of the Postal Dude, getting a new voice actor, and removing jumping and replacing it with a faulty cover system.

Hell, the only way to have fun in this game is heavily mod it. The only realistic model in this game is of Postal Dude, with every single civilian appearing to be a cartoon character from a Disney film. Commanding Champ to take out enemies just straight up doesn't work, you are better off using the helper monkey which appears literally once in the game. The third person view is not that bad, but then you realize Akella probably did that to make the Postal series more like a GTA clone. 

The whole good/bad paths in the game do not mean anything. In a game where you can amputate a mans arm, throw it at another person, all while urinating on them, the game punishes you severely for doing anything close to bad. And if you select the good path, the game is no fun, whatsoever. Nobody confronts you (except Osama Bin Laden) and because the game is on rails, being wanted by the police means nothing. There isn't even a system that allows you to know you are wanted, you just do soemthing, and every single officer unloads on you. To make that worse, you can't evade them until you die.

The high note in this game is the weapons. I mean, a badger on a stick that you can have maul people to death, it's crazy. Krotchy doll nukes, the shop-vac, all were great ideas, but had a very poor execution.

The demo shown in 2007 had better graphics, gameplay, and overall feel than this game.
At best, this is something a college student would make in Unity3D. 3.5/10

-Voiceover: Whilst Rick Hunter was unavailable during development, we got Cory Cruise as The POSTAL Dude this time around, who did an excellent job.
-Environments: Most of the textures and modelling make the environment feel closer to home with real life at times.

Well, there are more cons unfortunately...

-CTD: This game uses an older, more unstable version of the Source engine, and many of the game's features can crash the game for seemingly no reason at seemingly anytime. this includes grenades (maybe even all throwable weapons), fire (from what I've experienced), gibbing, and simply too much chaos.
-Missing Content: The game has some content missing from it such as certain sounds not playing correctly, broken scripts, and even a level monologue. the level of scripts missing is staggering, yet is simply disabled in the source code rather than not present at all.
-Issues: Ever wonder why some of the achievements don't trigger? that's because of some issues in the game's code. ever wonder why the kick along with most melee weapons are practically useless? issues in the code causing them to be aimed downward rather than forward. I could go over them all, but I don't have enough time for that.

All in all, POSTAL III was a flawed entry that left a bad taste in my mouth. now, there are many sources that could tell you all about the ""where did it go wrong?"" part of development, but all in all, I recommend you get POSTAL 2 or POSTAL 4: No Regerts instead. if you insist on grabbing this box of pink crap, I suggest grabbing a few improvement mods first. hope I helped.","Hoo boy, this one is comparable to Duke Nukem Forever in disappointment.

Annak ellenére, hogy a virágbolti verzióval már jóval a vásárlás előtt futottam egy kört, voltam olyan elvakult, hogy 10 euróért bezsebeljem ezt a csodát is.

A tény az, hogy a Postal 3 alapból nem lenne rossz. Van benne potenciál, a jó/rossz oldal közötti választás is igazán ígéretesnek hangzik, és az az egyedi, beteges humora és hangulata is megmaradt, ami a sorozatot jellemzi. Egyszerűen csak túl gagyi az egész. A megjelenés elnagyolt, a már-már meseszerű figurák valahogy nem illenek bele ebbe a világba. Értem én, hogy karikatúrák akarnának lenni.... egyszerűen csak nem működik. Ez viszont a kisebb gond, mert efelett szemet is tudnék hunyni. A játék gyakorlatilag még most is (a megjelenés időpontját számítva) félkésznek tűnik, hiába dolgoztak rajta 5 éven át. Egyes játékelemek nem működnek és bugos, mint a szar.

[b]es el año 2008[/b], pasa uno de los eventos más importantes del mundo la [url=https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_financiera_de_2008]crisis financiera[/url] Akella se queda sin dinero y no le queda otra opción que despedir al grupo de desarrolladores, el proyecto pasa al grupo B, después despiden al grupo C, y así sucesivamente, el juego tenía planeado lanzarse en [b]2008-2009[/b] sufrió varios retrasos hasta que akella se quedó sin dinero en 2011, se quedó sin dinero y el juego se lanzó en ese mismo año como un último intento de Akella de generar ingresos.

[h1]No es tan malo como ustedes creen... ¿O si?[/h1]

Bueno en esta entrega controlamos a [b]Postal Dude [/b] otravez después de los eventos de [b][I]Postal 2:Apocalypse Weekend [/I][/b] , la mecánica y la idea son las mismas pero hay que tomar en cuenta un punto muy importante, [b]Postal 2 corría en Unreal engine 2[/b] que si esta algo anticuado para los tiempos que corren daba la posibilidad de dar la sensación de mundo abierto, punto fuerte para que fuera un éxito, [b]Postal 3 corre en Source[/b] Motor gráfico en cual corren juegos como [b]Half-Life 2 y Left 4 Dead[/b] ambos juegos lineales, esta no es la excepción, si bien los escenarios son más detallados que en el 2, son más pequeños que en Paradise.

[h1]Un juego Lineal, con sistema de Karma[/h1]

Llegamos a una ciudad llamada [b]Catharsis[/b], ciudad en la cual llega en búsqueda de Gas, dinero y poco después a Champ, la historia es floja, sólo te dejan un par de misiones con objetivos muy específicos con [b] una inteligencia bastante floja[/B], durante el trayecto hay un [b]sistema de karma[/b] que influirá mucho en el juego, bueno realmente muy poco, solo son las mismas misiones con un par de cambios aquí y allá, nada relevante, en el juego hay 2 caminos, [b]el camino bueno y el camino loco[/B], algo que no tiene lógica viniendo de un juego donde puedes tomar un camino u otro no influía o no tenías persecuciónes, (o muy pocas).
El camino que tomes influirá al final del juego ya que dependiendo te que camino tomes será el final que te toque.

[h1]Gears of Postal[/h1]

La jugabilidad del juego es algo tosca y poco responsiva, [b] la mirilla del juego aveces parece estar de adorno[/B], el modo de apuntar es estándar, la manera de correr y cubrirse esta calcada de [b]Gears of War[/b], es literal el mismo movimiento solo que ejecutado en un juego Source, ¿que rayos estaban pensando? Y ¿porque?, a igual que en Gears of War, en este juego [b]no se puede saltar independientemente[/B], algo que limita, bastante la exploración, algo que en la entrega pasada se te recompensaba bastante.

[h1]Un catálogo de armas algo peculiar[/h1]

Las armas en Postal 3 [b]se controlan poco y tienen poco poder[/B] con algunas excepciones, la M16 y la Sierra Tejon son de lo mejor la última muy disfrutable pero en varias misiones le sufres bastante porque los enemigos traen armas en una pelea de puños, y hablando de los puños...
[b]Dios mio con el combate cuerpo a cuerpo[/b], da pena, no responde como debe, es aburrido, y no se disfruta del nada. Simplemente no funciona, no puedo creer que sean tan Incompetentes de implementarlo como se debe.

[h1]Postal III: The Aftermath[/h1]

Empeze hablando sobre el desarrollo del juego porque muchos creen que Postal 3 es odiado por sus propios dueños, este no es el caso, [b]Vince Desi[/b] dijo en un [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlLr8e-QESY&index=2&list=PLzm2jHdsIATtuSXV4WbyFz3kY1wfRKJzc&t=1009s&ab_channel=RunningWithScissors]podcast[/url] de Junio del 2016 que tienen el código, el detalle es que esta todo en ruso y el está dispuesto arreglar el juego si hay bastantes personas que dominen el idioma y colaboren para arreglarlo, todo esto quedó en que era posible, siempre cuando se cuente con el apoyo suficiente.

[h1] ¿Que paso con Rick Hunter?[/h1]

[b]Rick Hunter[/b] es la voz original de los 2 primeros juegos del Postal Dudé, en este juego no lo incluyeron por motivos personales, en ese caso invitaron a [b]Cory Cruise[/b], para hacerles honestos su trabajo me encantó y para mi será el segundo Postal Dude.

[H1]Conclusión[/h1]

[b]Postal 3[/b], fue una mala decisión de RWS, dejando el desarrollo, a manos de una empresa Rusa a la que e oído era el equivalente de [b] Electronic Arts[/b] en Rusia, en mi opinión no creo que sea el peor videojuego del mundo si no sólo una mala decisión de una empresa, años después RWS Lanzaría [b]Postal 2: Paradise Lost[/b] como una forma de decir perdón a los fans que estaban tan ilusionados por este proyecto, ahora RWS apostó por Unreal Engine 4 y Lanzó Postal 4: No Regerts Como acceso anticipado en Steam con las mismas ideas y con la misma mecánica del 2, la verdadera secuela que debío haber existido.",

Спонсируемые Акеллой разработчики запороли всё, пили литрами пиво, и только по понедельникам с бодуна садились делать игру. Решив стремительно распилить бабло, запили на Source (лаги, вылеты, отсутствие поддержки, и всё это на хорошем движке). Русская озвучка выполнена студией Кураж-Бамбей. Высказывания типа «Во всём виноват христианский метал» или «А в ГТА физика лучше!» доставляют. 
Тупые как пробки враги наскакивают со всех сторон, пугают дерганой анимацией, получают в ответ автоматную очередь и драпают, теряя по дороге конечности. В третьей части таки появилась «расчлененка», но картонные «детали» тел, летающие по немыслимым траекториям, впечатлят разве что пятилетнего ребенка. При попытке пальнуть из-за угла садистски настроенная камера утыкается Чуваку в затылок. И это — верхушка айсберга! Ощущение, что игру делала группа школьников, увлекающихся программированием, не отпускает до самого конца. 
В результате получилось что-то невнятное, но явно хуже второй части.  Почувствовав боль в заднем отверстии, боссы RWS заметив реакции игроков, решили вернуть обратно свой бренд, и были посланы в это же отверстие, из которой и вылезла это игра (Ждём Postal VS Мухтар).",

That said, I thought it was very entertaining. When it comes to Postal III, I'm at a loss for words. I'd prefer to write a positive review, describing in detail on how this game improved on its predecessor. If necessary, I could write a negative review, filled to the brim with reasons as to why I believe this product to be a disappointing sequel. Instead, I'm staring into the abyss.

The Postal Dude is at it again. After blazing a trail of death and destruction through the town of Paradise, he finds himself in Catharsis. Madcap mayhem and wacky hijinks await as Postal Dude tries to find a paying job. Will you somehow find the light of virtue within yourself? Or will you once again submit to your demons, using murder to solve every minor dilemna? Whatever the case, you're sure to be in for a great time. This game also stars Ron Jeremy and Jennifer Walcott. I'm surprised that Lloyd Kaufman didn't make an appearance as well.

This entry uses a morality system. Unfortunately, this doesn't mean The Postal Dude will be helping old ladies cross the street (or into woodchippers). Basically, if you want to be the good guy, you have to abide by the law. Naturally, this requires that you become a police officer, and make the law your own. While this doesn't give you a free pass to endanger innocent lives, at least you're doing your part to make Catharsis a safer(?) place. If that sounds like too much trouble, you can always be evil incarnate. This will result in different levels, and eventually a bad ending, if you don't change your ways. If eternal damnation doesn't appeal to you, there's always the handy taser gun. Non-lethal takedowns slowly add up, allowing you another opportunity to join the force when you complete the level. Unfortunately, the possibility exists that your morality, will be at the mercy of the game itself.

While I applaud the writers for their attempt at injecting more story into the Postal saga, things stop making sense very early on. I suppose this can be attributed to the fact that I had to skip stages in order to progress. Let me rephrase that: I had to cheat* just to complete this game. Aside from the high probability of crashes, there are numerous scripting issues. Some doors are scripted to open when an event occurs. For reasons that can surely be attributed to the troubled development of the game, these scripts frequently break. 

To give an example: Shortly after I joined the force, I was tasked with eliminating the homeless that were running rampant through the police station. Eventually I reached a point where a door was supposed to open, but it didn't. I could see the enemy's guns clipping through the door, but there was nothing I could do about it. I restarted the level, which fixed it. However, there was another door later on in the level, and it had the exact same issue. This happened again in another level, where I was supposed to go to the mall, the doors simply wouldn't open. 

Unlocking all of the stages in Postal III via cheats is a simple task, but that isn't the point. All that work I did trying to be a good Postal Dude? Gone. Putting difficulty aside, when a game can't be completed without resorting to cheats, that means it is broken.

Postal III tends to feel like busy-work. Most of the levels start off with an extremely boring job, which fits in with the story. After a short time, things get crazy when Soccer Moms or Savage Nerds or Eco-Terrorists or ???? show up. This is the point where you have to kill/subdue a certain number of them so that the level will end. Postal 2's strength wasn't in standard FPS mechanics. A lot of the entertainment came from using the sandbox aspects. It was a game designed around finding different solutions for everyday problems (sometimes without murder). With Postal III, almost the entirety of the product involves shooting, and it is very poorly-handled. The Postal Dude can take cover, but it's so ineffective you're sometimes better off standing out in the open. On the bright side, the enemy AI is so bad they're liable to ignore or even forget about you in the heat of combat. The levels that don't require the player to deal with x amount of enemies, tend to be really linear slogs. There are even escort missions, as if players wouldn't have enough reasons to hate this game. 

Aside from severe technical faults such as long load times and poor performance, Postal III also suffers from awful mechanics. Melee is basically useless. Even the heavier weapons, like the fire ax, don't work all that well. One of the items you acquire is a laser pointer, for leading Champ (your dog) to enemies. It is complete trash. The same can be said about most of Postal III's weapons. There's no real incentive to play with them, because they either don't work, or just aren't satisfying. Typically, the average Postal III play-through is going to revolve entirely around shooting everything. It gets old very quickly. Urinating is no longer infinite either. The Postal Dude can't piss as much as he wants, now he has to wait for his bladder to refill. Yes, it's probably an unnecessary thing to complain about, but it's still a nonsensical change that adds nothing to the game. Everything about Postal III is worse than its prequel...Everything**.

Some of you reading this review might not care about Postal. You might even think ""It's a garbage franchise anyway. Who cares?"" Well, it's just my opinion, but I liked the second game. It was crass, offensive, and sometimes the humor fell absolutely flat. Yet underneath all of the nastiness, there is still a game. Postal III is broken, and is more prone to cause headaches than provide any entertainment value. The multitude of bugs, scripting failures, and generally unfun game-design, make for a forgettable entry in this controversial series.

Из хорошего в ней:
 - музыка (по крайней мере по злому пути)
 - хедшоты
 - кураж-бомбей
 - свободный режим в целом такой, каким должен был получиться hatred (в геймплейном плане, а не техническом). А именно: никакого сопротивления, никакой полиции, просто бегай по городу и убивай безоружных людишек без всякого смысла и целей.

Из остального по геймплею совсем ничего примечательного. Не стоит тратить время.

По технической части как минимум: 
 - проблемы со звуком (частично решаются очисткой кеша через консоль).
 - фризы (мелкие подлагивания) на некоторых уровнях на топовом железе.
 - на некоторых уровнях повышен шанс словить креш.
В целом технически всё это смахивает на средненькую альфу.

Не рекомендую тратить на эту игру время (разве что в свободном режиме херней пострадать ачивки поделать). 

Вместо этого лучше перепройти еще раз Postal 2 и пройти новое дополнение к нему (2015 года) - Paradise Lost (в стиме есть полный набор). Дополнение отличное, в духе оригинального Postal 2, по геймплею и по доступности игровых локаций (не такое линейное и трешовое говно как apocalypse weekend).

It may take a while for you to get to the great Run N Gun action this game offers, but it's there.
Some of the eralier missions can be boring, but if you know what to do they'll fly by.
Hell, there's even an in depth choices to give you branching quest lines. I'd suggest dodging between them to get the maximum gameplay value. Twenty dollars is a little pricey for something the devs don't support anymore, but if you're open minded it's worth a try. 

Pretty original with it's wacky story, even if some of the humor falls flat. Such as over usage of the word retarded in the stupidest of ways. The duded may not be just like his old, asocial asexual self from the last game. but he's still pretty good. Now he's a white-trash meme loving dead beat with shitty luck. He's deffinetly more layed back and not much of a psycho.

The game has great music, even if it does end up looping a couple times in each level, but it's mostly one song for each level so it's pretty good. Oddly serious and good music on the tutorial, fairly surprising and uneeded.

The game is crappy yet incredibly fun, and it know it. Almost has a saints row 3 feel, with how it doesn't take itself seriously. It has a lower-class outsider dark humor to it, which works in its favor. Honnestly, as a white-trash dead beat I find the postal dude relateable for the most part, with how he's scorned by everyone and's always an outsider.

Over all, the game is a 7/10. Not a huge winner, but it's pretty dang original.

Also, I became god of the tabby-cats. By the end of the game, I had about thirty of them. This makes me very happy, considering I choose to save them all, hoping I could make them my army.

Many know this already, but for those who don't, Postal III is not the creation of Running With Scissors. It was licensed to Akella in hopes of developing a next generation Postal game, but thanks to the Russian recession Akella went bankrupt and all developmental work went to a fledgling ""b-team."" The results were catastrophic, as what was once intended to be an open ended and graphically impressive Postal became a bug-ridden mess. 

Although its price can never be justified even at 50% off, I will say that for those who already own it, two things about this game are decent. First is the free-roam feature that is unlocked after completing those horrid story missions. If you really can't stand playing through it, which few can, there are ways to bypass the missions that a simple Google search will yield. The free-roam itself is mediocre, as there are few things to do but walk around and slaughter a few civilians until the game crashes, but it's much more rewarding than the series of tutorials that constitute the main game.

The second feature worth mentioning was a joke that occurred... I'd say about halfway through the game, where the Alternative Postal Dude is approaching a building being held up by rather incompetent shooters. In the midst of the inaccurate bullet fest, a peacekeeper attempts to approach the building only to have his head blown off. The Postal Dude then exclaims, ""holy s***, did they level up?"" It made me laugh, anyways.

That's really all that's worth experiencing in Postal III. You're much better off paying a fraction of Postal III's price to own the real Postal games.","As a diehard fan of the real Postal games, it's very difficult for me to think of any redeeming qualities of Postal III.

Basically the game throws you into 3-4 minute load screens and that's not even the worst of it. Sure, you can run around and kill whoever and whatever you want, but the missions are all, and I mean every goddamn one, is a kill this many people or keep this many protesters at bay. There's nothing else to this game.

Still want to play? Enjoy the worst voice acting I have ever heard and somehow, the graphics look worse than Postal II. The gameplay and weapons are all grotesque, and not in a good way. The ""sick humor"" is about as sick as my dying veteran, grandpa, bland and just lies there laughing to himself like a four year old that finds the word ""booger"" to be the funniest thing ever. Can't believe I wasted my money on this and I wish I could get a refund and afford to see a therapist about this game."

Честно сказать я  не ожидал что смогу пройти эту игру. Потому что Postal 3 это такая игра, в которую хочется сыграть, но сделать это очень сложно! Она сильно глючит (причём, чему тут глючить я не понимаю, игра сделана на старом движке с картонной графикой), AI противников настолько глупп, что я даже не помню ближайший ориентир с другими играми в настоящее время, а мой любимый журнал Игромания поставил игре 1,5 балла из 10.

Однако, я думаю, многие согласятся со мной, что Postal - это игра в которую все играют не из за перечисленных выше вещёй. Главный козырь всех Посталов - это шутки и чёрный юмор. И Посталу 3 в этом деле просто нет равных. В каждой миссии вас постоянно будут смешить все без исключения ситуации в которые попадает безбашенный Чувак. Некоторые шутки и ситуации настолько смешны, что порой даже падаешь со стула! И этот ритм игра держит от начала до самого конца. 
И к слову, самое первое что меня рассмешило это то что в игре появилась система укрытий и перескакивания через препятсятвия. Причём это подчистую скопировано с Mass Effect 2, но только сделано так неуклюже, что все кто играл в ME2 будут громко смеяться!

Притом у Чувака появился выбор. Вы можете быть хорошим или плохим. От этого выбора зависит дальнейшая история прохождения. Т.е. в игре фактически 2 истории расчитанные на несколько прохождений. И это не значит, что если вы выберете хорошую сторону то вы обязаны стать ангелом во плоти. Да, большинство врагов нужно просто оглушать, а не расчленять. Однако когда начнётся перестрелка и нужно будет защищать мирное население, то вы всегда сможете достать канистру с бензином и повеселиться с дядюшкой напалмом.  
Кроме того меня очень порадовало музыкальное сопровождение игры. Оно очень бодрое и весёлое. Играть с ним одно удовольствие. 
Кстати, под конец игры, играет такая тяжёлая и напряжённая мелодия, что даже не веришь, что играешь в игру типо Postal. В общем всем кто писал музыку для Постал 3 отдельный респект.

Ну и конечно нельзя пройти мимо русской озвучки игры, выполненную версией ""Кураж - Бамбей"". Я как поклонник Дениса Колесникова был очень рад услышать его голос в этой игре.",

Like my review of Postal 2, this review will broken down in the same areas

Gameplay, Graphics, Sound and most importantly Story

Warning: this is my opinon and if anything offends you, i deeply apolgize

Gameplay 5/10: the overall gmeplay isn't all to bad, the controls aren't bad but they are a big difference from its predecessor, the main control feature i like about this game is you don't have to use the mouse scroll for changing your guns, you can now use X and C for that which for me (being a console gamer for 16 years) is a big up for me since i'm still new to the PC controls. The game praises it's so called ""advanced AI"" but in reality the so-called ""advanced AI"" isn't so advanced unless advanced AI means running in your line of fire and killing all the ""advanced AI"" in like two seconds

Graphics 6/10: the graphics of this game are not that bad but also not that good for a game that was realeased in 2011. there are times where the graphics acutally look complete and then other times your face palming with more regert than Patrick Stewert.

Sound 8/10: this is the only department that this game did good in. The BGM of this game is amazing, the only time the BGM is bad, is that it is stuck in a never-ending loop, so in the longer levels in the game it starts to become a ear ache. The sound F/X of this game is why the sound gets an 8 out of 10 instead of being a perfect score, the gun noises in this aren't as realistic as they were Postal 2, but they aren't horrible either, at least they are actually sounds instead of one guy making ""pew-pew"" noises.

Story 6/10: the only reason this game's story did better than Postal 2 is because it's more of a linear based game, so there is more room for story, but the main reason ot only did a point better was becasue it's story was all over the f***ing place, when i finally beat the game, i had no f***ing idea what the f*** happend, the story has more holes in it than swiss cheese or a Micheal Bay movie (uggh don't get me started on him)

Overall 4.5/10: Overall this game needs A LOT more work and if it was developed on for a little bit longer (i'd say like two more years) it may have been a better game but I personally think that it should have been the exact same game as the second but with a new story and graphics like Halo 3. (ahhh if only) But before i go, the nic people over at Anthology Production, are making a mod for Postal 2, and it's basically taking Postal 3 and putting it into the engine of the second game and more! So i cannot wait for it to come out. so as you can see I do NOT reccomend this game but if you really want to play this s***ty game than wait for that mod.","After I bought Postal 2, i saw that there was a third one and it had modern-day graphics and i thought that was pretty cool and then I saw all the negative reviews except for the literally only postive review and i thought to myself, hmmm I wonder how bad this game is? Seeing as how the second one was badass and amazingly better than some of the AAA games we get served today, so i bought it, played it and beat it, and now i now why this game is slandered, even RWS has given up on this trainwreck but before i trash this game more i have to say there are parts of this game that are good but far from being awesome.

Like my review of Postal 2, this review will broken down in the same areas

Gameplay, Graphics, Sound and most importantly Story

14324895,russian,2015.01.04 18:24,✅,✅,0.434649229,75,"Эта игра гениальна! О да, никакой Dead Rising 3 не сравнится с её супер-пупер-мегакровавым угаром, а эти типичные Акелловские шуточки заставят вас обосраться от смеха! Давайте разберём этот шедевр на кучу деталек. 

Прежде всего хотелось бы отметить ИДЕАЛЬНУЮ МУЗЫКУ, хотя бы за историю её появления. Сидели такие уебаны из RWS и Акеллы, гладили овцу после бурной ночи и один такой ка-ак привстал и сказал - ""Нам нужна креативная музыка!"" И вот они позвали одного хитреца из Акеллы написать хоть какую-то музыку. Почему хитреца? Потому что он сначала попросил аванс (50 рублей), купил прости-титку в Тайланде по акции ""Мужчины дешевле"" и провёл с ней самые жаркие пять секунд на синтезаторе в своей жизни, а потом такой включил то что получилось и думает ""Вот ведь я пиздец какой умный, а может мне написать и второй трек к этой игре?"", но поскольку он знал что аванса ему больше не светит (Ибо 50 рублей это его месячная зарплата), он просто уронил на клавиши синтезатора кирпич, поставил эти три секунды на перемотку и - вуаля, готов саундтрек! О да, он в этой игре действует как пердёжь Картмана из South Parkа на яйца, вы постоянно будете хотеть ср-ать! А если вы, не дай вам Господь, играете в Postal III в наушниках, то царство Вам небесное, вы были плохим человеком. Нахер Ханса Циммера, если есть ПОСТААААЛ!!!!

Графика в этой игре тоже поражает своей гениальностью. Поскольку русские не додумались бы подражать полякам и спиздить движок десятилетней давности из F.E.A.R.а, до этого додумались хитрецы из RWC и зачем-то прилепили на своего урода движок от легендарной Халвы, причём очевидно что от самой первой! Динамическое освещение, тени и просто текстурки выглядят просто потрясно от третьего лица, примерно также потрясно как выпитая бутылка пива - вам захочется блевать и ссаться! Я в экстазе!

Естесственно главный герой, о да, он просто шикарен! Это вам не морпех, не учёный, не просто мирный житель - теперь вам доверили поиграть за дауна, озвучивший которого постоянно глотал слюни и сопли при разговоре! Ведь в какой ещё игре Вы готовы будете убивать миллионы замужних матерей за розовый пылесос?! О да, только в Постале 3. Поступки главного героя могут сделать из него добряка, злодея или просто психопата, на*уй Масс Эффект, даёшь Постал III !!! Отличная, блин, игра.

Пару слов об озвучке. Ею занялся коллектив по озвучке СЕРИАЛОВ под названием ""Кураж Бомбеи"", о которых мы все несомненно столько слышали, раз разрабы считают озвучку профессиональной! У всего живого в этой игре только два голоса, писклявый и брутальный, причём одна озвучка может быть даже у двух разговаривающих друг с другом мужиков! О да, разве это не оху-енно?!?! ЭТО ЖЕ ПОСТААААААЛ!!!!!!

Главная страничка этого обзора - это типичный удав.комовский юмор, львиная доля которого возлегла на хрупкие плечи хитрецов из Акеллы. Им было впадлу нанять вменяемых сценаристов и они просто понапихали в игру известных персонажей и залезли в их блог, прочитали как их там стебут тролли и вставили в игру! Какой там нахуй и в пизду Saints Row когда есть ПОСТААААААЛ!!!! Я уже скоро кончу молочком с печеньками.

Ну и вывод. 1000000000000 (И ещё 100 нулей) из 10, игра на века! Пошлите на*уй все новые игры, да, вместе со мной, хором, три-четыре! Wolwenstein: The New Orden - На*уй!! Alan Wake - НА*УЙ!! , игра ""Наша маша и волшебный орех"" - НА*УЙ (Шучу), пойду поем собачьего корма и грудного молока из фальшивой сиськи мёртвой шл*хи, весь в главного героя. И помните - это ПОСТАААААЛ!!!!!

Вы спросите - ""Что с тобой, ты что-то дунул перед тем как написать этот обзор?"" И нет, дорогие друзья, отвечу я вам! Просто я играл в это дерь-мо ДВЕНАДЦАТЬ СРАНЫХ БЛ-ЯДСКИХ ЧАСОВ!!! Не смотрите на наигранные часы, я играл в автономном режиме чтобы не позориться перед друзьями и коллегами. Играйте только в ПОСТАЛ!",

+ Бесшовный мир
+ Движок Source
+ Транспорт
+ Нелинейность
+ Куча квестов
+ Хорошая графика
И многое другое....

Запустив игру я был сразу проникся саундтреком (который доставлял удовольствие на протижении всей игры) из главного меню и начал новую игру....

- Слегка измененная история Apocalypse Weekend меня сразу смутила
- Всё лагало, благо исправлялось после махинаций в файлах игры (но, увы, не до конца)
- Долгие экраны загрузки
- Пошлость - перебор, причём очень большой
- Озвучка (давайте мы пригласим звезду, которая переведёт нам только пару ключевых персов, одним голосом)
- Отсутствие транспорта (Сегвей? Простите, а это ВООБЩЕ ТРАНСПОРТ?)
- Мир оказался ещё как шовным, плюс комбо с долгими загрузками
- На всех женщин одно лицо - лицо нацистского зомби-эмбриона
- Тупость ИИ
- Нецензурная брань
- Плохая физика (как могли её так убить на Source?!)
- Линейность
- Глупый сюжет

Можно ещё долго перечислять недостатки - их там очень много и это печально.

13925344,russian,2015.00.10 18:56,❌,✅,0.9052123427,483,"Дилогия Postal компании Running With Scissors в свое время стала для игровой индустрии примерно тем же, что и провокационные киноленты студии Troma для Голливуда. Как и в фильмах вроде «Кровососущие уроды» или «Наци-серфингисты должны умереть», гипертрофированное насилие, сексуальные извращения и чернющий юмор в Postal 1-2 соседствовали с остросоциальной тематикой и злой сатирой на современное общество. Поэтому глава Running With Scissors Винс Дэйзи вслед за режиссером Ллойдом Кауфманом вполне мог воскликнуть: «Я делаю не трэш, а искусство!»

Однако когда Винс решил, что третью часть будут делать совместно с «Акеллой», начался самый настоящий трэш в худшем смысле этого слова. С российской стороны в разработке участвовала студия с подходящим названием — Trashmasters. В результате мы получили не xyлиганскую провокацию, а мусор в виде компьютерного кода, который для чего-то записали на диски и — о, ужас! — пытаются нам продать. Postal 3 задумывалась как следующий виток эволюции сериала. Если в первой части игроки оказывались в роли безумного Чувака и занимались в основном тем, что бесцельно расстреливали мирных жителей и животных в районах города, то во второй смысла было гораздо больше. Появился более-менее связный сюжет, герой мог свободно бродить по огромному Paradise City и выполнять разные задания. Винс Дэйзи пообещал, что в новой части виртуальный мир станет еще более открытым, а у игрока появится личный транспорт.

После начала партнерства Running With Scissors и Trashmasters об этих обещаниях никто не вспоминил. Вместо того, чтобы развиться в гипертрофированно жестокую вариацию GTA с четким сатирическим посылом, Postal 3, наоборот, деградировала до уровня первой части. Город Катарсис, куда Чувак перебрался после того, как уничтожил ядерным взрывом предыдущее место обитания, меньше чем Paradise City, а свободой на его улицах даже не пахнет. Вся игра — это череда примитивных миссий в нескольких районах. Суть их, как правило, сводится к расстрелу десятков клонов, да и начинаются они практически одинаково. В поисках заработка Чувак соглашается на низкооплачиваемую работу и чаще всего с помощью пылесоса убирает помет животных, яблоки или грязные платки в борделе. А потом его атакуют клоны, то есть совершенно одинаковые враги.

На улицах бесцельно шатаются точно такие же клоны мирных жителей, которых нисколько не смущают трупы ваших противников. С транспортом разработчики наших ожиданий не оправдали: прокатиться дают лишь на печально известных самокатах Seagway. Но управлять ими неприятно: двухколесные устройства ведут себя как утюги на льду. Впрочем, даже в таком виде у Postal 3 были шансы стать неплохим пародийным экшеном. Здесь можно встретить арабских террористов во главе с Усамой бен Ладеном, поработать на бывшего порно-магната, который стал мэром города, и убить горе-режиссера Уве Болла. Можно кидаться во врагов ульями с пчелами, расстреливать их из пылесоса, терзать портативным барсуком, натравливать на противников любимую псину Чувака, кошек и обезьян. Агрессивные зверушки делают с людьми очень неприятные вещи.

Для любителей традиционного насилия приготовлены дробовики, пулеметы, автоматы, гранаты и даже реализована система укрытий. Все портит исполнение. Running With Scissors напрямую в разработке не участвовала, и это заметно: сделана Postal 3 в худших традициях русских экшенов. То есть это очень глючная, неоптимизированная стрелялка с неудобным управлением (пока найдешь нужное оружие можно заработать невроз), совершенно тупыми врагами и убогим трехкопеечным дизайном. Система укрытий прикручена для галочки, а из всего многообразия оружия реально задействуется лишь пара пушек и, с позволения сказать, «гаджетов».

Как известно, глава компании, производящей самокаты «сегвеи», погиб во время катания на своем детище. Он не справился с управлением и свалился в реку. С Postal 3 случилось примерно то же самое. Из-за стремления разработчиков любыми способами эпатировать аудиторию проект скатился в неиграбельную трэш-пародию на самого себя. Если во вторую часть вполне можно было играть, и многие при этом получали, пусть и специфическое, но удовольствие, то механика Postal 3 не выдерживает никакой критики и вызывает ассоциации с кучами навоза, которые регулярно убирает главный герой. Как жаль, что под рукой нет подходящего пылесоса.",

I honestly believe that the Russian Dev group really tried to make this a great game.

And, really, it's close to it. 

However, it falls short. I'll attempt to tell you why, in very few words.

This has the feel of a proper Postal game. Moreover, it's got the voice and design of what should be a postal game.
Where it falls short is crappy code.

It jerks when it should fug. Really, it's a system hog, and unless you are cheating in Godmode, and notarget, it's almost unplayable. Yet, if you do figure out how to enable those, you will see what this game could be, and almost IS.

The hilarious scenarios are there, as are the ridiculous weapons and characters. Plus, there is a split in the story where you decide to be good or evil. The problem is that the gameplay is just retardedly difficult. Not only because of the sheer number of MASSIVELY respawning opponents, but the jerky, unavoidable video issues. With the highest specs, you will still discover horrible curse words you never remembered learning spouting like a turettes volcano from your twitching lips as you desperately try to navigate the horrible issues crippling this diamond in the rough.

Yet...as I've mentioned, if you just give in, and pull a cheat or two (there's even a workaround for steam achievements), you will discover pure joy in this bastard child of the already black sheep of the gaming community.

I will refrain from describing any scenarios in detail, as your experience will differ depending on your personal bent, as it should be. So, wait for a sale (I waited for a year to get it at 50%), and find the cheat. Then, you will giggle your ass off, and hopefully, experience a little of what the guys intended. 

Honestly, it's worth the hassle. It's a shame that RWS isn't making money from it, but hopefully, one day, they will get access to the code, and make it what it should be.

Until then, get it cheap, get some cheats, and laugh your ass off at what is very close to a wonderful slice of Postal history.

Zamknięty świat, brak eksploracji, hermetyczna rozgrywka. Mimo że widać potencjał w misjach to najlepszy element P2 został wycięty (eksploracja). W kilku misjach możemy pozwiedzać to 'miasto', które mogłoby być dzielnicą Paradise z Postala 2.

Pros:

+ its Postal through and through, Sex , Violence, Racism, Animal Abuse and tons of other stuff that made this franchise famous
+ the story is pretty funny
+ many new and old weapons to choose from
+ a new city to explore
+ some celebrity characters
+ great sense of humor and satire
+ multiple paths to choose from, that actually change things up


Cons:

- on a technical side the game is a complete mess. So many bugs,glitches and crashes, I will point out the worst one by one
- a bug caused one of my save games to crash on being loaded.....that pissed me off so much since I was far into the game
- ALL the mlee weapons are absolutley useless.....you cant hit anything because they are so extremley poorly programmed - hit detection is a absurd
- 3rd person view is pointless and even worse can trigger bugs and camera glitches.......why not stick with first person? This is a major downer!
- ranged weapons feel way off when aiming, you can hit your targets but it just feels so bad to aim
- gasoline is buggy and doesnt work like in postal 2, you cant pour it onto people anymore, they have to walk on the ground you´re pouring at (like I said, many special weapons are buggy)
- way too many missions stick to the same formular - horde shooter where you have to take out certain people
- many random crashes
- you cant mount a cat on a gun -_-  seriously whos decision was it to remove this feature? Its like one of the most iconic things in Postal 2!
- the explorable city is pretty small, there isnt much to actually do, I expected some kind of funny mini games, there are funny arcade cabins, but they are only cosmetic.....how disappointing
- the enemy AI is none-existent.......they are so incredibly incompetent at doing anything
- and like I said....many many bugs in missions and scripted events

Oh Postal.....I loved the second one, and the humor and one liners are back....but with such a horrible gameplay mechanics thats its barely playable. I played through the good campaign and it crashed too much on the bad campaign and I deinstalled in rage. If this gets waaaaay lower in price I can recommend this to a hardcore fan, other than that keep away from this.","I love Postal 2! And I loved the humor and story of Postal 3.

Nothing like Postal 2, the controls are clunky as shit, and there are SO MANY LOADING SCREENS. Seriously, there is one stage where its just you in a room waiting to push a button, be prepared for many many one off scenes like this. There is no real explorable world to mess with, its just isolated scenes you do a single mission per scene.

The combat, holy fucking christ the combat, how do you mess something like that up ? Theres a scene where you fight these crazy soccer moms, but ""making them leave"" is almost impossible as they seem to take 10 fully charged stun gun shots and NOTHING HAPPENS. The vagueness in the combat system and missions are laughable at best and after so long get annoying as hell. This is also the first game I have encountered where the crosshairs are completely useless, so that is another gem of a fuck up to add to the ongoing list of fail this game has.

Just buy postal 2 and forget this game came out until RWS decides to make their own kick ass addition to the series instead of this outsourced joke of a ""game"".

*UPDATE* Another thing to note: I beat this game in 10 hours, and it only took 10 hours cause i am an achievement slut who will waste lots of free time on any achieve if its there. So this is maybe an 8 hour game at most.","Terribad.

Продажность и лицемерие в каждом пикселе. Экраны заставки это вообще реклама арт-бука (сделанная явно гениальными дизайнерами, поскольку так отвратительно нарисовать задники надо еще уметь блин, без какого-либо сочетания цветов) и дерьмового фильма Уве Болла. 
кстати даже экранизация Уве была ближе к оригиналу чем это, потому что там были годные шутки (две три может быть) и было весело, даже несмотря на то что и стыдно. 
Стрельба в Постале 2 приносила удовольствие. Ты чувствовал каждый выстрел, мог выбрать что угодно самостоятельно. И стрелял ты по всем подряд. Или мог не стрелять. Был выбор. Но если ты и стрелял последтствия шли за тобой по пятам и чувствовалась динамика. Чувак оставался тем же Чуваком, но мир вокруг него менялся. Каждый день появлялось что-то новенькое.
Ах да, еще и эти диалоги. О! Я могу написать таких тысячу. Шутки про салфетки от кончи. ХА! Божественно мать вашу! И злые мамки, ах эти злые мамки! Я что блин играю в игрушку которую создали 13 летние подростки с синдромом дауна (да простят меня все дауны мира, за то что я назвала их создателями столь богомерзкого высера, это нестерпимое оскорбление)? В оригинальной игре тоже были шутки на грани фола. Черный юмор там повсюду. Но это не тупые каламбуры, а высмеивание и стеб, не переходящий грани блевотного уровня. 
Из нормального в игре только шутка про Уве Болла и использование барсука в качестве оружия, и то это все на последних уровнях, а до этого уныние шо атас.
Оптимизация и управление заслуживают отдельной похвалы. Целишься на бабу ,стреляешь не в середину её груди, а где-то в плечо? Не попал лошара! 
На мою беду я еще и русификатор скачала. Чувак не затыкался ни на секунду. И как же это бесило.... Выстрелил? Реплика! Сдох? Реплика! Встал в ступоре? Реплика! Да мать твою ты можешь не комментировать то как весело ты двигаешь пальцем левой ноги????

  But why is it not like Postal 2 and feels so... Dissapointing and unfinished comparing to Postal 2? Let's compare those games. First of all, the old postal two was sort of a soup made of chaos, blood, gore and insanity as a topping. And the whole soup was made in a bowl of some weak law system. That game was finished. It felt so complete and just complex enough. It was a great game and my favourite game since childhood. I was very excited when I saw this game come out. It was so promissing. But when I actually got it and played it, something felt wrong about it. It is still a great and fun game, but for me it is not ''Postal''. It is much more sane, even too sane to be honoust. It is VERY short, it has much less black humor in it. Gosh! I miss those fat ladies showing their middle finger and moving their jaw weirdly as they speak. Now it is not as insane, not as chaotic and above all, it is not a fee roam game. Personally, I prefer Postal 2 to this one. This game just feels like a ''lesser'' copy of Postal 2 that has less of everything but graphics. Controls are kind of overly complicated. Characters are not as dumb and mean as they used to be. 
  If you never played Postal 2 or wish to play a cheap and good shooter with some dirtyness and black humor in it, this is the perfet game for you.
  But if you are looking for a game that feels just like Postal 2, that has this chaotic insane spirit that Postal 2 had, I would reccomend you to rather spend 50$ to buy Dead Rising 3. That game feels so much like Postal 2.

Even after learning the backstory of the game (RWS Inc. hired an underfunded and tyrannical game developer company from Russia to code the game), I decided to give it a second chance. Sure, I wouldn't get all the extra little achievements like I did with the first two Postals, but I'd at least beat the game and give it a fair judgment from that, right?

Wrong. I had completely forgotten what it was that had kept me from playing this game in the first place. It wasn't the linear levels (Postal 1 had linear levels). It wasn't the stupid jokes or the weird weapons and minigames (Postal 2 had stupid jokes and weird weapons and minigames). It was the gameplay. Yes, Akeela Software (or whatever they call themselves) had suffered through a Russian economic crash and in suffering fired their competent, cooperative developers and assigned this project to a group of Prima Donnas who not only couldn't correctly string a game together even if it was coming out of their own ass, but also deliberately altered the structure of the game against the wishes of RWS Inc. (you know, the people who wrote the game series and own the rights to them and CONTRACTED Akeela TO DO MAKE THE GAME THAT RWS had envisioned!!!). Not only that, but Akeela also refused to release the code to the general public because they didn't want those loyal gamers to make MODs or anything, even though RWS Inc. wanted them to. As a result, the gameplay is sticky, jagged, the graphics go photo-negative after 15 minutes of gameplay and glitches flood this game. For example, I had to restart a level because the game wouldn't let me open a door that was integral to the plot, and the escort mission with the segways was almost impossible. All in all, it kept me from enjoying this game not once but twice, which is a shame, because otherwise, I thought it could have been an enjoyable game. 

*SPOILER ALERT* For those still interested in knowing, the game pickups where the second one left off: after detonating Paradise, Arizona with a nuke, the Postal dude drove to the next closest fictional town in Arizona, Catharsis. There, a wealthy Ron Jeremy owns and runs everything with a pretty open mind. The problem is that he's constantly being undermined or even flat out attacked by Eco-terrorists, Al Queda, God-fearing hockey moms (led by Sarah Palin...wait...why is she in Arizona?!) and other satirical and colorful characters. The Postal Dude, just trying to make a buck, is given constant choices as to whose side he is on, or at least which side he wants to flip flop to and from. While the levels are linear, your actions do choose the course of the game.   Unlike the last game, the third Postal gives you a Max Payne type of third person layout and aiming system, and you get most of the weapons from the previous game, plus a few new ones like beehives, a shopvac (filled with questionably stained tissues) and the badgersaw.

Erstens es ruckelte, schmiert ständig irgendwo ab, und scheinbar wird es ab der zweiten Mission unspielbar. Da Ron viel zu schnell krepiert, zudem die scheiß Weiber, mit einer Knarre auf einem rumballern, während man selber einen ""STAUBSAUGER"" mit Schuss funktion hat, der aber verdammt schnell leer wird. Nur gut, das ich im Summer Sale nur knapp 10€ bezahlt habe. 19,99€ ist es auf gar keinen Fall wert.

Wer noch RICHTIG Spaß haben will, sollte sich Postal 2 kaufen, der meiner Meinung nach DER BESTE TEIL der Trilogie ist.

(NON STAVOLTA DUDE!)

PRO:

-nonostante tutto diverte
-carina l'idea della scelta: buono o cattivo
-ho apprezzato maggiormente le sparatorie
-arsenale sempre ricco con piccole chicche
-graficamente nulla da dire, si presenta bene
-ottimo il doppiaggio di Corey Cruise per Dude
-seppur inserite male le musiche sono carine e varie

CONTRO: (tralasciando la pubblicazione di tale opera...)

-senza la RWS Postal non è Postal...
-troppi pochi contenuti in confronto al predecessore
-tecnicamente è un disastro... (bug ovunque)
-molti achievements buggati, altri non raggiungibili
-spesso instabile ed enormi cali di FPS in varie sezioni
-mappa spoglia, quasi mai esplorabile e non degna di nota
-difficoltà sparite, non puoi più scegliere nulla...

CONCLUSIONE:

Dice tutto il fatto che la RWS l'abbia non solo rinnegato ma anche offeso più e più volte negli anni successivi tramite il secondo capitolo di recente aggiornato tramite l'espansione...
Postal III infatti è come molti altri un gioco che semplicemente non doveva uscire ma che hanno rilasciato in una grave crisi che stava assillando la casa che si occupava del gioco in questione proprio in quegli anni, per questo il gioco all'inizio prometteva bene e magari, dico magari, poteva venir fuori qualcosa di paragonabile o seppur superiore al secondo capitolo; ma come vi ho già detto senza entrare in dettaglio il gioco è stato vittima di un pessimo e frettoloso sviluppo in balia di crisi finanziarie alle porte che ne hanno quindi compromesso lo sviluppo.
Nemmeno successivi e tentati restauri hanno portato a qualcosa e solo in questi ultimi anni si parla di una sorta di mod per restaurarne l'originale contenuto, ma nulla di finale od ufficiale...
Ma cosa presenta questo gioco tanto buggato e con uno sviluppo tanto problematico alle spalle?
Per prima cosa nonostante l'ironia tipica del secondo nel gioco si vede l'assenza della RWS e non si respira la stessa aria anche a causa dei forti cambiamenti come la terza persona, che nonostante non sia poi così male, non è andata giù a molte persone anche per l'impossibilità o difficoltà di compiere determinate azioni più comode nel secondo come quella di urinare ovunque si voglia.
La città non è più esplorabile o non offre semplicemente più tutti i contenuti che prima offriva come segreti, armi speciali e la libertà di esplorare quel bizzarro mondo ricco di contenuti ora spoglio, piccolo e noioso; le molteplici difficoltà sono sparite e talvolta il gioco risulta troppo facile e frustrante in altre...
Insomma senza entrare in altri dettagli vale l'acquisto? per me sì, ma solo ad alcune condizioni: il gioco offre davvero pochi contenuti e lo finirete in nulla; presenta talvolta crash improvvisi, enormi cali di frame in varie sezioni e bug ovunque tu vada (achievements compresi); insomma un gioco davvero malridotto e sconsigliato addirittura dalla RWS stessa in più occasioni... ma perchè lo consiglio? lo consiglio esclusivamente a chi si aspetti il peggio e non abbia pretese, a chi vuole conoscere questo ""Postal di un'altra dimensione e degli incubi"" come visto nell'espansione del secondo, agli impavidi giocatori pronti anche al peggio pur di completare la saga.
Lo consiglio in quanto nonostante i difetti oggettivi del gioco per quel poco che mi ha offerto mi sono divertito e non mi è dispiaciuto provare questo capitolo alternativo; mi aspettavo maggiori crash sinceramente e nonostante tutto se lo trattate come tale, ossia come un gioco fallito per le proprie cause e non completo come doveva essere, potete anche affrontarlo senza troppi problemi anche solo per curiosità o per completare la saga pur essendo a conoscenza degli eventuali rischi che correte a qualche misero spiccio o addirittura gratis quando possibile, quindi aspettate un ulteriore calo di prezzo se possibile o prendetelo in sconto o da qualche altra parte in quanto non vale assolutamente un prezzo pieno...

This is a really god awful 3rd person shooter with terrible gun combat mechanics, a broken melee system with horrible hit detection, and remember the open world non linear structure of Postal 2? Well now it's 100% linear. It wasn't until months after its release that they put in an open world mode which is just a save file with the whole city and no missions. That was the only midly decent thing in the whole game. Another thing that sucks is that they don't even have the Postal Dude's voice actor from the last game.

Do you want to know what the worst part of this game is? A good 80-85% of the game are escort/protection missions. Apparantly in Russia game devs think that gamers LOVE escort missions with the worst AI so they should make that the focus of the game. Because when you think Postal, you totally think of escort missions. Maybe that's what was missing from Postal 1&2. The game's long series of escort missions involve never ending spaws of enemies who all have one goal which is to kill your target and shoot at you. The guy you protect has no logic, they just stand there getting shot until they die. In missions where you need to follow someone to a goal, they often just stop or get stuck on something while the endless enemies kill them. When it comes to protecting someone in a single location, it's more of the same, they stand in once place and get shot to death.

The story is passable, but you can watch all the cut scenes on YouTube and save yourself $20. One thing that was promised was branching story paths with real drastic changes to the plot, like what jobs you have, such as being a cop or a terrorist, or even running for president. The reality is that the game has a karma meter and the more innocents that die in your crossfire, the more the meter turns evil which puts you on the evil path. One of the first ""evil"" missions has you on a cult where you use their version of the Gravity Gun from Half-Life to suck up apples and shoot them in barrels, 100 apples. They actually thought this would be fun. In the end, it's the same old crap, and I never did find a way to gain moral points. You just lose morality from accidently killing people with the terrible controls.

That's the whole game. There's a ton of escort missions, really bad shoot 'em up levels that have terrible level design (often getting you lost,) tons and tons of glitches, a variety of weapons, but none of them are that useful, the worst AI possible, weak voice acting, a lame story, and the creators of Postal had nothing to do with the making of this game, they infact disowned this game and pulled it from their web store.

That's the whole game. There's a ton of escort missions, really bad shoot 'em up levels that have terrible level design (often getting you lost,) tons and tons of glitches, a variety of weapons, but none of them are that useful, the worst AI possible, weak voice acting, a lame story, and the creators of Postal had nothing to do with the making of this game, they infact disowned this game and pulled it from their web store. I remember a lot of critics hating Postal 2 and giving it crazy low scores without even playing it, but this game actually deserves to be bashed. There's just nothing fun about it. Not even mods could ever fix this mess of a game."

Postal 3, now officialy renamed Russian Postal, is game publised by the bancrupt Akella Studios and produced by (defunct at the game's release) studio Trashmasters. You play as Not the Postal  dude from Postal 2 by surviving an onslaught of whacky shenaningans in the city of Catharsis.The game is a linear third person shooter that pits you against ecologists, Asians and bees. Your arsenal ranges from graffiti cans to rabid badgers and shotguns. There are also moral choices to consider that eventually determine which ending you get at the completion of the campaign.

Sorry, the previous paragraph praising Russian Postal is made of lies and I am a terrible person, but hey, have an imaginary biscuit as a reward for reading this far! Now on to the actual review:

Russian Postal is so terrible it's not even funny. The game has never been properly tested (if tested at all) upon its release which is noticable right from the moment you boot it up. If it doesn't crash, good for you, it will do so later, a bunch of times.   The main campaign is broken into missions which open as you progress through the story. They offer a variety of things from stealing sagways from gay bikers to protecting Uwe Boll from DnD nerds and trekkies, crammed with awkward stereotypes and 'hillarious' jokes. The little writing this game had really shines here when you scratch your head on reffereces that stopped being funny 10 years ago.

Gameplay wise the game is passable, but not anything stellar. Everything happends in third person and you use your mouse and keyboard to navigate, fire weapons, scroll your inventory and huff catnip. The problem is that most of the creative weapons like the badger saw, machete and the fart gun are ALL useless because physical damage is paltry and the hitboxes are broken to hell, which makes you swining at air instead of your assailants. It doesn't really help going mellee because every enemy in this game carries a machine gun and is also an ace shooter. The firearm encounters chew your ammunition in mere seconds and leave you with half-dozen unusable weapons  Therefore the game forces you to farm bullets from NPCs, which also mostly use mellee weapons...ah and the loading times between zones are atrocious. Fun!

Where little the game DOES shine are its cutscenes, which have some artistic merrit and are genuinely funny, but they are not worthy buying Russian Postal nor the pain of enduring it. My praise ends here.

In the end I can't really recommend this game to anyone, with the exception of gifting it as means to an end a frienship or a relationship. Postal fans will be dissappointed because it's a downgrade from the previous two games, achievers won't be satisfied either because some trophies are not attainable due to poor coding. If you are a masochist and enjoy playing broken games with zero satisfaction, this one is right up your alley!

Final verdict: two thumbs down and a fart /10","You will like this game, if you're a masochist!

Ich mochte den schwarzen Humor und die völlig übertriebene Gewalt. Ich habe mich total auf Postal 3 gefreut und als es dann da war haben es fast alle schlecht gemacht und beleidigt, nicht ganz zu recht! Denn es ist immer noch das was man von Postal erwartet, pervers und krank aber witzig! Postal 3 kann man gar nicht auf Steam kaufen, deshalb hab ich es von nem Keyshop, wieso steht da dann der preis wenn es eh nicht zu kaufen geht!?!? Verarsche! Ok, nun zum Spiel: Die Grafik ist deutlich besser als im Vorgänger und passt zu Postal. Wenn man anfängt einfach auf Leute zu schießen und sie tötet, rennen alle in der Nähe panisch umher, wimmern, rufen nach den Cops, das ist schonmal geil gemacht! Man kann auch jemand den Arm, Beim die Hand oder den Fuß abtrennen und aufheben und damit werfen, warum erwähnt das niemand!?!? Sowas ist ne coole Gameplayneuerung und ich habe das seit Die by the Sword vermisst! (Kennt das überhaupt wer?) Aber leider wirkt das Spiel sehr unfertig und stürzt ständig ab und dann geht das letzte Savegame meistens nicht mehr sodas man das davor nehmen muss...Dann die langen Ladezeiten, WIESO??? So toll ist die Grafik auch wieder nicht das diese Berechtigt sind, kacke Programmiert würd ich sagen! Aber ich empfehle es trotzdem jedem der Postal 2 mag, der wird diesen Teil auch wieder mögen! Man sollte nur frustresistent sein da es teilweise derbe schwer ist! Man kann kein Schwierigkeitsgrad auswählen und dann kommen die laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangen Ladezeiten dazu und häufigen abstürze! Aber ich hatte und habe immer noch sehr viel spass mit dem Spiel! Gebt dem Spiel eine Chance, Postal-Fans und lasst euch nicht von irgendwelchen Magazinen beeinflussen, die anderen Spielen immer wieder Wertungen geben die sie nicht verdient haben!

Update: Nachdem ich den Windows 8.1 Fix (der den Kopierschutz aufhebt) installiert habe, den man ja braucht um das Game unter Windows 8.1 überhaupt zocken zu können, hab ich bemerkt, das das Spiel nun viel stabiler läuft! Es ist erst 1x beim laden abgestürzt,sonst nicht! Keine Abstürze mehr!!! Richtig geil! Der Nachteil ist, das Spiel stürzt jetzt jedes mal ab wenn ich eine Granate oder Katze werfe...Naja mir egal! Man kann die ja auch hinlegen...^^ Ich kann endlich nochmal Postal III durchzocken im guten Pfad, ENDLICH!!!

9225611,german,2014.01.23 03:53,✅,✅,0.6091754436,27,"Also hier mal meine Meinung:
 
Pro:
- Akzeptable Grafik (nicht die beste, aber für 2011 in Ordnung und deutlich besser als im 2. Teil)
- Witzige Zwischensequenzen und Missionen
- Viele Neue Waffen
- Splatter/Gore-Effekte sind detailreicher als im Vorgänger
- Deutsche Untertitel
- Story wird durch Verhalten des Spielers beeinflusst
- Neue Sprüche des Protagonisten

Contra:
- Häufige Abstürze
- Open World erst nach Beendigung des Spiels (trotzdem weniger Freiheit als in POSTAL 2, kaum Gebäude betretbar)
- Fehlerhaftes Ziel/Deckungssystem
- KI-Fehler
- Übersetzungs/Textfehler (teils fehlen bei den Untertiteln ganze Worte und Silben)
- Viele Bugs (Grafikfehler, Bewegungsunfähigkeit, Passanten bleiben an Gegenständen hängen und zucken)
- schlecht ausgereifte KI (Leute bewegen sich wie auf Schienen)

Fazit:

Das Spiel ist definitiv nicht so schlecht, wie es oft beschrieben wird. Es unterhält mich sehr gut und wird (zumindest mir) auch nach längerer Spielzeit nicht langweilig. Allerdings nerven die zahlreichen Fehler. Es wirkt so, als ob die Entwickler eine frühe Beta-Version released haben. Der Vorgänger ist in jeder Hinsicht besser und auch deutlich günstiger. Leuten, die den 2. Teil mochten und nicht sehr auf KI, Technik und Grafik fixiert sind, sondern einfach nur Spaß am Spiel haben wollen, würde ich dieses Spiel trotz allem empfehlen!",

8326082,russian,2013.11.27 10:49,❌,✅,0.8085454106,205,"Когда Running решил, что третью часть будут делать совместно с «Акеллой», начался самый настоящий трэш в худшем смысле этого слова. С российской стороны в разработке участвовала студия с подходящим названием — Trashmasters. В результате мы получили не хулиганскую провокацию, а мусор в виде компьютерного кода, который для чего-то записали на диски и — о, ужас! — пытаются нам продать. Postal 3 задумывалась как следующий виток эволюции сериала. Если в первой части игроки оказывались в роли безумного Чувака и занимались в основном тем, что бесцельно расстреливали мирных жителей и животных в районах города, то во второй смысла было гораздо больше. Появился более-менее связный сюжет, герой мог свободно бродить по огромному Paradise City и выполнять разные задания. Винс Дэйзи пообещал, что в новой части виртуальный мир станет еще более открытым, а у игрока появится личный транспорт.
После начала партнерства Running With Scissors и Trashmasters об этих обещаниях никто не вспоминил. Вместо того, чтобы развиться в гипертрофированно жестокую вариацию GTA с четким сатирическим посылом, Postal 3, наоборот, деградировала.
Вся игра — это череда примитивных миссий в нескольких районах. Суть их, как правило, сводится к расстрелу десятков клонов, да и начинаются они практически одинаково. В поисках заработка Чувак соглашается на низкооплачиваемую работу и чаще всего с помощью пылесоса убирает помет животных, яблоки или грязные платки в борделе. А потом его атакуют клоны, то есть совершенно одинаковые враги.
Из-за стремления разработчиков любыми способами эпатировать аудиторию проект скатился в неиграбельную трэш-пародию на самого себя. Если во вторую часть вполне можно было играть, и многие при этом получали, пусть и специфическое, но удовольствие, то механика Postal 3 не выдерживает никакой критики и вызывает ассоциации с кучами навоза, которые регулярно убирает главный герой. Как жаль, что под рукой нет подходящего пылесоса.",

8236053,english,2013.11.24 02:22,❌,❌,0.8464529514,351,"This game is a mess... and let me count the ways.

1. A broken melee system: Postal, true to the franchise, offers many different tools of the trade to dispose of your enemies. And some of the tools include a sledgehammer, machete, fire axe, and something else I can't remember. But none of that matters because the only one that works is the fucking machete. It is extremely difficult to land your blow on enemies with other weapons, including your kick, but it doesn't matter because the fire axe and sledgehammer don't even do any damage.

2. Abysmal Gunplay: Would you be surprised if I told you this is the strongest gameplay element? Cuz it is. Is it because it's fun? No. Is it because there's cool weapons? No. It's because guns are pretty much the only gameplay element that functions. A headshot kills any enemy instantly. So, if you don't want to deal with the awfulness of every other tool of the trade, guns are the way to go. And don't bother with the shotgun or the MG. They're both garbage.

3. Awful Humor: Postal 2 got it's humor from satirizing both social issues and video game tropes and controversies. Postal 3 doesn't do this at all. Instead, it goes for stupid humor and shock value. Like terrorists dressing up in giant novelty moustaches and sombreros and sneaking across the US Border. Or firing man juice soaked tissue clumps at Sarah Palin in a porn shop full of men jerking it to monitors. And I'll admit, I laughed a few times, but it wasn't because I thought it was clever. Quite the opposite, in fact. I laughed because it was so utterly stupid and random that it just brought out the inner caveman. And that's the problem; Postal 3 is offensive for all the wrong reasons. There are a few times when the developers want to get tongue and cheeky with you. But it's hard to find it funny when the game keeps kicking your ass every chance it gets. Sorry Postal 3, but you can't kick me in the nads and then give me a piece of cake. It doesn't work that way.

4. What-The-Fuck Scale Performance: Do you have a decent gaming rig? Do you have an ultra powerful rig? Well neither matter because Postal 3 is terribly built and optimized. I can run mostly anything on max settings, and yet this game chugs when things get going. And even setting it to low didn't change the performance one bit. It's amazing how you can mess up so bad on an engine designed specifically for non-high end machines.

5. It's Linear & Catharsis Sucks: The entire game has you follow a very narrow path of the dude going about his day just trying to earn some money. And, as you continue, you get to make moral choices that alter which missions you do. This would be fine, if it wasn't Postal. Or, you know, at least done properly. I wanna be free to explore the city and do what I want and attack the story at my own pace. When you beat the game, you unlock the entire city to go around and play in. But when you start it you see just how bad the direction really is. They basically took what they made of the city, and then stitched together the other set pieces from missions into the mix. There's no sense of where you're going at all. It's apparent they did not design a city and split it accordingly. They just made random crap, stitched it together with duct tape, and said, ""Here this is Catharsis."" You know it's bad when you walk up to a highway offramp and end up at the gay rodeo. Oh, yeah, there's a gay rodeo too. If you were expecting more there isn't. That's pretty much the joke. Gay cowboys. Harr harr.

6. Gimmicky Weapons and Assets: Postal 3 showed off a teaser many years ago featuring the Postal dude driving around the city in a segway. They showed this more in the grindhouse trailer they showed at one of the E3 conventions. Guess what? That segway they hyped so much? It's only used in one mission. Yup. One fucking mission. Besides the stupid segway, there's other weapons apart from your normal guns and melee weapons you can use to have ""fun."" There's grenades, the gasoline tank, feral cats with super AIDS (???), etc. And all of these suffer from abysmal controls. Thrown weapons like grenades and cats involve holding down one of the mouse buttons, and then pressing the other mouse button while still holding on to the primary fire button. Or something like that. I don't know and I don't care enough to find out. It's that bad that even after 10 hours of this crap I still couldn't get the hang of throwing shit. Oh, and the gas tank? Useless. Why? Because it's hard as shit to pour the gas out over where you want it specifically and it's even harder to throw your fucking match on the gasoline you poured out.

7. Loading Screens: This game has some of the worst loading screens I've ever seen. Not only are they insanely frequent, but they take forever too. There's a loading screen to start the intro videos. Then there's another loading screen after that to load the menu. The first launch of a map or first time loading takes 1 minute and 40 seconds (Yes, I timed it) to load. After that, any other loading screens take between 35-40 seconds.

8. The Moral System: I don't mind if a game has a moral system. What I do mind, however, is when you introduce me to the moral system mechanic, teach me what it does and whatever, and then tell me at the end of the game that it doesn't matter. They try to make it a joke towards endgame with Krotchy (who gave you the tutorial in the first place) telling you it doesn't mean anything. And then at the last level they tell you it actually didn't mean anything. So if you thought you were going to get a different ending mission, or ending cutscene, based on your actions then guess what; you don't. This isn't fucking funny, Akella. That is a huge slap in the face to your fucking player base. Especially when the moral system was one of the features you boasted about in your trailers and even on this very store page.

In short: Fuck this game. Fuck Akella for making it. And fuck RWS for not making themselves and leaving it in the hands of incompetent jagoffs.","This game is a mess... and let me count the ways.

However, let's take it back a few notches.

Postal III is a third person shooter, unlike Postal 2, which was a first person shooter. The game, gameplay wise, is similar to Postal 2. You shoot shit and perform tasks.
However, Postal III introduces alignment. You can be good, or bad, and depending on your actions, you get different endings. For example, helping cops bust a hippie pot ring aligns you Good. Killing everyone during the bust aligns you Bad. That is a pretty cool feature that makes this game one of the more unique Postal games.

The game makes outside references to the likes of people such as the infamous director Uwe Boll, Gary Coleman from Postal 2, and other such things. It's got the Postal feel, and everything that is there is great, but it doesn't work all the time.

That's really my only main complaint with the game. Due to layoffs and rushes, the game is extremely buggy, and crashes often. The game runs on Valve's Source Engine.

Postal III on the inside has all the mechanics and gameplay aspects to make a good Postal game.
However, on the outside, it's a buggy mess that crashes often, has gameplay breaking bugs such as cutscenes not playing, parts of the map unrendering, and other such things. 

It's price isn't really warranted, considering it is a buggy crashing mess. If you get it gifted, or buy it out of curiosity, you might be dissapointed, but the game itself is still enjoyable if you can look passed it's flaws.

Postal III has received an updated that removes drm from the game, after being pulled from the steam store multiple times.

The biggest thing, however, is now the game is being sold for 6 dollars. This is an extremely fair price for this game. Before it was still being sold for full price.

Projekt, za którego stworzeniem stoją programiści ze studia Running With Scissors ( choć tym razem gra została zrobiona przez rosyjskie studio 	Akella,TrashMasters Studios), jak zwykle naszpikowany jest elementami czyniącymi zeń przedmiot kontrowersji nie tylko wśród samych graczy, ale także w środowiskach polityków walczących z przemocą oraz rozmaitych organizacji społecznych. Fabuła produktu, tak jak historia opowiadana w poprzednich częściach serii, skupia się na losach Postala Dude'a, sfrustrowanego osobnika, niepotrafiącego poradzić sobie ze znalezieniem stałej pracy. To w niego przychodzi nam się wcielić w kampanii dla pojedynczego gracza.
Główny wątek Postal III nawiązuje do wydarzeń, które miały miejsce w Postalu 2 oraz dodatku Apocalypse Weekend. Zniszczenie Paradise City zmusiło głównego bohatera do osiedlenia się w innym miejscu. Postal Dude wyrusza na północ, docierając do miasteczka o nazwie Catharsis.
W kampanii możemy obrać jedną z dwóch ścieżek i dołączyć do ekoterrorystów (ścieżka zła) lub wspomóc lokalne siły policyjne w walce z przestępczością (ścieżka dobra). Podobnie jak w poprzednich częściach nie musimy ograniczać się tylko do wykonywania postawionych przed nami celów, nic nie stoi bowiem na przeszkodzie, aby przy okazji wyładować frustrację głównego bohatera na niewinnych ludziach przechadzających się po mieście. Jeśli jednak będziemy w ten sposób postępować jako funkcjonariusz policji, to należy liczyć się z szybką utratą miejsca pracy. W niektórych misjach pojawiają się bossowie. Nowością w Postal III jest fakt, że akcję gry obserwujemy z perspektywy trzeciej osoby, a nie - jak dotychczas - widząc świat wyłącznie oczami prowadzonej przez siebie postaci. Podczas rozgrywki Dude spotka na swojej drodze sporą liczbę osób i to zarówno fikcyjnych, jak i zupełnie autentycznych. Wśród tych ostatnich warto wspomnieć między innymi o Uwe Bollu i Ronie Jeremym. Oprawa graficzna dziecka Trashmaster oparta została o znany z Half-Life 2 silnik Source. Do plusów gry zaliczam świetna muzyka, humor, absurdalny scenariusz, brak szacunku dla 'tematów tabu', Interesujący ""arsenał"". A co do minusów tosą one następujące: fizyka kuleje na każdym polu ,walka wręcz nie działa ,monotonia, czasami zwykła nuda ,koszmarne AI. Ogólnie klucze ciężko jest do niej dostać Akella zbańczyła. Chodza od 30 € do 3 €. Ogólnie grę polecam dla odmóżdżenia się.
Grafika 7/10 choć optymalizacja leży
Dźwięk 8/10 jest dobry i to na prawdę
Gameplay 6/10 monotonia po pewnym czasie

But I always had a semi-soft spot for the game and although it pains me to say so, I actually think it feels a lot more like Postal than 4 does, and despite the jank, is actually more enjoyable too. And although neither of the games are particularly funny, I feel it doesn't lean too much on outdated references, dead memes, genitals and literal toilet humour as Postal 4 does.

Like, is it me or does the dark humour feel like it was written by people literally declining in age as the titles went on? Postal 1 feels like it was written by a 30-something who's seen some shit, Postal 2 by someone in their 20s, Postal III by a teenager and Postal 4 by a literal child. Maybe I'm over thinking it..

That's just my opinion and I totally understand those who don't feel that way. And don't get me wrong, Postal 2 is the series' lightning in a bottle and will likely forever be the best RWS-developed Postal experience (since Brain Damaged gets pretty close).

But there's something about the Source engine, the dated but still pleasing graphics, the humour and overall tone of Postal III that makes it feel the closest to a Postal 2 sibling than we'll likely ever get and for that I have to appreciate the few things it gets right.

I'm glad it's finally getting some of the fixes and polishing it deserves, 'cause as far as I'm sadly concerned.. it's no longer the black sheep of the franchise :(

5184005,russian,2012.10.01 14:53,❌,✅,0.5454545617,2,"Наверное, самая отвратительная игра в моей библиотеке. Не поймите меня неправильно, в своё время я дал ей шанс, говоря что-то вроде ""игра плохая настолько, что это делает её шедевром в жанре трэш"". Так знайте же, это полный бред, за который мне теперь стыдно. Игра отвратительна настолько, что даже в жанре трэш она является полным провалом. Серьёзно, я хотел начать этот обзор с малочисленных плюсов, но я их тупо не нашёл. Окей, в одном моменте я улыбнулся забавной сцене, можно считать за плюс. Хотя сомнительно, ибо игра в таком жанре должна улыбать гораздо чаще, чем ОДИН раз за всё прохождение. 

Итак, сюжет. События происходят сразу после второй части. Чувак и пёс Чамп приезжают в город Катарсис и внезапно у машины кончается бензин. Главный герой решает заработать денег, поэтому устраивается в порно-магазин, где при помощи пылесоса собирает обконченные салфетки, пока магазин не начнут штурмовать разъярённые мамаши, в которых нужно стрелять этими самыми салфетками. И вот сразу хочу сказать о первой (из 9000) проблеме этой игры. Для этого, сравню её со вторым Посталом, который до сих пор жив и является эталоном жанра трэш. Помните, какие задания были там? Купить молоко, забрать чек, взять автограф, найти ёлку и т.д.. И при этом она нереально весёлая, драйвовая и приятная. Тут же одно уныние, в каждой миссии, в каждой катсцене. Во второй части не было цельного сюжета, что совсем её не портило, а в третей он есть, но он отвратителен даже для жанра, а от бесящей озвучки Куража Бамбея вообще хочется оглохнуть. И даже прикол в не самой озвучке, с ней смириться можно, а вот с разнообразием фраз - простите, но нет. Я сделал комплимент, назвав это безобразие ""разнообразием"". Он может раз пятнадцать за две минуты сказать ""В ГТА физика лучше"", ""Ты наверное удивишься, но я не люблю видеоигры"" и ""Оружие не убивает людей - я убиваю"". Это просто отвратительно, неужели сложно было как-то разнообразить? Или хотя бы сделать их реже? Видимо, очень сложно. 

Но не так сложно, как заставить эту замечательную игру нормально работать. Играешь такой себе, как вдруг начинаются дикие лаги, просто нереальные. Лезешь в центр сообщества, узнаешь, что надо открыть какой-то файл с помощью блокнота и добавить туда некоторые вещи. Делаешь это, заходишь, вроде сработало. И вдруг через пятнадцать секунд понимаешь, что озвучка полетела, и вместо сексуального голоса Куража Бамбея слышишь совсем не сексуальный скрежет. Лезешь в центр сообщества, узнаёшь, что надо открыть консоль и написать некую команду, после которой следует перезапустить игру. Делаешь это и О ЧУДО - можно играть. Правда всё равно будет больно, ибо на сцену выходит геймплей.

О Господи, геймлей третьего Постала! Чтобы так всё запороть, нужно очень постараться. Если стрелять ещё более или менее можно, хоть и неприятно, то ближний бой настолько отвратителен, что того, кто отвечал за него во время разработки нужно запереть в клетке с бешенным барсуком. Реально, настолько ужасного ближнего боя я нигде не видел. Руки, топор, бита, мачете, лопата - всё это бесполезный мусор в этой игре, ибо тупо попасть этим оружием в кого-то сложнее, чем играть в шутеры при помощи сенсорной мышки на ноутбуке. А если и попал, то просто не чувствуешь это, отсутствует так называемый импакт от оружия. Та и стрелять такое себе удовольствие, на самом деле. Базука вообще странная, ибо снаряд взрывается не успев вылететь, что наносит урон только главному герою. Зато, разработчики могут похвастаться тем, что сделали худшую базуку в истории видеоигр. 
И это только оружие, дальше больше. Всё, что связанно с перемещением, сделано так себе. Во время спринта нельзя бежать в бок, укрытия не просто бесполезны, а вредоносны, ибо можно застрять намертво в каком-нибудь горшке. 
Но друзья, всё ещё хуже, ибо пришло время затронуть искусственный интеллект. Враги ведут себя как умственно отсталые идиоты. Поверьте, сейчас я им сделал комплимент, т.к. такого отвратительного ИИ я давно уже не видел. А про отвратительность миссий, в которых кого-то надо сопровождать, я вообще промолчу. 

Стоит затронуть музыку. Она одновременно является и хорошей, и плохой стороной игры, ибо сама по себе музыка неплохая, иногда даже очень клёвая, но она совсем не вписывается в происходящее на экране.

Кстати, в игре даже сломаны ачивки. Мало того, что они скучные нереально, так ещё и некоторые получить честным путём просто невозможно из-за того, что они забагованны. Например, есть достижение ""убить 235 террористов"". Выглядит вполне возможно, ибо есть миссии, где террористов просто дофига. Вот только после прохождения игры, Вы заметете странную вещь - счётчик будет равен 1 из 235. А разгадка проста - по какой-то неведомой причине, за ""террориста"" считается босс-носорог, разукрашенный под корову. Кроме шуток. Не знаю, кто это тестировал, но его нужно уволить, изнасиловать и заставить играть в Постал 3 без патчей со скрипучей озвучкой.

Игру делали русские разработчики под присмотром Running With Scissors (разработчики первых двух частей). Постал 3 стал настолько провальным, что RWS вычеркнули её из канонов серии, а во второй части, за которой они до сих пор следят, можно найти копию игры и насс*ать на неё, за что дадут ачивку.

The truth is though, 5-10-15-20 years it wouldn't have mattered. The problem here isn't lack of development, it's the direction of the development.

All the fluff is there though. Playing this game you will never doubt that this is a Duke game. Scantily clad women are everywhere and you will rarely walk more than ten feet between the various pop culture references, jokes and other nonsense. If anything Gearbox deserves some credit for getting that part of the franchise right. The humor is there, the silliness, the crazy. What they got wrong, is the mechanics.

Playing Duke Nukem Forever is like playing every FPS made in the last 10 years. Gearbox certainly did. They added every cheesy feature the genre has ever experimented with. You got your vehicle sections, your turret sections, your button mashing quick-time events and so on and so forth. Any sense of the fast paced, old school style of FPS that made Duke Nukem 3D the icon it is today is long gone. Instead we have a Duke that's become old and arthritic. This Duke isn't the badass Duke of old. This Duke leans on stamina bars, regenerating health, limited weapon slots, scripted events and linear maps.

Instead of the sprawling maps of Duke 3D, that had you running, jumping, flying and swimming all over the place, looking for secrets and keycards you play through entirely linear and fully scripted sequences and fights you do not allow you to progress until you've killed what the game wants you to kill and listened to whatever irrelevant dialog the game wants you to listen to. The entire experience is slow and dull and there is little to look forward to besides the naked ladies and the occasional proper joke.

Duke Nukem 3D was a masterpiece of adolescent insanity, of old school fast paced shooting, of innovative map design. Duke Nukem Forever has captured the adolescent part but lost everything else in the shuffle. What's left is a mediocre shooter with a bunch of nudes thrown around.

Duke Nukem Forever is not a very good game. It's a game that doesn't stay true to it's old school roots doesn't even compare to the original. Even by modern standards it brings nothing new to the table, just a bunch of rehashed concepts and ideas. Nothing is new, nothing is better than what's been already done.

All in all. For those that have been waiting, hoping for a good old school style shooter, this ain't it. And for those that just want a decent modern shooter to pass the time, this ain't it either. They might get the crude humor right but everything else, just ain't Duke.","Duke Nukem Forever. 15 years in the making and yet here I am, considering if it couldn't have used a couple of more years in development.

I do not support RWS as one of their employees named PEDRO SANTOS doxxed me ON THE DARK WEB after kicking me out of their discord. I also reached out to MIKE JARRET who laughed about it. I will never support this company ever again.

This game HAS SO  MANY BUGSbut the brabching story is hillarious along with the dialouge. I praise the story but other than that this game feels like a xbox 1 game @ time graphically. I love postal though so its OK. I give it a 6/10.

But still even if RWS wants to act like this one didnt happen at least go in for corey cruise. The man does his job well.","Update: 2024

ok so this game is based on current world issues and stuff and just makes fun of stereotypes and can be offensive and has been really contraversial for ever, like since 1997, and if you arnt a baby its incredibly fun. this is not as good as the first 2 seeing as it was made by a different studieo but its still a good time. not great but ok.its fun if your super bored but Postal 2 is way better.this is like a spin off, even rws says so.

[b]Postal III didn’t turn out how RWS had hoped.
The original plan was for RWS to do game design and style art, with Akella responsible for production (coding, game art, audio, playtesting, etc.). The project started out great with both groups working close together, then the first blow came with the Russian economy taking a hit and Akella lost their A development team and the project got moved to Team B. Looking back now we should have canceled the project then as there was no way the new less qualified team was going to be able to deliver a “A” quality game. The next big blow was when Akella started chopping away at our design (to accommodate the limited skills of the 2nd string team), this only got worse over time. From eliminating gameplay to single player only to PC only and scratching consoles. The hole kept getting deeper and the shit shovel was in full force. We didn't even get to see or play the game in the last 12 months of development, then the worst thing happened. Akella was desperate for money trying to prevent going out of business. They made the fatal decision to ‘wrap it up’ at alpha and call it done, releasing it to the Russian market, then on Steam for the international market.

Akella retains control of all the source code and assets for Postal III which they will not share with us or the modding community, so we are unable to fix Postal III ourselves, leaving a flawed and unfinished game. RWS also do not profit from Postal III sales and we stopped selling it ourselves the moment it was clear we would be unable to support the product.

Postal III is not without some redeeming features for fans of POSTAL: graphically it looks nice, the cutscene art and music was decent and it has some interesting unique weapons such as the Badger Saw. The branching storyline and Good versus Bad system allows you to replay the game and encounter new levels, alternative scenes and it even allows you to complete the objectives differently. The game at least knows it’s a train wreck and will often make fun of itself during the objective screens.[/b]","[h1] Buy POSTAL 4 you shmucks [/h1]

Would rate if worked for at least an hour without severe game breaking issues, avoid at all costs, give money to RWS via their store and buy Postal II + DLC, not the idiots that made this using licensing of the ip, they want shooting, with a cat silenced shotgun.","Take one small american town, throw in some insanity and a dash of ridiculously crude and offensive humour, Take 1x Postal II, remove all the good bits, feed them into an LSD trip, then pipe the remains out on to a baking tray, have a bunch of half educated blind russians have a look at it for an hour, then proceed to bake at medium heat for 2 years, turning through out.
