It is quite a shame as this was one of the DF-like games that all came out around the same time (Gnomoria is another one that comes to mind, which although also abandoned, is a lot more feature-complete than this). This isn't as bad as Spacebase DF-9 in terms of abandonment, but pretty close.

If you're interested in this game, rather look at Dwarf Fortress, Rimworld, Songs of Syx or Oxygen Not Included (depending on what part interested you the most), and you'll be much happier.","The game had a lot of potential when it first came out, and although it was quite buggy, you could see the direction it was going.

A very old early access game, abandoned, unfinished, but there was still a lot there for replay-ability for its time.

I kind of feel obligated to leave a kind review because I think the hate is a bit unwarranted. I think Banished was similarly sort of abandoned without much features besides a bare-bones city builder framework that today would be looked at as hollow and soulless, yet that game was lauded because it was seen as more casual for its time.

While I don't think the price is warranted anymore, if it were $1-3 or maybe $5 max then it would still represent a cheap game to have fun for a few hours or more if you get into it.","I loved this game, I still think of it sometimes fondly and wonder what could of been.

There are lots of different ways to do things from food production to weapon/armor creation to building.  I would recommend giving it a try if you like city builders and citizen indirect management.

Its sad to me that most of the negative reviews are about it being abandoned and/or unfinished.  Those have no relevance on the game-play or mechanics that make it good or bad.  Unfortunately it didn't do well enough for the developer to keep working on it which is sad because it could be a great game once finished and polished.  Sure there are bugs and issues, some pretty big, but looking past that there are a lot of fun things about the game that were there from the beginning:

[list]
	[*]You control the townies by telling them what to build.  They build them in a semi random order determined by the game.  You can control the order of different categories of actions.  You can also group townies separately and assign them sub actions that they focus on, and ignore the rest.  You can totally mess up the production line and kill half of your town because they starve to death haha.  This also applies to soldiers which have various options on how to patrol or guard the barracks they are assigned to.
	[*]Various food production options with pros and cons.  Some affect happiness, some take a lot of space, some have a lot of steps to make, others are plain and quick.  I recently spent many hours going through the food mechanics and trying various options out to figure out which ones scale better or not.  It was fun to dive in and use a spreadsheet to track everything.
	[*]Numerous options for creating armor/weapons.  They do scale as you get more items from going further down in the dungeon.  Which makes exploring the dungeon essential to create better gear.  There are also vanity options which make the townies happier, which attract more townies.
	[*]There are heroes you can attract by meeting certain conditions in the game.  Some of them really make you think outside the box and set up something in a way you normally wouldn't do.  They explore the dungeon for you so you can go back and mine ores and stone.
	[*]The happiness mechanic is unique, haven't seen anything like it.  You have to plan out your build design to keep them happy so as they are working they stay happy.  Otherwise you run them into the ground and don't go anywhere.  There are decorations you have to place down fairly close together so the townies ""see"" them and gain happiness.
	[*]The monsters can come from the dungeon or from sieges (which you can turn on or off).  But it allows you to plan out your city with walls and funnel the enemies through a barracks to kill them.  There are also traps you can use, possibly in a maze design, to kill the monsters.  There are different difficulties of the sieges to try out.
	[*]There are several different kinds of maps with different resources available to you at the beginning.  Some are harder to start with than others so it makes it more challenging and fun to try different maps.  Every map is random so the replay is great.  
	[*]Lots of block types for building.  Having a roof overhead does make them happier.  Various themed or environmental building can be created.  Many of the initial pictures of the game show lots of these options.  You have to build temp blocks so the townies can get to all the locations to build more blocks.  Its possible to trap townies that will then starve to death if you don't rescue them.
[/list]

For me I am not that creative.  So I didn't explore all the various ways to create awesome looking buildings.  I dove into the mechanics to figure out how to grow the town faster and which food options were better and which weapons/armor to use at the beginning.  
Some of the map variants gave the better food options right at the beginning, others were generated with the enemies right in the way of the resources and so it made it challenging right from the start.

There is definitely replay-ability built into the game.  I still do pick it up from time to time to start a new map and see where it goes.

On the surface it might look like a typical drawn/pixel art city builder where you manage and instruct villagers to harvest resources, plant crops, raise animals, trade with wandering merchants, build structures, craft tools and weapons while trying not to starve to death or get wiped out by monsters that live on the surface and in the dungeon levels below.

The part that really captured my attention and held my interest was the mechanic that allows the player to construct a residence with certain attributes used to attract different types of wandering heroes who will stay in your town and defend it from threats (several different types with their own abilities and stats).  The longer you keep them happy the better chances you have of keeping them around, gearing them up and watching them faceroll your enemies.  The more heroes you attract, the better their chances of not getting killed off.  To spice things up a bit, these heroes are never under your direct control.

Overall, the farther these heroes and your guards clear the dungeons, the better the loot and resources you have access to but also the more dangerous the enemies and raids can become.  So it can be a delicate balance in terms of when to expand and when to ""wall off"" new areas.

It can be both a fun and frustrating experience trying to figure out how to best attract and keep the heroes as well as lay down the infrastructure to maximize their effectiveness.  In the end, it's a fairly satisfying experience.

[spoiler]Honestly, if someone remastered this game and ""finished"" it, it'd be an instant hit on Steam even by 2024 colony sim standards.  After all, despite it being more than 10 years ago, there still aren't any games I know of that have repeated this specific formula (i.e. a multi-level map/game world where the player is constructing a city or colony to attract autonomous AI NPCs that the player needs but can't directly control).[/spoiler]","Easily one of the best abandoned ""Mostly Negative"" games still available to buy on Steam when it comes to sandbox city builder/colony simulators.

if you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding carrot cake recipe you've come to the right place.

Ingredients

230ml vegetable oil, plus extra for the tin
100g natural yogurt
4 large eggs
1½ tsp vanilla extract
½ orange, zested
265g self-raising flour
335g light muscovado sugar
2½ tsp ground cinnamon
¼ fresh nutmeg, finely grated
265g carrots (about 3), grated
100g sultanas or raisins
100g walnuts or pecans, roughly chopped (optional)
For the icing
100g slightly salted butter, softened
300g icing sugar
100g soft cheese

Directions

STEP 1
Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Oil and line the base and sides of two 20cm cake tins with baking parchment. Whisk the oil, yogurt, eggs, vanilla and zest in a jug. Mix the flour, sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg with a good pinch of salt in a bowl. Squeeze any lumps of sugar through your fingers, shaking the bowl a few times to bring the lumps to the surface.

STEP 2
Add the wet ingredients to the dry, along with the carrots, raisins and half the nuts, if using. Mix well to combine, then divide between the tins.

STEP 3
Bake for 25-30 mins or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. If any wet mixture clings to the skewer, return to the oven for 5 mins, then check again. Leave to cool in the tins.

STEP 4
To make the icing, beat the butter and sugar together until smooth. Add half the soft cheese and beat again, then add the rest (adding it bit by bit prevents the icing from splitting). Remove the cakes from the tins and sandwich together with half the icing. Top with the remaining icing and scatter with the remaining walnuts. Will keep in the fridge for up to five days. Best eaten at room temperature.

Tip:
top this classic carrot cake with moreish icing and chopped walnuts or pecans. Serve as a sweet treat with a cup of tea any time of the day.","Easy carrot cake

Концепция непрямого управления (именно как в Majesty) довольно редкая механика, и таких игр раз два и обчелся, поэтому кому нравится такой жанр, я считаю, однозначно стоит попробовать поиграть. Просто надо быть готовым, что не все сразу будет понятно, и придется начинать заново несколько раз, прежде чем сможете справляться не только с балансом, но и тотальными багами (например, помню было что-то вроде бага, когда несмотря на наличие еды жители все-равно массово дохли от голода, но даже с этим багом можно было как-то справиться игровым путем). 

И все же, несмотря на сложность освоения, сырость и баги, игра смогла удержать мой интерес, судя по стиму, аж на 60 часов, которые точно не были скучными, а на такое способна далеко не каждая игра, поэтому рекомендую.","The game was criticized for its bugs and overall lack of polish that will never be fixed, but even though several years have passed since I last played it, I still remember it as a rather interesting example of the genre, where, in addition to developing your city and its inhabitants, you also have visiting heroes who can't be directly controlled and who go about their business on their own.

The concept of indirect control (like in Majesty) is a rather rare mechanic, and games like it are few and far between, so I think it's definitely worth a try for anyone who enjoys this genre. You just have to be prepared that not everything will be immediately clear, and you'll have to start over several times before you can master not only the balance but also the pervasive bugs (for example, I remember there was a bug where, despite having food, citizens still died en masse of starvation, but even this bug could be somehow overcome through gameplay).

And yet, despite the difficulty of mastering, the rawness and bugs, the game managed to hold my interest, judging by Steam, for as long as 60 hours, which were definitely not boring, and not every game is capable of this, so I recommend it."

I've seen that it's not supported anymore, but I have yet to find a good 3D town building simulator that gives a similar experience. I've seen Rim World and such, but they don't generally feel the same to me.

That said, there is a bit of a learning curve to get everything working smoothly. Right off that bat, there is a need to get the automated crafting set up to keep your townies fed. This is done via the menu on the left of the screen. This works better if you've created job categories with specific tasks to allow your assigned townies to specialize. Once you get your auto crafting set up and your townies organized, it helps to know that there is a minimum level option in the townie menu to keep your townies from going too deep and getting into potentially fatal encounters. Once you've got the hang of those features, keeping townies alive and happier becomes a lot easier.

That said, it does need some modifications to make it more enjoyable. There are .xml files in the game folder that allow the game to be modified to some extent. By default, as you get down to lower levels of the dungeon, you'll see your townies slowing down because they are tired and ultimately starving to death as they wind their way through a labyrinth of passages despite being moments away from starvation. This can be alleviated by hand-editing an XML file to increase the time before they get tired or hungry, and can make the game significantly more enjoyable due to some issues with the townie AI, and for me is completely necessary to enjoy the game more. If you want more variability, the format is along the lines of 2000 + 1d200, where the 1d200 generates a random value between 0-200. So you can somewhat randomize your townies to get some winners and losers.

On an older computer, I have also noticed significant lag as my townie count got closer to 60. Bringing the game to a near crawl.

Overall, I would personally recommend getting the game if it's on sale as a relatively relaxed time killer.","Every now and then I'll come back to this game when I want a good chill building and management game.

ОБЗОР спустя 25 часов игры:

первый минус: житель может застрять в постройке или в подземелье и умереть от голода (при наличии еды на складе)... как исправить: ставим галочку АВТОСЕЙВ начала дня... и переигрываем день освобождая дорогу убирая блок или строя ступеньки из блоков в подземелье!

второй минус: жители любят закончить крышу и остаться на ней умирать от голода... решение: рядом строим леса (вровень с крышей) и он по ним спускается...

Если сделать упор на доспехи и оружие (железо и кости есть), то вся местная флора/фауна не страшна!!! (необходимости в заборах нету)))

хардкор как раз вот в чём: чтобы найти железо и уголь придётся всё перерыть!!! (...мне ""повезло"" на моей карте нашлось много железа, но угля вообще нет... и как крафтить его, так и не понятно)

ОБЗОР спустя 15 часов игры:

Игра интересна! Без разных сейвов (один перезаписывается), так что переиграть ошибку не получиться (разве что сохранять из папки)... За 15 часов меняешь стратегию развития несколько раз! На 10 час осталось только пятеро поселенцев (но поселение оставлять не хочется) И о Карл!!! Как я забыл про доспехи с оружием (здесь тебе не мирная ферма) ВСЕМ БРОНЮ И ""СТВОЛЫ""))) ...понеслась!!! теперь счастье зашкаливает и бегут ко мне мои любимые новые поселенцы))) старые, закалённые в кулачных боях, вообще всех рвут в доспехах с оружием)))

ОБЗОР после 2 часов игры: 

Русификатор для последней версии можно найти в ВК (может позже руководство сделаю), переведено всё, кроме туториала... (может на поздней игре тоже, пока я в начале)
игра весит 25мб))) (пришлось поставить Яву, автоматически винда 10 поставила и работает)
Думаю игра пойдёт на любом ПК (наверно на калькуляторе тоже, ЛОЛ) 
Туториал очень подробный и понятный (придётся переводить, но оно того стоит)
Интерфейс очень удобный и наглядный (иконки ко всем действиям)

РАЗРАБОТЧИК ВЕРНИСЬ!!!

пс: на распродаже взял за 142руб., - это просто даром (уже 2 часа наиграл), кто меня за такие деньги будет 2-а часа развлекать???))) Я думаю наиграть часов 10 ещё и продолжить обзор!!!","The game is fantastic for its genre!

REVIEW after 25 hours of play:

First drawback: a villager can get stuck in a building or a dungeon and die of hunger (if there's food in the warehouse)... How to fix: check the AUTOSAVE box at the start of the day... and replay the day, clearing a path by removing a block or building steps from blocks into the dungeon!

Second drawback: villagers like to finish building a roof and end up dying of hunger... Solution: build scaffolding nearby (level with the roof) and let them climb down...

If you focus on armor and weapons (there's iron and bones), then all the local flora and fauna won't be a problem!!! (There's no need for fences)))

Hardcore is precisely this: to find iron and coal, you'll have to dig everything!!! (...I was ""lucky"" enough to find a lot of iron on my map, but no coal at all... and I still don't know how to craft it.)

REVIEW after 15 hours of play:

The game is fun! No multiple saves (one gets overwritten), so there's no way to replay the error (unless you save from a folder)... Over the course of 15 hours, you change your strategy several times! By the 10th hour, there are only five settlers left (but I don't want to abandon the settlement). And oh, Karl!!! How did I forget about armor and weapons (this isn't a peaceful farm). ARMOR AND GUN GUNS FOR EVERYONE))) ...here we go!!! Now my happiness is off the charts and my favorite new settlers are running towards me))) The old ones, seasoned in fistfights, are tearing everyone apart in armor and weapons)))

REVIEW after 2 hours of play:

The Russian translation for the latest version can be found on VK (maybe I'll make a guide later), everything is translated except the tutorial... (maybe in the late game too, while I'm at the beginning)
The game weighs 25 MB))) (I had to install Java, but Windows 10 installed it automatically and it works)
I think the game will run on any PC (probably on a calculator too, lol)
The tutorial is very detailed and clear (it will have to be translated, but it's worth it)
The interface is very user-friendly and intuitive (icons for all actions)

DEVELOPER, COME BACK!!!

P.S.: I got it on sale for 142 rubles - it's just a gift (I've already played it for 2 hours). Who would entertain me for 2 hours for that kind of money???))) I'm thinking of playing for another 10 hours and then continuing the review!!!"

Can't really manage them directly so nothing I could do to keep them from suiciding like that. Still played it for 81 hours before I expanded to the point that it became a major problem. So I can't really say it's not worth the modest price.

Das Spiel ist schön simpel und das was es soll macht es relativ gut. Ich hatte hier viel Spaß und fang auch immer noch ab und zu gerne eine neue Karte an und probiere andere Spielweisen aus.

Man muss dazu sagen, dass das Spiel wohl nur als Anfäger schwierig ist, bis man weiß was zu tun ist. In etwa wie bei Banished. Der Survivalanteil ist da noch zu spüren^^
Ansonsten wird es mit laufender Tiefe des Dungeons immer schwieriger, so dass man sich später doch einiges einfallen lassen muss, damit die eigene Bevölkerung nicht abgeschlachtet wird. Da man aber selbst entscheiden kann, ob man weiter gaben will, kann man sich doch lange Zeit sehr gut auf das nächste Level vorbereiten und die Spielschwierigkeit ist damit auch für jeden selbst anpassbar.

Wer mal ""Minecraft"" (gibt natürlich sehr viele Unterschiede) als Strategie-Survival-Spiel ausprobieren möchte ist hier richtig. Vielleicht bis die anderen Early-Access-Titel endlich spielbar sind ;)
GL & HF","It's a shame that this game isn't being developed further and that there are still a few bugs, but I still don't think that's a reason for a negative rating.
The game is nice and simple and does what it's supposed to do relatively well. I had a lot of fun with it and still enjoy starting a new map every now and then and trying out different playstyles.

I have to say that the game is probably only difficult for beginners until you know what to do. Kind of like Banished. The survival element is still noticeable there.^^
Otherwise, it gets increasingly difficult as you delve deeper into the dungeon, so you'll have to come up with some ideas later on to avoid slaughtering your own population. However, since you can decide for yourself whether you want to continue playing, you can prepare yourself for the next level for a long time, and the difficulty is also adjustable for everyone.

If you want to try out ""Minecraft"" (there are, of course, many differences) as a strategy survival game, this is the right place for you. Maybe until the other Early Access titles are finally playable ;)

I enjoyed this.  Quite a lot.  I really don't understand the hate for people claiming this is 'unfinished'.  Yep, it is true that this project did not reach the full set of goals the original developer set out, but that doesn't change the fact that the game is pretty cool, and has plenty of play in it.  

Is it ground-breakingly different or new?  Not really.  Is it a totally different take on the genre?  Again, not really.  But it does fit the niche for building some buildings, farming some stuff, killing some mobs, and looting some treasures.  And while you are doing that, it is a pretty involved and good experience with just enough depth in it to make it feel like you are developing your community and bonding with the toons.

I reckon if there was no 'beta/greenlight/whatever' tag associated with this, and someone just marketed it as a 'lightweight town builder with dungeon elements' then I think people would shut the heck up about abandonware and realise it has easily enough weight in it to be released as a standalone indy-developed product that is really rather enjoyable.

The story is a liiiiiiiiiiittle bit more complicated than that -- unfortunately, most of the original explanations and discussion are lost (they were posted on the now-defunct Towns Community Forums on the original website, which was shut down and now redirects to the Steam store page)

A summary of some of those extra factors:

- at the time, Steam's Project: Greenlight was in its infancy, and wasn't well defined. ""Early Access"" didn't exist yet, although the concept was being thrown around -- many devs from the first few waves of Greenlight were under the impression that Greenlight itself was going to be set up to support the type of games that would become Early Access titles. Unfortunately, this wasn't what Valve ultimately went with; so for the first couple of years the games that got voted up through Greenlight were put under immense pressure to rush to a ""minimum viable product"" -- and Towns, as one of the titles in the first batch of Greenlight releases, was going into uncharted territory with a changing Steam marketplace.

- it's worth noting that in those days, Steam itself was very different -- you had to know someone at Valve to even start the discussions about getting onto the Steam platform, and games that did get released on Steam typically sold quite well. Back when Towns released into the Steam Store, there were less than 1000 titles available for purchase on Steam; a far cry from today! In those days, Valve had a reputation for being more hands-on, offering support with releases and with things like community management. So, where the Towns dev team expected to get a bit more support from the Greenlight program, they were unfortunately left to their own devices to handle the influx of new players (many of whom had no familiarity with the state of the game.)

- As part of celebrating the first wave of Greenlight releases, Towns was put into a much-advertised sale; it was quickly followed up with the Steam Summer Sale and then a third ""best of the year"" encore sale -- so while there were many many copies sold right after the game launched, the actual revenue was much lower than most people assumed. I remember outrageous figures like $3-4 million being thrown around, with no accounting for tax or Steam's cut or the fact that the devs had significant expenses to cover (e.g. the cost of all the legal services, accounting, and similar paperwork required to run a game studio; running the game website and forum; upgrading computers and software licenses)... that's all before anything the devs actually got to take home. I know that Supermalparit did eventually post a statement regarding the actual income Towns made from that first Steam Store check, and it was a little less than $1 million by the time it hit the studio accounts. It's also worth noting that Steam pays out revenue on a 3 monthly cycle, so the devs didn't even see any of that income during the sales -- it landed in their accounts months afterwards.

- On top of all that stuff on the business side of things (which, remember, Ben and Xavi had to handle all of that communications + paperwork + etc themselves; they didn't have a business developer or admin to take care of it), there was also a lot going on in their personal lives at the time. Xavi in particular is very private about that side of the story, so I'll respect that privacy, but suffice to say that he took on a whole full-time caring role for his wife and children during that period. Ben (Burningpet) similarly took some long-overdue time to focus on his family following the release of the game on Steam -- in effect, that milestone was the end of a years-long sprint; under the belief as previously discussed that Valve would step up to help handle things like monitoring and moderating the Steam community forum during this break. So, when that support didn't materialise, Xavi and Ben also had to take on the extra workload of trying to answer a deluge of questions, criticisms and in some cases outright accusations, while trying to juggle both the business side of game development, the actual game dev work, and looking after their families.

So, with all of that going on, the vitriol coming at them from certain loud corners of the Steam community had a much larger effect than it otherwise would -- not just emotionally; it also added extra (urgent) work that further delayed the other important stuff on the to-do list. And, in the most unfortunate irony of the whole story, that vitriol ended up having a direct negative impact on the game's marketability and made it much harder for the devs to get support to turn things around -- when they tried to bring on Moebius to help out with the dev work, the sheer amount of work required to repair the game's image (coupled with the fact that sales had dropped away to basically nothing since everyone had already bought a copy during the Steam sales) made Towns a commercially risky prospect and Moebius ultimately couldn't go through with the deal. I know that Moebius wasn't the only dev that Ben and Xavi approached to join the Towns team; I don't believe that any of the other attempts weren't even announced (there are a couple I know of because of conversations with Xavi after-the-fact, and one where I actually fielded an initial inquiry and helped get the person in contact with Xavi so they could discuss the idea) but ultimately the major hurdle in all cases was that there was no ""runway"" left -- any new dev would be jumping straight into the fire, and would need to make major additions and improvements immediately as well as fielding a whole new round of heat for stuff they had nothing to do with. And when that was the job description, without guarantee of future success and with an already strained budget... I can't blame any of those other devs for deciding it was too risky. 

Finally, it's worth noting that even after all this, Xavi and Ben returned to work on half a dozen more updates and bring in major features (water system, buried towns, new event mechanics, and a largely under-utilised 'gods' system which honestly could have been amazing when coupled with the events if only there had been an opportunity to flesh it out properly) -- of those features, the dynamic water system was the first time that any city-building game had attempted anything like that in decades, and the gods and events system (really it's 1 linked system with multiple facets) is still impressive compared to its modern comparisons. Messing around with the gods and events through mods, it allowed for some amazing possibilities -- re-shaping the map, changing up the whole game... one of the janky prototypes I created was ""seasons"" where it literally changed the grass terrain to snow terrain and then back again over the course of the year, as well as 'sprouting' new trees and plants in spring, and creating floods in summer. If the devs had been able to work on those systems the way that they envisioned, I am confident that Towns would rival its much later/more modern genre companions in terms of interactivity, dynamism and 'living world' feeling.

Yes, words do matter and the harsh words levelled at Towns did have a visible and lasting impact. But it's not [i]just[/i] the words that mattered here -- ultimately, there were pre-existing factors outside the devs' control. The harsh words served to make an already difficult situation even worse, and bump it from 'extremely difficult' to 'commercially untenable to continue.'","This review is now for all of those that came in just to leave a negative review and scream: ""Abandonded!""

I bought into this game during its early access state, sometime in alpha 13 I believe. During that time, I was big into Dwarf Forttress like games that had more graphics, and this game was amazing in that regard. A mixture of minecraft style view with dwarf fortress rouge-like hardness; the game was a shoo-in to take the market in my opinion.

Sometime after alpha 14, the game's dev simply stopped updating it all together. SInce then, the game has been abandoned.

I believe this game still has some potential as both a learning tool and a testimate; a testimate that such games are necessairy to bring hope and inovation to our industry. So please, don't review this game as being terrible becasue its incomplete, or unbalanced; review it as learning-game, one that was used to learn how to fail faster (make mistakes so you don't do it again), and how to make more awesome games.","This game had Potential.

Aber deswegen das Spiel negativ zu bewerten ist Unsinn. Das Spiel selbst ist nicht perfekt (auch technisch gibt es Mängel), aber es macht verdammt viel Spaß es zu spielen. Daran messe ich dann auch ein Spiel, dass ist ja der Sinn des Ganzen - Unterhalten werden.
In der Hinsicht sind die negativen Reviews größtenteils kompletter Müll. Das Spiel ist super und ich habe für mein Geld ne Menge geboten bekommen. Die Spielmechaniken sind durchaus anspruchsvoll und bei Reviews unter 10h halte ich es persönlich für sehr unwahrscheinlich, dass man das Spiel dann tatsächlich bewerten kann.
Übrigens ist das Spiel kein ""Early Access"". Es wurde mittels Greenlight von Steam unterstützt, veröffentlicht und dann zwei Jahre betrieben.","Towns is still a brilliant game. It'll probably never be more than it is now - okay. But to rate the game negatively because of that is nonsense. The game itself isn't perfect (there are also technical flaws), but it's a hell of a lot of fun to play. That's how I measure a game; that's the whole point of the whole thing - to be entertained.
In that respect, the negative reviews are mostly complete garbage. The game is great, and I got a lot for my money. The game mechanics are quite challenging, and with reviews under 10 hours, I personally think it's very unlikely that you can actually rate the game.
By the way, the game isn't in ""Early Access."" It was supported, released, and then operated via Steam Greenlight for two years."

möbel wie betten bringen wohl garnichts und werden nicht benutzt,

Resource consumption, especially food consumption, is far too high.

You can't assign which tasks an NPC should perform; you can only block certain ones.

No real AI. You have to assign each individual action each time.

In other words, if someone is supposed to chop down a tree, you have to mark each tree individually.

No automation for resource mining.

So far, I haven't been able to figure out how to craft tools and clothing, or get raw materials like flintstone or iron. These are necessary, though, so people don't just drop dead like flies.

Once they're dead, no new ones appear.

Doors are always placed in the same place and can't be turned.

Всё необходимое для этого у неё, в общем-то, есть: куча горожан, которые занимаются своими делами, но выполняют поставленные приказы, куча разнообразных монстров, строительство помещений, которое делает тебя сильнее, инвентарь у каждого персонажа...

Замечу также, что ещё тут есть продуманная ""цепная"" экономика (для изготовления топора, например, нужно обработанное дерево и сталь, которые соединяются на станке. А для этого надо сначала нарубить дерева, добыть железную руду и переплавить её в сталь). Есть подземелье с монстрами (они не респаунятся, так что зачистка возможна - и часто необходима). Есть атаки рейдеров. Есть разные условия, чтобы к тебе приходили разные герои (например, герои-гномы приходят только в таверну, расположенную под землёй). Даже странствующие торговцы периодически наведываются.

В общем, тут много чего есть... но у автора случился нервный срыв буквально за пару месяцев до окончания производства. В итоге игру он бросил и не вернулся никогда, так что тут хватает глупых недоловленных багов и нет ""склейки"", которая бы сделала из песочницы нормальную игру: отсутствуют квесты, разные карты (ну, если не начинать игру с нуля, конечно) и нет сюжета.

Поэтому, как вы можете видеть, игра имеет крайне негативные обзоры. И зря. Если не ждать от неё невозможного, она довольно симпатична. Любителям повозиться с экономикой - рекомендую.","This game could be Majesty's answer. It basically has everything it needs: tons of townspeople who go about their business but follow orders, a variety of monsters, building structures that make you stronger, and an inventory for each character...

I'll also note that it has a well-thought-out ""chain"" economy (to craft an axe, for example, you need processed wood and steel, which are combined at a workbench. To do this, you first need to chop wood, mine iron ore, and smelt it into steel). There's a dungeon with monsters (they don't respawn, so clearing them is possible—and often necessary). There are raider attacks. There are different conditions for different heroes to come to you (for example, dwarven heroes only come to the tavern located underground). Even traveling merchants drop in periodically.

Overall, there's a lot going on here... but the author had a nervous breakdown literally a couple of months before production ended. He ended up abandoning the game and never came back, so there are plenty of silly, unresolved bugs and no ""glue"" to make a proper sandbox game: there are no quests, no different maps (well, unless you start from scratch, of course), and no story.

So, as you can see, the game has received extremely negative reviews. And that's a shame. If you don't expect the impossible, it's quite enjoyable. I recommend it to those who enjoy tinkering with the economy."

Mir persönlich macht es immer wieder Spaß, eine neue Siedlung hochzuziehen, Farmen anzulegen, Material zu sammeln, die Bewohner auszurüsten, Helden anzulocken und Höhlen zu buddeln, um Eisen, Kohle usw zu finden. Mir gefällt auch das Micromanagement - bestimmte Bewohner bestimmten Aufgaben zuzuweisen und so dafür zu sorgen, dass immer genug Nahrung da ist und Bau- und Buddeltrupps zur Verfügung stehen, um alle Minen zu graben. Sind die Bewohner glücklich, erscheinen neue Dörfler, vorausgesetzt, man hat genug Räume für sie hergerichtet. Ich habe auch gelesen, dass der bzw. die Entwickler aufgehört haben, das Spiel zu entwickeln, allerdings habe ich bisher noch keine fiesen Bugs und/ oder Abstürze bemerkt. Meiner Meinung nach ist das Spiel so absolut spielbar und macht irgendwie ein wenig süchtig. Ich habe bei meinem aktuellen Spiel ziemlich lange nach Kohle suchen müssen, damit ich ein Gebäude bauen kann, dass auf Eisen paltziert, automatisch Eisen auswirft. Aber bis ich die Kohle hatte, vergingen einige Grabungen und Dungeons :)","I've been playing this game on and off for a few years now. Personally, I always enjoy building a new settlement, establishing farms, gathering materials, equipping the inhabitants, attracting heroes, and digging caves to find iron, coal, etc. I also enjoy the micromanagement—assigning specific inhabitants to specific tasks, ensuring there's always enough food and construction and digging crews available to dig all the mines. If the inhabitants are happy, new villagers appear, provided you've prepared enough rooms for them. I also read that the developer(s) have stopped developing the game, but I haven't noticed any nasty bugs and/or crashes yet. In my opinion, the game is perfectly playable and somewhat addictive. In my current game, I had to spend quite a long time searching for coal so I could build a building that, when placed on iron, automatically ejects iron. But it took a lot of digging and dungeon-building before I got the coal :)"

But, i have played the ggame for around 111 hours, and still have not gotten close to finishing a game. I Self tought myself from my failures, and still love this game. Learning about the game from Old Sips playthroughs, i could still recommend Towns, because its still fun. Sure its not going to be updated any further. But its a nice break from the more advanced Prison Arch. and Rimworld, etc. etc.. It adds the difficulty that  like. Now thi coming from somebodys thats been with the game for years, and particurly likes the genre, and feel. If you love these types of games, you can still get some fun out of it. Though if your deciding between this game or one thats still updating, and can only choose one. Well thats obvious. But hey spare money. Do it.","So, Towns, as the game is no longer in development.

I hope and pray that some one suffers with a change of heart as to where the game is concerned as this could have been one heck of a game. Purchase at your own risk... personally since the developement has been abandoned the game should not cost £9.99 if anything it should be £1.99. why pay full retail in to the pockets of some one that cant even be bothered to finish.. again really wishsome one could pick up where the original lazy butts left off.

Towns might have been the first Early Access game I've ever bought and it made me skeptical and wary of all future Early Access titles. It has a great premise that is executed poorly and although you might have a bit of fun with it for a few hours, there is little here to recommend an indepth playthrough.

I don't mind isometric, retroish graphics but these are, more often than not, absolutely annoying to look at. Towns has gone for a sort of Populus/Simcity kind of look, all graphical tilesets and while I think some of it works, particularly outside of the Town in the woods and forest, it often just looks totally ugly. There's no definition or clear sense of layering; what lies in front of things and behind other things can be really hard to tell. When you do have a Town, it all runs together and looks like someone who just found out they can download Final Fantasy sprites and has mashed them all together. Certain textures really grate on the eyes, particularly the water texture which you see a lot of.

Controlling this game isn't much better as the inteface is awful.  I've played a lot of games with clunky interfaces and struggled my way through them but this might be one of the worst. Absolutely nothing about it works properly; you'll probably have to hit every key on the keyboard to figure out what does what and even then, attempting to divine the systems that control anything in this game is like trying to scry the future or turn lead into gold. 

Towns had a lot of potential for growth (with a bad launch, but hey, potential?) - I mean, running a town built over a dungeon and attracting heroes, managing the enemies that come out, building the town up with facilities for the adventurers? It sounds like a perfect blend of Recettear, Diablo and Dungeon Keeper. But this is not that; Towns is a shoddy, abandoned game with very little to recommend it. It usually comes on sale for 7.49, discounted down from 14.99. It is not worth playing at either price and the fact they want you to pay $15 dollars for an abandoned game is repulsive. You shouldn't be paying for abandonware - speak with your wallet and say no to Towns.

NOTE: Steam shows 0.1 hours on record but I know for a fact I played at least a day of this - it felt longer, honestly, but trust me you don't need a whole day to see the flaws in this one.","Before you read any further: this game has been abandoned.

Mais il faut voir plus loin que ça, et non pas seulement le fait qu'il a été abandonné, et que les développeurs sont ''partis avec notre argent.'' Non. Il y a une histoire derrière ce scandale, scandale qui sera d'ailleurs devenu avec le temps un cas d'école, du moins dans sa face externe: celle du jeu indépendant qui ne sera jamais abouti et dont les joueurs payants auront été floués et jamais remboursés.

Mais il faut se pencher sur l'histoire de Towns. Car Towns a été un pilier. Effectivement, il a été un cas d'école, mais pour beaucoup plus que ce qu'il a créé en surface.
Raconter tout cela en détails serait trop long, aussi j'exhorterai tous ceux qui liront cet avis à s'y pencher. Lisez des articles, apprenez ce qu'il s'est passé. Towns aura été pour moi une belle expérience d'une quelque dizaine d'heures, mais une expérience forte, parce que la musique, parce que le contexte, parce que son histoire en tant que jeu et qu'aventure vécue par les développeurs. 

Towns fait partie de l'histoire du jeu indépendant, au même titre que Braid, Super Meat Boy, Machinarium, et tous ceux qui pourraient nous venir en tête. Mais il en fait partie pour une raison différente: Towns n'a peut être pas été un succès colossal, hissant ses créateurs au statut de dieux intouchables, mais il a eu un rôle beaucoup plus important: celui d'explorateur, celui de pionnier. Le rôle malheureux de l'exemple à ne pas suivre, le ''rôle du con.'' Est ce que je regrette d'avoir acheté ce jeu aussi cher ? Je ne pense pas. Parce que Towns me laissera des souvenirs de joueurs indélébiles, parce que j'ai vécu son histoire en tant que joueur impliqué directement.

Je tiens tout de même à remercier les trois membres de l'équipe SMP, qui malgré tout ont fait de leur mieux et se sont malheureusement retrouvés enterrés sous le poids de la réalité. Gracias hombres. Os agradezco mucho por lo que habeis hecho.



Je propose en lien le billet le plus complet et le plus pertinent que j'ai pu trouver sur ''la chute de Towns'': c'est en anglais, mais ça vaut le coup: http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-05-09-the-fall-of-towns","Obviously, it's impossible to recommend this game. But we need to look beyond that, and not just at the fact that it was abandoned and that the developers ""ran off with our money."" No. There's a story behind this scandal, a scandal that will, over time, become a textbook case, at least on its surface: that of the indie game that was never completed and whose paying players were cheated and never reimbursed.

But we need to look at the story of Towns. Because Towns was a pillar. Indeed, it was a textbook case, but for much more than what it created on the surface.
Recounting all this in detail would take too long, so I urge everyone reading this review to look into it. Read articles, learn what happened. Towns was a wonderful experience for me, lasting about ten hours, but a powerful one, because of the music, the context, its story as a game and as an adventure experienced by the developers.

Towns is part of the history of independent gaming, just like Braid, Super Meat Boy, Machinarium, and any others that come to mind. But it's part of it for a different reason: Towns may not have been a colossal success, elevating its creators to the status of untouchable gods, but it played a much more important role: that of explorer, that of pioneer. The unfortunate role of the example not to be followed, the ""role of the idiot."" Do I regret having bought this game so expensively? I don't think so. Because Towns will leave me with indelible gaming memories, because I experienced its story as a directly involved player.

I would still like to thank the three members of the SMP team, who, despite everything, did their best and unfortunately found themselves buried under the weight of reality. Thank you, men. We thank you very much for what you have done.

Years ago, this game was fun. Nothing in this game hadn't been done before, but it brought a lot of things together in an enjoyable package, and new content was being brought out that added facets to the idea of managing a town catering to adventurers and trying to survive the dangers of a D&D world. Now, the game is exactly the same. That's the problem; the end of Towns' beta came purely because the dev wanted more sales for less work.

It's really too bad that the development of this game became something of a hot potato due to fewer sales than the original developer wanted. Towns was developing in an interesting direction, and at the end of the updates had started introducing some enjoyably complicated ways to use basic water channels to make tasks easier. However, it never got to a fully mature stage, instead slowly petering out with updates being smaller and much less often. Eventually, after everyone assumed the dev had already walked away, it was pawned off to make a little more money, to someone who promised new updates but never delivered.

A lot of people are saying not to buy this game because it has been abandoned, and at full price I back that up. But I enjoy it still from time to time, knowing full well what kind of game it is. Maybe you will too?

My recommendation to buy this game comes with the caveat that you should look more closely at what it is, maybe scan through the wiki, and see if you might enjoy it. You can always try it out for an hour, then refund it, you know? But for god's sake don't pay $15 dollars for this, $5 at most.

Eventually, after everyone assumed the dev had already walked away, it was pawned off to make a little more money, to someone who promised new updates but never delivered.

A lot of people are saying not to buy this game because it has been abandoned, and at full price I back that up. But I enjoy it still from time to time, knowing full well what kind of game it is. Maybe you will too?

My recommendation to buy this game comes with the caveat that you should look more closely at what it is, maybe scan through the wiki, and see if you might enjoy it. You can always try it out for an hour, then refund it, you know? But for god's sake don't pay $15 dollars for this, $5 at most. Something to stick on the wishlist and pick up during a steam sale."

Unfortunatly I can't recomend this game. I bought it when it was still young and worthwhile, full of proimise and hope, sadly it has been abandoned.
Don't get me wrong here, I love the concept, I love the style and I love how the game works, but its unfinished, buggy and in need of some serious love. Perhaps the developers would be willing to part with it and hand it to someone who would be better suited to... finishing it off with all the features that I recall seeing on a roadmap... somewhere a long time ago....
If theres anything I can say about the game its that its gotten buggier since I stopped playing it, perhaps thats just the age of my computer finally showing, but I don't think so.
Its still quite challanging in and of itself, but like most of my towns end up, it is very unfinished, ""Hero"" mode and one other mode not implimented, and a lot of things requiring some much needed... laquer.

If you are looking for a game that will play similarly to this one but has a more finished feel try Gnomoria or Banished. Hell even the currently WIP Hearthstone has a more finished and complete feel!

Keep an open mind that games are always subject to change, and that, if this game is lucky, it will be worked on again.","The Short of it:

It's unfinished, unpolished, buggy and will probably never, ever see what it was to become. It has good features and has a lot to it despite being in its forever unfinished state.

Not having even just one person assigned to just one tiny task could end up causing your settlement to crash without enemies even attacking, simply because someone wouldn't go and make flour so you can bake bread so your dedicated farmers could eat and go harvest more wheat to repeat the cycle. 

It's a challenge, but if you're looking for a basic time waster, this game is good for that. I can't recommend it, however, just because of the state it's been left in without further development. If it's on sale for cheap and you like a nice, casual city builder, you might look into it. But for full price, look elsewhere. This game is going nowhere and will forever be that way.","So...where to begin. This game I remember seeing back in 2011 on YouTube and I thought it was pretty cool. Found it on Steam when I joined, bought it when it was on sale for like $5. At the time, it was still being worked on, albeit slowly, so I thought ""why the heck not."" 

Looking back now, this game had potential but was left to rot by the devs and since late 2014 has never received a lick of development. It's unfinished, unpolished, buggy and will probably never, ever see what it was to become. It has good features and has a lot to it despite being in its forever unfinished state.

I originally bought the game at version 8 (now it's version 14e), so yeah, I'm amongst those who were ""cheated"" by early promises, and I will still give this game a thump up.

Why it does deserve the hate? Because it's clearly unfinished.
-Several in-game features are clunky, for example ordering your troops around: you can't simply say ""go there"", you can only place patrol points. So exploring the dungeons beneath the surface is like: right-click somewhere, place waypoint, wait until they get there, right-click on waypoint, remove waypoint, right-click somewhere else, place waypoint, wait until they get there, etc. Since there's no other option I can live with it, but I'm not lovin' it.
-Poor pathfinding. The townies may just ignore the roads, although they walk parallel with them only one square away.
-AI is lacking. The haulers tend to choose stuff to pick up far, far away, instead of that exact same thing they are standing on. And, please, don't go to sleep or eat when several dozens of spiders are besieging the town. Also, don't try to gather loot in the middle of the battlefield, because it's dangerous to your health.
-The variety of stuff to build is a bit underwhelming, although not always. For example you can build one type of wooden chair (not counting that one which needs gold besides wood), but at the same time there are like twenty stone wall styles. So building homes is not on Sims level.
I think these are the negatives worth mentioning, may update if I encounter something I haven't written here yet. Umm, okay, others may say the music is repetitive, but I don't mind, it's not horrible.

Why it does not deserve this much hate:
- Contrary to a lot of other reviews, I have not encountered _any_ bugs, at least not apparent ones. No memory leaks. No hangups, no slowdowns, no CTDs. I don't really get what others mean when they describe this game as ""buggy as ****"". There were a lot of them in earlier versions, but right now this is one of the most bug-free games I ever played.

I will not make a list about other pros, because they are subjective. I just leave here this: I still prefer Towns way over Gnomoria, and if it was a terrible game I wouldn't have come close to play it for 270 hours. Not many of my games can boast that much playtime.



Thus, I dare to say, if you like building towns from blocks, and if Towns is on sale, try it.","Alright folks, the game doesn't deserve all the hate.

Es gibt Helden welche ihr bei Laune halten müsst! Diese erkunden eigenständig ""euer"" Dungeon und leveln auf. Eure Wachen können sich währenddessen um lästige Invasoren kümmern und eure Dörfler sammeln unterdessen Loot ein!
Es ist ein komplexes Spiel, mit vielen Möglichkeiten und es macht halt wie gesagt Spaß (es gibt auch eine Demo....nur so nebenbei). 50% der negativen Reviews regen sich eh nur darüber auf, dass die Entwicklung abgebrochen wurde...am Schluss wurde extra Modding-Support eingefügt damit es nicht stirbt.","Sure, it's been abandoned several times (I think this is the third time), but it's still fun and special in its own way.

The game gets increasingly difficult; invasions come, or zombies infect your inhabitants, and you have a mini-apocalypse. Goblins and orcs appear from time to time and plunder your city. You can trade, etc.
There are heroes you have to keep happy! They explore ""your"" dungeon independently and level up. Your guards can take care of annoying invaders, while your villagers collect loot!
It's a complex game, with many possibilities, and, as I said, it's fun (there's also a demo...just by the way). 50% of the negative reviews are just complaining about the fact that development was canceled...in the end, extra modding support was added so it wouldn't die."

สุดท้ายนี้(ขี้เกียจพิมพ์ละ)จงทำจิตปล่อยวาง Ai ไม่ฉลาดมันคิดไม่ใด้ หมั่นกดหยุดเกมส์เพื่อตรวจสอบเกมส์หรือพักสมอง ...........................อย่าลืมอันนี้สำคัญ หมั่นเชฟบ่อยๆมันจะช่วยคุณใด้เยอะ","It's a small, light game with light specs, but not mind-boggling (it gives me a headache). The graphics are acceptable, except you can't rotate the screen. The AI ​​is quite flexible and hardcore. If you encounter a monster, you'll almost certainly die. The game is a no-brainer, regardless of status. It's like fighting barehanded, and anything close to it will kill you.
The gameplay is simple, but there's a lot to it. Let me explain briefly. Choose a map you like. If you don't like it, just quit without saving. If you think you're up to it, save first. Choose a map slowly and load it. It won't take long. During the first two days, your people won't be hungry, so plant apple trees and rice plants first. Then, plant pine trees. The crop menu is the blue button to the right of the rice plant. You should save because planting pine trees will kill your people outside if you go out to look for saplings (small bushes). Pause the game and check if there are any saplings near monsters. If there are, right-click to destroy them so your people don't have to harvest them.
....I recommend building a market zone (no requirements). There will be merchants selling goods (whistling sound). They might also sell metal (no need to buy much, just use it to make tools). Also, build a tavern room and a tavern zone (not sure if an arena is required). A random hero will be assigned (loud guitar sound). It's definitely better than dividing up your troops (craft weapons and armor for them, but they usually gather it from monsters themselves). The advantage of a hero is that they will roam around and hunt down monsters themselves. With 3-4 of them, it's easy. They have plenty of health and heal very quickly. The disadvantage is that you can't control them. Sometimes, they might get attacked by monsters and run away to ask for help (inviting enemies into your home). Creating a bed, even if it's outside the bedroom zone (I crafted it to sell and then deleted the bedroom zone), is still considered a bedroom.

To craft weapons and armor, press the red menu button to craft (you should place a stockpile in it). Weapons and armor (or else, people won't make them). Start with wooden armor. Stone armor. I recommend skipping steel armor, as leather and wool armor are better. However, if you raise animals (building animal pens, the animals you actually harvest are the ones that roam around the pens; the pens are just for breeding houses), and animals die and bones are everywhere, crafting bone armor is more powerful than stone armor and is very similar to steel armor. (Bone armor is less effective than leather armor, but if you can't craft leather armor yet, use that for now.) But if you have a hero, you're good to go. Spiderstone is abundant. Craft a spider sword (1 copper, 2 spiderstones) or a green spear.

Building a house requires patience. Be careful of people getting stuck on the roof. When placing the roof, place it on the wall first, dragging one row at a time. Don't press ""Cover,"" or it will fall (it's hard to erase). If you're unsure, save it. If you make a mistake, just quit and reload.

Finally (I'm too lazy to type) let your mind go. AI is not smart, it can't think. Press pause often to check the game or rest your brain. ...........................Don't forget this is important. Save often, it will help you a lot."

Finished and relatively bug free.
Ability to give units tasks (and thereby automate your ""Town"")
Dungeon crawling in addition to town/city building
Lots of crafting / building
Resource management

Con:
Devs abandoned the game
14.99 price tag is a bit steep (get it on sale)
Can be rough for beginners / learning curve


Because the game has been abandoned doesn't mean the game is horrible just no additional patches, content, etc for this game.

Personally, I enjoy this game.  It took a bit to figure out but there's a wiki because what game doesn't have a wiki these days ( http://towns.gamepedia.com/Towns_Wiki ).  You can get most/all the information you need to be able to play the game here as well as access to mods or where to get mods.

I like how you're able to relocate/make resource areas to where you want them.  In a lot of these games, generally they just regrow in an area that you've already harvested or you have to craft a special/specific building to harvest any additional resources.  In this game, you can take saplings/seeds/fruit/etc and create an area where you'd like them to grow.  Flowers, trees, etc will still grow in other areas but this allows you to have say 5x5 of trees (for lumber) that will continually regrow in that exact same plot (after being chopped down, a sapling will begin to grow in it's place and after a few minutes you'll have a fully grown tree... this applies to wheat, fruit, etc.).  This makes your villagers much more efficient at gathering and better for your resource management.  It is also significantly safer than traversing the area filled with random monsters like brownies, goblins, ghosts, etc.

The big downside of the game is that a lot of people feel it isn't ""finished"" or ""unpolished"" and the lack of further development.  However, the game is fully functional and the balance may be a little off but that's easily adjustable via the xml files or mods.  Also, game can be pretty brutal at times such as when you expand a bit too early or get raided by monsters and your villagers have no armor nor weapons at their disposal in addition to their piddly health pool.

If you like these kinds of games (city building/resource management) and don't mind that there won't be able more updates then buy the game but I'd recommend waiting until it's on sale.  Even if development has stopped, there's a lot of mods for the game which add content or change texture packs, etc.","Pro:

Unfortunately, right from the start of this games release, you could tell it was not where it should be, despite peoples support and the developers initial passion. All of that interest trailed off into nothingness very quickly, and now all of the initial supporters are left with a scar in their libraries.

やってみれば面白いです。一時は夢中になりました。
荒削りなドット絵のおじさん達がワキャワキャ働いている姿は
微塵もかわいくないのについ目を奪われます。
建材ブロックもそれなりにおしゃれだし、家具も多いです。
シージ(襲撃)や洞窟探索、雪地形や砂漠地形など楽しめる要素が
詰まってるので、決して手抜きのゲームではないです。
採掘のシステムなどもバランスは割といいと思います。

AIがいかんせん馬鹿なので、勝手に遠くまで採集に行って骨に
なってたり、食事抜きでその骨を回収しに行って骨になってたり
なかなか困らせてくれます。
あと洞窟内をわざわざ遠回りして行って骨になったりします。

建築は高さ制限があり、3階建てがやっとできるぐらいです。
(地下から建てればまた別ですが)
それがやっぱり惜しいです。高層建築はロマンですから。
それでも100時間は遊べました。wikiもあります。
前途なきゲームですが、セールなら買ってもいいと思います。","This is a game where you enjoy giving orders to residents and watching them.
It's fun once you try it, and I was hooked for a while.
The rough-hewn pixel art of old men working enthusiastically is not the least bit cute, but it's still captivating.
The building blocks are reasonably stylish, and there's a lot of furniture.
It's packed with fun elements like siege (raids), cave exploration, snowy terrain, and desert terrain, so it's by no means a sloppy game.
I also think the mining system is pretty well-balanced.

The AI ​​is pretty stupid, so it can be quite annoying, like traveling far away to gather forage and turning into bones, or skipping meals to collect those bones and turning into bones again.
It can also be quite annoying, like taking a detour through a cave and turning into bones.

There's a height limit for buildings, and you can only build three stories.
(It's a different story if you build from underground.)
That's a shame, after all. High-rise buildings are the dream.
But even so, I still managed to play for 100 hours. There's also a wiki.

In Towns, you are in charge of an idiotic band of Townies who you instruct to gather resources, build buidlings, craft luxuries, cook food, and defend the town both as soldiers and civilains. In addition to keeping you populace well-fed and happy, you must defend against raiding bands of villians while delving deep into the dangerous underground to find more stone, iron, and gold. You can entice heroes to come and help you or instead swarm the monsters with well-armed townsfolk.

Just don't buy it.  There is no accountability in early access and Steam does nothing to police bad games/developers so you end up with a lot of shovelware like this.  Avoid early access."

Do not buy Towns.  It has ripped off too many people.

Towns is a game about building a village for simulated RPG adventurers. Reading about all the features it had and all the downloads, I figured I would throw in my $5 and play. This is 2013 by the way. Unfortunately, the game was unplayable. With a glitchy interface and the inability to even pass the tutorial or even build one room.

A few months passed from August 2013 and Steam decides to release Green Light, I service indicating which games are incomplete but still up for purchase. To my surprise, Towns was lumped into the newly founded category. Basically, I bought a game I did not know was incomplete. The optimistic side of me thought that Towns would be complete some time in the future.

Fast forward a year to 2014 and I see news that Towns developers gave up on ever finishing the game. Meaning they simply took off with my money.

http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/217154/Alphafunded_Steam_game_Towns_abandoned_by_devs.php

Upon hearing the news, I was again disappointed. 

The following year, Steam released a refund policy. I was excited to read that they would allow refunds that were within 14 days with less than one hour of play time. Given that I have clocked a whopping, miserable 19 minutes on Towns, I figured I could do one last attempt.... DENIED.

So here I am, writing about how much I have been ripped off from buying the game Towns. It was $5 sure, but I didn't know it was incomplete at the time and Steam fails to acknowledge their mistake.

I hope this is the right forum to post to because quite frankly, I feel people should know the darker side that is Steam.

Moral of the story.

Overall Summary
This game is having tough times. Sure the devs have took the money and, almost entirly stopped development (They release fixes, and such). But this is because at this point I can say this game is done! It has many features to explore with alot of replayability in it, the Alpha may aswell be finished. I can say if the community would lighten up and, maybe release a few mods this game would be even better!

Though I admit you can say ""They took the money and, ran!"" you cant blame them after what they have given to us. It is a finished game that I beleive is worth 15$. If you dont beleive me, please try the demo and, see whether it is your cup of tea. 

Gameplay review
The game is highly replayable with diffrent challanges rising, and some just repeating. Your successes may be minor at first but they get bigger and, bigger, and even bigger as you continue through the game! Once you mastered one floor, suprise there is another full of harder, and newer enemies. You can send your soldiers down, but do you want to risk a seige assualting your town when it is ungaurded? ""Oh no! Robert Died!"", these all arise in your game, and I assure you it is a intresting game when on hard difficulty.

The truth is, Steam should do something to force the developers to comply.

Scammers, sewer rats, con artists, twin brothers of corrupt politicians (I don't know if there are any other types), freeloaders, shameless people, storytellers. The developer used the Dwarf Fortress hype to deceive everyone. He's surely working on another similar project, either that or his natural place of residence: prison.

It made the game look too much not like its previous version and dident add anything to the gameplay other then you could build a better looking buildings. The game is a town building game not a building building game they went in the wrong direction however this was not what killed it. What killed it was one of the dev's having a personal crisis that then forced them to not concentrate on the game. This in turn spiraled into more work for the other dev's and them loosing intrest. I would have highly recommended this game a few years ago durning its alpha but it seams soon as it hit steam it was pretty much abandoned. Like the other reviewers I no longer can even recommend buying this game. Maybe if it was 3 bucks but definatly not 15 like what its being asked for.

 Faço isso, por conhecer a falta de conteúdo para jogos escritos em minha língua materna. Diversos são os poréns que assolam a criação destes conteúdos para essa língua. Gostaria de levantar essa temática, mas não vou discutí-la aqui.

 Então, vamos ao que interessa. Towns.

 Towns é um jogo magnífico. Mas, talvez, vc não deva comprá-lo. Sua curva de aprendizagem pode ser elevada, e descobrir como jogar o jogo pode ser complicado. Mesmo que vc procure informações aqui na Steam, ou em outras fontes de pesquisa (Youtube).

 Dito isso, se vc adora construir coisas este é um jogo que você provavelmente gostaria de jogar.

 O software é uma divertidíssima ""ferramenta"" que possibilita a criação de vilas - Towns - atráves do uso de blocos. Utilize sua imaginação e crie a vila dos seus sonhos. No geral, todas elas terão um aspécto medieval. Contudo, se vc seguir meu conselho, poderá criar maravilhosas estruturas modernas.

 Em suma, esteja preparado para enfrentar dificuldades e conhecer uma ferramenta que permite colocar em bits idéias produzidas por seu intelecto!

10/10.","Hello! First of all, I'd like to point out one thing: there are currently no reviews for Towns in Portuguese. I believe this is, and will be, the first.

I'm doing this because I'm aware of the lack of content for games written in my native language. There are several issues that plague the creation of such content for that language. I'd like to raise this topic, but I won't discuss it here.

So, let's get to the point: Towns.

Towns is a magnificent game. But perhaps you shouldn't buy it. Its learning curve can be steep, and figuring out how to play the game can be tricky. Even if you look for information here on Steam or other research sources (YouTube).

That said, if you love building things, this is a game you'll probably enjoy playing.

The software is a fun ""tool"" that allows you to create villages—Towns—through the use of blocks. Use your imagination and create the village of your dreams. In general, they will all have a medieval feel. However, if you follow my advice, you can create wonderful modern structures.

In short, be prepared to face challenges and learn about a tool that allows you to put ideas produced by your intellect into pieces!

10/10."

la pregunta es            ¿lo recomiendo?   en mi experiencia personal, si, pues no estas pagando 50 centimos o dolares la hora (por lo menos yo) 


PD:

yo recomiendo este juego, no recomiendo a sus desarroyadores, pues ellos lo hicieron mal , no el juego, si quieres un juego de gestión y estrategia este puede ser tu juego, pero desde más de 40 horas vas a necesitar mods para nuevo contenido, recuerda, yo recomiendo el juego, que en mi experiencia personal ha sido bueno, no a sus creadores, los cuales lo han abandonado, no creo que se merezca salir de steam pues como dije: no es culpa de el juego que sus desarroyadores los abandonen.

PDD:

yo nada más juzgo al juego, que luego me flamean más que los jugadores del league of legends","It's a good game with a lot of potential. It could end up being a dwarf fortress with an understandable interface and in Spanish, except for its developers, who are lazy, don't update the game, don't create a workshop, and generally don't add playable content, which is a shame. But if you find mods, you can spend hundreds of hours on it. If you use the default mod, like I do, I doubt it. In my case, it was 73.2 hours. I'm eager to try it again. Although there aren't many random elements yet, so it's not too difficult as long as you know what to do at the beginning, it can become easy. Later, the random part of this game will affect you more, and that's why you can always not know how to react and lose your village.

The question is, do I recommend it? In my personal experience, yes, because you're not paying 50 cents or dollars an hour (at least I am).

P.S.:

I recommend this game. I don't recommend its developers, because they did it wrong, not the game. If you want a management and strategy game, this could be your game, but after more than 40 hours, you'll need mods for new content. Remember, I recommend the game, which in my personal experience has been good, not its creators, who abandoned it. I don't think it deserves to leave Steam because, as I said, it's not the game's fault that its developers abandoned them.

P.S.:

I only judge the game; they'll then criticize me more than League of Legends players."

>>> Проверено! Разработка игры заброшена

Towns - настоящий монумент, посвященный несовершенству STEAM Greenlight и Early Access, их концепции ""сначала деньги - потом функционал"". В чем суть? Игру продавали, обещания давали. Потом взяли и свалили, забив на доработки. Игра до сих пор продается за 300 рублей. 

Оскорбляет ли вас как покупателей такая ситуация - решайте сами.

Но стоп. Пару слов о игре: номинально мы имеем изометрический фентезийный градостроительный ""sandbox"" выживастик с непрямым управлением NPС и РПГ элементами. В начале генерится карта c ресурсами и живностью (в т.ч. агрессивной), собираете полезные ресурсы избегая монстров, строите склады, организуете поставку еды своему поселению, строите здания и инструменты (функциональность комнат определяете вы), вооружаете людей и зазываете героев... ну и дальнейшее обустройство, шахты, монстры и т.д... концепт в общем интригующий. Однако, как уже было сказано игрушка заброшена. Т.е. то что есть, оно как бы и играбельно, но при этом в какой-то момент контент, заложенный в игру кончается и... и все.

Итог? Гениальный, но не реализованный концепт. То, что продается здесь - скорее расширенное DEMO. Но я *давно* деньги платил не за демо, а за полноценную игру. В итоге считаю себя обманутым... проводя аналогию с едой... это как будто вместо обещанного холодильника набитым мясом получаешь маленький бутерброд. :*(",">>> Verified! Wasted money
>>> Verified! Game development abandoned

Towns is a veritable monument to the imperfections of STEAM Greenlight and Early Access, their ""money first, functionality later"" philosophy. What's the point? They sold the game, made promises, then abandoned it, neglecting to improve it. The game is still selling for 300 rubles.

Whether this situation offends you as a customer is up to you to decide.

But wait. A few words about the game: It's essentially an isometric fantasy city-building ""sandbox"" survival game with indirect NPC control and RPG elements. At the beginning, a map with resources and creatures (including aggressive ones) is generated. You collect useful resources while avoiding monsters, build warehouses, organize food supplies for your settlement, construct buildings and tools (you determine the functionality of the rooms), arm your people and recruit heroes... and then there's further development, mines, monsters, etc. The concept is generally intriguing. However, as already mentioned, the game is abandoned. That is, what exists is playable, but at some point the content built into the game runs out and... that's it.

The bottom line? A brilliant, but unfulfilled concept. What's being sold here is more of an extended DEMO. But I paid money *long ago* not for a demo, but for the full game. Ultimately, I feel cheated... to use the food analogy... it's like getting a small sandwich instead of a promised fridge full of meat. :*("

I've also experianced the errors previous reviewers have talked about so if you are worried about those I don't recommend you buy this game, though I did honestly enjoy my time (as I go onto explain).

(P.s. sorry for all the brackets I didn't really know how to start this review, but lets jump in)

MY EXPERIANCE:

At first I really hated this game, I didn't know how the layers worked or what I was doing and had to restart countless times. At one point I thought I'd quit, though because my brother had bought it and it was one of my first steam games I decided I would give one last good try.

Starting in a winter world (which is completely dominated by monsterous and powerful yeti's) my town of 20 was beaten back to just two to one-three guys (I can't remember how many probably two). Luckily they'd picked some fruits off some trees and I managed to retreat into the caves and block myself off from the Yeti outside world. Slowly I managed to turn my few fruit trees into a little cavern of food and my people were able to survive. After a while the caves became constricting and I needed to expand outside. I knew (by google) that more towns folk would only arrive if my people were happy (which they now were) and if they could actually get to my town from the corner of the map - stuck in a cave I guess this was a problem.
I managed to get my townies to avoid the Yeti's on the south-west side of the cave and I built a outdoor fenced area where I could now grow trees who needed to be on different soil and I had a gate to let new townies in.
Eventually I was able to expand my huge cave fortress across all the mountains, I had dug underground to collect armour and armour building equipment from the enemies below and I faced the yeti's in an epic battle of survival in which I won.

Skip ahead a few hours and my townies owned the map, had built a lake with a giant castle in honour of the war and a grave yard in which many brave soldiers perrished. Including my favourite townies who all had names (yes I learnt some of the names.) I continued down about 10 levels of dungeon and this is about when I started to stop playing. I guess I had quite a few goals and enemies in my game experiance and so I thoroughly enjoyed it.

THERE ARE A FEW CONS:

I'm not sure if after playing this game for so long with very little else to do I began to enjoy it, or if it was a combination of the difficulty of my original situation in the winter world and own imagination of each of my townies lives that got me to love this game. Either way I do love this game though I also understand the negative comments.

Just to clarify, I've had people die on building walls and I don't know how they got there. You have to be careful in what way things are prioritised. The AI are quite slow at building and that does rack up the hours, but you can leave it running for a while once you've got started with a bunch of tasks for them all to do. Baking is esential and so are fruits and stores and this really threw me off because people would just starve themselves out for no good reason. Sometimes when my townies had died I'd had to go back to a previous save just to figure out how and try to save them before they died again.

SUMMARY/tl;dr:

I by no means can tell you that this game is finsihed or of perfect quality, and if you're really worried about the £10 (it was cheaper when I bought it) then I wouldn't recommend it. Though what I can say, and have done a few times now, is that I really, really loved this game once I got into it. I guess the little micro managing and working out how it functions in the end made me feel a bit tallented at the game. :P","Tbh I don't know if I should recommend this game or not...I clicked recomend because I enjoyed it (and I think my review is pretty honest so I don't want to have it masked/taken down as others seem to have been), but the thing is I cannot tell you why I liked it so much (though after 244 hours of game play I felt that I should at least try to review it).

The reason they gave up and left the game is because they released the game too soon and incomplete, too many complaints piling up, been recieving too many abused messangers about where the money gone, why the problems isn't resolved quick.
It an old saying 'people make mastakes' 'nothing is perfect' as far as i'm aware they did tried their best to get back into track and sort Towns out as soon as possible without anymore stress.

I know ALL the players who bought Towns (which is more then 200,000 in the research) are very demanding to get the game working again and fill in the gaps which are incomplete, i understand we players want a full working game but hey why not play other games while waiting for them to fix it rather ranting at them to push them around to get it done asap.

I hope they do get back in track and recreate Towns from scratch, since it mainly possible to try fix the first Towns to get it back up and complete or start from scratch for better version and replace the old Towns which would be easy but if it still left the Early Game Access.

i want to click as maybe instead of grenn yes button or red no button, but i would give it a thumbs up to give them hope to get Towns going.

It an old saying 'people make mastakes' 'nothing is perfect' as far as i'm aware they did tried their best to get back into track and sort Towns out as soon as possible without anymore stress.

I know ALL the players who bought Towns (which is more then 200,000 in the research) are very demanding to get the game working again and fill in the gaps which are incomplete, i understand we players want a full working game but hey why not play other games while waiting for them to fix it rather ranting at them to push them around to get it done asap.

I hope they do get back in track and recreate Towns from scratch, since it mainly possible to try fix the first Towns to get it back up and complete or start from scratch for better version and replace the old Towns which would be easy but if it still left the Early Game Access.

i want to click as maybe instead of grenn yes button or red no button, but i would give it a thumbs up to give them hope to get Towns going.

Happy Gaming players :)"

Now for the review:

The game is time consuming which is why you may see players with a fair amount of hours, the bugs become more apparent the longer you play. Horrible AI, AI starving itself with plenty of food. Slow productivity of the AI. You have to micromanage every aspect of the game which to me and everyone else in the forums, is horrible AI construction and pathing that they will not fix. If you attempt to build a house all at once in the game, the builders constructing it will not stop working on it until it is finished, that includes dieing in the process from starvation (with plenty of food next to them).... feel free to drop me a comment on here with anything else you would like to know. *I do not respond to Lvl 0 Steam accounts with blocked profiles, your comment will get deleted. 

Dungeons get even more involved and getting to them is a pain... to say the least. Construction is not polished at all. 

To sum it up, the game runs, if you work around the poor mechanics of the game, it is playable. Its extremely time consuming which looking at this game, it should be a faster payout of fun since its a bit behind its time. 

There is no Dev support in the forums, just moderators pushing the game every now and then.

Reinstalled and played the game again a few months ago.....and found that nothing had changed in almost 2 years!

The developer insisted that the product is playable upon time of release, after Early Access was terminated. While the game was playable, the words were decieiving. A playable game should not be released if there are still countless bugs to be fixed and several key features that have not been added to the game.

It's such a shame, because the game had great potential and an idea for a somewhat unique mechanic. But I can't recommend this game to anyone, unless you are looking for examples of how a good concept can go bad, learn the idea, and take time to figure out how to improve upon it with your own game.

A reminder, these kind of boycott threads will NOT be tolerated. There's a reviews page for reviews; if people ask for opinions then that's another place to give them; but these unsolicited boycott threads are just unacceptable.

I highly disagree with this. My original post was notifying potential buyers of a great review that was written about this game. It told the back story of what happened with the devs for this game and how they abandoned it(surprise? it just happened again). How could that be a ""boycott thread""? If I had somehow managed to find a positive review for towns and asked the user base to read it and get educated of the background of the game it would somehow be tolerated. This just again shows how shady you are YetiCHow for removing threads entirely and labelling them as something they are not.

Update:  YetiChow has now updated his original post to again try to make me look bad.  If you are going to police the forums in a dictatorship manner and not allow users to share reviews or their opinions unless it is in a positive way atleast own up to it.

Rather than casting you as the hero who goes into the dungeons in search of fame and glory, you are in charge of building and organizing the town above the dungeon where the hero rents his hotel room and buys his weapons.  That said, this game really isn't as much fun as it sounds.  It is an extensive exercise in MICRO-MANAGEMENT.  If you can get it for REALLY REALLY CHEAP, then it's worth playing if you enjoy games like the original Warcraft (the original, not WoW!!) or Sim City.  I have to say though, I am not a fan of any game where the townsfolk will starve to death if you just leave them alone for a while.

You start out with a handful of citizens and absolutely no town.  Your first 4 hours of play will be dedicated to gathering food and setting up a farm so your citizens don't starve to death (which they will do QUITE OFTEN if you are not paying attention!!).  Your next 6 hours of play will be dedicated to mining a few piles of rock and mud, chopping down a few trees, and building some basic workshops for your citizens to work in.  Then you'll spend another 3 hours setting up a kitchen and a bakery, as well as some animal farms so your people can eat something besides apples.  Only after that will you worry about building a tavern for traveling heroes to stay and eat at.  And only after THAT will you start digging down into the dungeon.  Digging into the dungeon and having a tavern with at least one open tavern bedroom are the requirements for heroes to start coming to your town.  Different types of heroes will come based on how deep into the dungeon you are, how many people live in your town, and what type of furniture you have in the tavern bedroom.  Once you do get into the dungeons, there are a ton of monsters which will probably kill everyone who finds their way down the  tunnel.  But there are more resources in the dungeon that you can't find on the surface, like iron, copper, silver, and gold... and you need a ton of those to build better weapons and armor for your city guards.  Meanwhile, you might randomly have a Werepig go berserk on your town and KILL EVERYONE, or you might have a sudden invasion by monsters from the forest and THEY ALL DIE.  But NEVER FORGET... the number one priority AT ALL TIMES has to be food production or else your entire city will starve because the citizens are as stupid as rocks.

One good thing about this game is that it is VERY EASY to create mods for it.  You can mess with the amount and placement of various resources, enemies, even mountains and plants.  If you want to get deeper into the config files, you can even change the number of citizens you start with, alter citizen and hero attributes, and even alter enemies to make them easier or harder.","The bottom line:  This game has an interesting premise.

Therefore, to achieve your goals (prosperity, dungeon raiding, etc.), you must carefully monitor the cycle of residents, production, and consumption to ensure they remain connected.

I justified both purchases, because I was genuinely excited over the prospect of the game, and wanted to support it as much as I could. I was wrong.

The game and by extension the original community presented the concept to be a Dwarf Fortress like game with better graphics, but I would argue that it is more closely related to the old Majesty games without a mission scenario. Your objective is to build up a town that will attract adventure's. You are tasked to manage and create food for the town, gather materials for building and forging tools/weapons, and eventually mine beneath the surface and break into dungeons beneath the map. All the while you need to defend your townspeople against invaders, native enemy's and eventually the monsters living within the dungeons.

The art is very inconsistent. Between block styles, animals and items within the game, there seems to be a 'mish-mash' of different approaches to how things ought to look, and none of them are particularly good. The animation is non existent. Everything glides across the screen, the combat looks like how a child emulate a 'fight' by smashing two dolls together.  

Gameplay wise, you are allowed to create various structures, however you want. Similar to prison architect and DF-9, the game follows a system where you designate the type of room (bakery or carpenters workshop), and then supply those rooms with the necessary components allow those rooms to function (such as an oven, or bakers table). Buildings can be multiple floors up or down, though rooms are restricted to one level. The AI is what ruins the game for me. Peasants will frequently pick fights with monsters unarmed if they are near them. Like the Majesty, you cannot control the hero's that come to your town, however you also cannot curb or influence the hero's with gold or bounties. You simply have to hope the hero's will go where you need them too on their own. 

The menu's and displays aren't pretty to look at either, and navigating through the various menu's is rather unintuitive.

The sounds are pretty terrible to be honest, especially the sound for when peasants eat food or die. If you happen to have your earphones on, and at a high volume, I would imagine it would cause your ears to bleed. Overall, the sound effects are pretty generic, but maybe I'm expecting too much from an Indie game after playing Minecraft.

Now at the time, I could just explain such issues away, because the game was still in active development. However the game has since been abandoned by it's developers, and no further updates are planned. Because of that, I can't in good faith recommend this game. There's too much simply missing or unpolished for this to be considered a good purchase.","I ended up buying this game twice, once when I first heard about it from various communities speaking favorably of what it could become, and again when the game was eventually greenlit on steam.

Don't get me wrong, the game is very enjoyable, maybe even to a point where I could consider it good, but it is however an unfinished product. A few very minor bugs are present, the AI is a bit dopey, the enemy scaling is absurd (due to the market system, you can get Gold, a top tier material early on and proceed to completely stomp the first 5 or 6 floors of the dungeon, then suddenly it all comes to a halt on the next floor as enemies can one or two shot your heroes regardless of armor because armor only increases evasion, it doesn't make people more capable of taking damage) the game can have massive lag at times when doing mass item hauling (most common when you want to sell several buckets of iron) and the punishment for doing something wrong can be horrible especially when you don't know why said thing is bad (ie you have to make graves for corpses or they spawn strong ghosts, but now there's an event lategame that can rarely spawn even stronger Zombies for your village to fight off if you didn't build your graveyard a mile away, even high level zombies can spawn potentially adding to the death toll unless your village is well equipped O_O 

However, despite all the bad things, I feel like they're more nitpicks that could be ironed out later (if they ever do) the game is strangely satisfying when you do the smallest of things. I felt glad when I got my first town up and running with a constant food supply and with enough production to allow the town to build walls and decor to make them happier, which brings more people in, and eventually Heroes, whom I also got a nice warm feeling from when they moved in, especially a cameo from the fantastic Sips_ :D. When a dungeon level gets cleared there's also that good feeling when you clean all the loot out and equip the village with better items to withstand the ever increasing sieges that want to ruin all your fun. Overall there's just a great feeling I get from getting things done right, it's oddly satisfying to watch all your little people mine out all the stone before converting it into a storage room for your builders so you can continue to build up the town walls to make it harder for the sieges from completely stomping all over all your work so far, and i got a really good chuckle when the nasty hoard of yeti coming in to storm the place is almost completely wiped out before they reach their victims because you built a bridge that serves as the only way in that's completely lined with traps, and watching them set them all off (sadly there's no real animation, but it's still great to watch a big bad yeti get his foot caught in a bear trap and his friend who walked on ahead set off the bamboo shooter, hitting them both as well as anyone else nearby, then the log traps finish off the already wounded, before the villagers team up to pick off any surviving monsters that are likely bleeding from every possible area of their body. Perhaps next time they'll realize that the decaying goblin heads shoved on the pikes outside are a sign that this town is defended) 

If you already own a copy go ahead and have a blast directing all your little people to their fates. Grab some mods to fix some of the problems and some of the frustrating elements and you're good to go. If it appears in a bundle with some other things you're interested in, go ahead and give it a go, you might like it. But I would not buy this game through steam now, especially at full price, when there are more options available that either offer more polished development, are cheaper or promise so much more in the future. Gnomoria, Craft the World and Banished are all around the same price but all offer their own quirks and are still being developed regularly or are even finished in the case of Banished.

The main reason I am not recommending this is because the devteam, they released a game which was basically in alpha, but not stating as such, they slowly developed said game over about a year, then dropped it. Now I can perfectly understand their situation, as one who actually browsed the forums, they got too deep into something they shouldn't have, their reputation was on the line, their own personal lives were causing them trouble. They hired another developer but their paycheck would have been so low that they too eventually dropped the project. When the game was left in this dropped state, the steam community went wild, with people buying the game just to give it a negative review, the product tags mostly consisting of ""scam"" and ""abandoned"" and the reviews said nothing about the game. The development of the game has since continued, however i would still not buy this game until they can promise to the buyers that they can bring out frequent updates (updates as of late have been very minor and slow, but a v15 is in development to help fix some issues)

So until then, if you have it already, have fun, otherwise it's probably best to stay away unless it's on sale for £3 and you're curious or have nothing better to do for a rainy weekend.

It has a lot of complexity, but not very accessible... be prepared for a little front loading on tutorials. The features are a bit haphazardly put together, but you can still cobble together a pretty good experience out of it. 

The tragedy here is that the developer quit working on the game before it was completed. In all honesty, I wish Towns had been where it is now when it was put up for early access. Developers calling it quits or settling for ""almost good enough"" is getting pretty tiring in the independant market.","The Towns Tragedy: A Case Study in Early Access

I was an active contributor on the game forums along with others who shared the same passion.

The game was becoming more and more complex (which isnt necessarily a bad thing) but the way the developer did it made it more robust and annoying to get into. On top of that, each update introduced more and more bugs. The developers became less and less responsive. One of them left due to family concerns which is understandable. The gap between updates became longer and longer. Soon enough, the developers just disappeared. The game stayed in its buggy alpha state for months. Then out of nowhere a new dev was hired to fix it up. Except after only one update, he too seemingly has disappeared and the game continues in its buggy alpha state. I wanted to love this game. I wanted to see this game completed and succeed, I really wanted to. I now see that that future will never arrive.

It's a game where you do not directly control the units, you say what you would like done and the AI gets around to it, sorta like dwarf fortress..... but wait, that only works if the AI is functional. The AI is this game is more brainless than the original AI in Master of Orion 3.

Der Hauptknackpunkt nemlich Terraforming wurde auch behoben . Was will man mehr ich habe dieses Spiel Stunde um Stunde gezockt die Entwicklung verfolgt... Ich kann nur dazu sagen die Grafik ist nicht die welt denoch passent, die KI hat ihre schwierigkeiten man spielt sich aber in die kleinen Fehler leicht ein, die Starken fehler umgeht man später mit Erfahrung ganz einfach , schade ist es das ein Ziel nicht wirklich erkennbar ist. Man Baut größer besser aber eine wirkliches Ziel wie einen Boss der zu besiegen ist gibt es nicht. Das Wachen oder wie ich sie nenne ""Pfosten"" sind mehr zur deku dar sie sind nur zu gebrauchen bei geringen höhen oder wenn man sie per Patrolie durch die Gegend sendet , zu gebrauchen sind sie eigentlich nur für die Siege Wellen die schlicht weg ein Witz ist einfaches Taktisches Baun und die Wellen packen ein. Das wunderschöne Job zuweisungs system ist schlicht weg ein Zeit vertreib der sich nicht lohnt ohne zuweisung arbeiten alle bewohner viel effektiever.Um bewohner in die Stadt bzw gehäufte blocke zu bekommen  reicht einfaches festlegen von räumen ohne Wände und warloses verteilen von Dekuration find ich persönlich gut dar dann mehr möglichkeiten Offen bleiben. Schade ist das es zwar händler gibt aber nicht einen für Monster Essenzen die man bereits gefunden hat was zur späteren erschöpfung der Resorcen sorgt. Doch drotz dieser Mängel bleibt der Spaß nicht unbedingt auf der Strecke. Dieses Spiel eignet sich Prima zum Zeitvertreib aber nicht als voll zeit Spiel. Ich Persönlich finde das dieses spiel auch für Kinder die Geduld aufweisen sehr gut geeignet ist , die wenigen kampf scenen sind nicht brutal bis auf en blutfleck ist nicht viel zu sehn am ende... der kampf selbst handelt sich um Figuren vor zurück Bewegen.","I think Towns is a good game; it was discontinued during development, but we can live with what we have. The main problem, terraforming, has also been fixed. What more could you want? I've played this game for hours, following its development... All I can say is that the graphics aren't great, but they're still adequate. The AI ​​has its difficulties, but it's easy to get used to the small mistakes. The more serious ones are easily avoided later with experience. It's a shame that the goal isn't really identifiable. You build bigger, it's better, but there isn't a real goal like a boss to defeat. The guards, or as I call them ""posts"", are more for decoration; they're only useful at low altitudes or when you send them around on patrol. They're really only useful for siege waves, which is a joke; simple tactical building, and the waves pack up. The wonderful job allocation system is simply a waste of time; without allocation, all the residents work much more effectively. To get residents into the city or into clustered blocks, simply defining rooms without walls and distributing decorations without warning is enough. I personally think it's good as it leaves more options open. It's a shame that although there are traders, there isn't one for monster essences that you've already found, which leads to resources being depleted later. But despite these shortcomings, the fun isn't necessarily spoiled. This game is great for passing the time, but not as a full-time game. I personally think that this game is also very suitable for children who have patience. The few fight scenes aren't brutal; apart from a bloodstain, there isn't much to see at the end... the fight itself involves moving figures forward and backward."

MANY hours, and most of the 'towns' i created ended up bugged or lag-based on all accounts or glitched on load. So many faults, but i found it most likely i was building or mining something that was 'illegal' and had in previous versions faulted the game. New not good enough last ever update fixed some of the errors. My latest game or town i created, makes me rank this game AS WORTH HAVING, since no new updates are ever going to be created, possible it might be modified at some point some where on if... possibly nothing if or possible. The game recent, the only possible idea that could make this game work is more glabol control.
Point 1,
IF! if the game had an 'unlock all objects' key, which would be including those on top such as 2nd story roof and up, and scroll across the map, and a ignore all unlocked items, fading them from view so that you could rebuild as you expand, say 20 townies later on you might want to change the look of your town so that happiness is added more fluently(happiness draws in more townies, tip block all roads with fences and 1 block openings still fenced-in although the spot is used with a high happiness decoration, all townies must take the fensed roads, and always gain happiness, the fences should block line of sight too, for all other lower decorations that make your town unique looking and worth creating and blocking sight of other unhappy such stuff [corpses lol]!) so to wrap up point 1, once you build something expect to keep it, even if u realize you wasted a whole lotta space with little useless alleys that u got to block off anyways or whatever your reason. as well as each building wall block needs to be clicked to unlocked(why no auto unlock key?), It is fun to create brick by brick so to speak until you have clicked thousands and thousands of times, and you only have maybe 20 fully furnished and roofed structures(like 15% of the map if you build BIG), but where is the schematic page, where you can create and paste what you want.. I MEAN COME ON WTF stupid person could not add a schematic setup so that you do not neED to place brick by brick every damn BRICK. You might not understand the awesome happiness system, i do i love it, as is I gain 4 townies every few minutes until i reach about 100(ofcourse the townies live in unwalled unroofed houses with a single high happiness object each, only until later do i now design my town), maybe 2 hours of playing saying that at some point(in the past sometimes my game just would not load, or whateverbug at the time, since update final ive had almost no issues with bugs, sometimes lag after a while and i just have to restart towns game and its fixes) some point i dont lose my game and ok and i cap off my residents because i am tired of making the same structures to fit each part of my town, i make 80% the same with different base or roof designs. END POINT 1.

Point 2.
WTF my townies die for the most stupid reasons, and when one dies the rest follow, it takes 30 seconds for 1 high level enemy to sneak past a new hedge that grants access into your town to murder all of your townies before a single soldier townie arrives. The soldier system is laughable, the level system is worse, the townies ability to form soldier groups looks near identicle and stands on the screen right next to the 'return townies to civi status' and if you do that that once soldier loses all levels and expereienced gain. So two hours in my level 30 warrior reverts to lvl 1 cause i missclicked. Do i reload? wait i just cleared that floor and salvaged some structures (I do not want to reclick the structures brick by brick to move together to add more what/ever is needed floor layout). Its a bummer, the soldiers four options are useful, well 1 is useful the 'patrol script', say you have 3 soldiers and a single patrol point, at least one soldier will be there if that single spot needs defending. So you can bundle your town opening with your dungeon opening and that one soldier can last until heros or townies or your actual soldiers get off thier fat behinds and leave the dining room to fight or patrol is what it is. What could be added, is a auto level for all characters based on time they have been in your town, or gain experience for all townies, but soldiers gain double. As is the soldier usage can be annoying, i try to make 1/8 to 1/4 townies into soldiers since i play on the hardest difficulty and i do survive most instances of invasion.

Point Final

As was townies die, or the game glitches because some townie is trying to fly off a roof, or climb three spaces high for that first piece of stone or ore and cannot reach, that does now with the last update usually cancel all actions for a townie that cannot reach or interact with a ai-script(farming,mining,building) and does not cause too much of an issue. Unless that townie is behind that 3 story wall just too far to reach the ground, and dies of starvation, scaffolding!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WTF WHY is there no auto build SCAFFOLDING when something is just out of reach, or why start up the map with stupid stone bricks i need to mine on the surface of the map stacked up like some tower. REcent update added scaffolds decay after time, so no need to delete them unless that immediate space is needed, wait a while and the scaffolding will fade away from the game, its kind of cool getting a 3 story structure up and watching it unfold as teh scaffolding decays away and reveals the time you spent clicking each brick into place, each window painstackingly placed. It makes it worth it too, if like I do often I show off my towns online or to friends i say hey look what i spent four hours making.( I got one friend to buy the game, and after about ten hours of playing he had about 15 townies, i wanted to cry) The game has no introduction, as well as no explanation, examples being bone torch=1 happiness, harp=2 happiness, decorated wall= go ---- yourself(i think to myself) it does not add any worth while happiness as it does override all better happiness objects. 

EXTRA POINT------------------------------- MAKE ALL WALLS,optional decorated(same look but with makes happiness) and costs say 1 extra material of a single needed of a single variety.
Back TO last POINT of interest------------- Play this game only if you understand ai scripts and basic map editor knowledge as once you get the hang of it, its totally easy to play even on the hardest of difficulties, my favorite too because you do not get stupid molerats stealing your food, instead just some ogres to fight. 

Yes i recommend this game to anyone who has a brain and enjoyings a challenge, it is unfinished, good chance what there is is all there will ever be in this game. 
So far, I have yet to find a single piece of useful information on the forums and online searches, you need to learn from the game, find the flaws and single them out.

Either map type,
FIRST ACTION-------------- CREATE 16 resident tiles 3x3 each, wait 30 seconds, you get more townies to start the game with!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SECOND ACTION----------- Make into soldiers all townies and hunt down all of the monsters on the surface of the map, no not leave a single monster alive. Change all but the best soldier(based on stats, only hp and offense matter) back into 
townies(equip the townies who are your lumber workers with the dropped weapons from the monsters. ENJOY a fruitful start to a great town.

- Les longues parties entrainent une consommation de puissance notable, allant jusqu'à rendre injouables les sous-sols profonds au bout d'une poignée d'heures sur un netbook
- La musique est agréable au premier abord, puis [b]assez vite[/b] répétitive
- Les chemins empruntés par les Townies ne sont pas toujours pertinents (Mais pourquoi il a été chercher l'aggro ? Pourquoi ??), et parfois fatals pour des raisons stupides (ils vont chercher à terminer leur action en cours coûte que coûte indépendamment de leurs besoins vitaux, quitte à mourrir de faim avant d'arriver à l'objectif...)
- Il n'est pas encore possible (en version 1_14e) de gérer les coffres par ""groupes"", rendant la localisation des ressources au mieux fastidieuse, au pire complètement aléatoire
- Les invasions aléatoires (heureusement désactivables) sont une plaie en début de jeu (même en niveau facile) en l'absence de héros pour défendre le village, puis deviennent d'une simplicité déconcertante quand ils arrivent
- Le jeu est limité dans le nombre d'ennemis qui ont le droit de se déplacer, une accumulation d'invasions (ils sont une une nuée en difficulté très élevée !) fournit un résultat assez indésirablement drôle à observer, puisque les monstres se font découper sans broncher, le temps que leurs trop nombreux copains bougent sur le reste de la carte
- La vue est énorme, il aurait été souhaitable de pouvoir ""dézoomer"" pour avoir un meilleur aperçu d'ensemble du terrain
- Les objets ayant une image qui s'affiche sur plusieurs cases de haut ""traversent"" visuellement les couches supérieures, rendant fouillies les constructions d'étages au-dessus des arbres par exemple

Les bons côtés :
- Jeu très addictif quand il est maîtrisé
- Les chaînes de production sont intéressantes
- Le mode de gestion des ressources semi-automatique est très appréciable
- L'exploration du monde est gratifiante (les sous-sols regorgent de monstres sanguinaires et de ressources uniques !)
- Le monde (malgré une surface assez faible) contient un nombre de couches suffisamment important pour y entasser tous les Townies de vos rêves
- De nombreuses bonnes idées sont mises en oeuvre (marchands qui viennent apporter des ressources pour compléter un risque de pénurie, héros à nourrir sinon ils quittent tout simplement le village, bonheur moyen des villageois à assurer pour en attirer d'autres)
- La communauté fournit des mods très imposants (notamment l'indispensable Towns++ (ayant fait l'objet d'une traduction Fr/multilingue il y a quelques versions, non tenue à jour)), et dont les bonnes idées sont intégrées nativement au jeu

Il est à regretter que le développement soit arrêté : les problèmes de consommation de mémoire ne seront donc pas résolus avant une refonte du coeur, qui n'aura vraisemblablement jamais lieu.
Les autres mauvais côtés peuvent néanmoins être corrigés dans les prochains patchs (groupes de coffres, arrêt d'action d'un Townie en cas de besoin vital), voire de nouvelles surprises arriver (traduction native multilingue), et les bons côtés sont déjà solides.
Pour 12€, il y en a pour plusieurs heures de découverte et de GamePlay valables pour joueurs occasionnels et amateurs du genre, mais dont la maîtrise totale ne doit pas être vue comme un challenge pour les joueurs invétérés.


Je recommande globalement ce jeu.","Towns is the abandoned game with the most updates to my knowledge, far more than other ""in development"" games that are ultimately abandoned!

What can I say about the game? It's playable, has some very good and some very bad points. The downsides:
- Long games consume a significant amount of power, even making deep basements unplayable after a few hours on a netbook.
- The music is pleasant at first, then [b]quickly[/b] becomes repetitive.
- The paths taken by the Townies aren't always relevant (But why did he go looking for aggro? Why?), and sometimes fatal for stupid reasons (they'll try to complete their current action at all costs regardless of their vital needs, even if it means starving to death before reaching the objective...).
- It's not yet possible (in version 1_14e) to manage chests by ""groups,"" making locating resources tedious at best, and completely random at worst.
- Random invasions (fortunately, they can be disabled) are a pain at the beginning of the game (even on easy difficulty) in the absence of heroes to defend the village, then become disconcertingly simple when they arrive
- The game is limited in the number of enemies allowed to move, and a buildup of invasions (they're a swarm on very high difficulty!) creates a rather undesirably funny effect, as monsters are cut down without flinching, while their numerous friends move across the rest of the map.
- The view is enormous; it would have been nice to be able to ""zoom out"" to get a better overview of the terrain.
- Objects with an image that is displayed several squares high visually ""cross"" the upper layers, making building floors above trees seem cluttered, for example.

The good points:
- Very addictive game when mastered.
- The production chains are interesting.
- The semi-automatic resource management mode is very enjoyable.
- Exploring the world is rewarding (the basements are full of bloodthirsty monsters and unique resources!)
- The world (despite its relatively small surface area) contains a A large enough number of layers to cram all the Townies of your dreams in.
- Many good ideas are implemented (merchants who bring resources to compensate for a risk of shortages, heroes who must be fed or they simply leave the village, average villager happiness to be ensured to attract others).
- The community provides very impressive mods (notably the essential Towns++ (which underwent a French/multilingual translation a few versions ago, not updated)), and whose good ideas are natively integrated into the game.

It's unfortunate that development has stopped: memory consumption issues will therefore not be resolved before a core overhaul, which will likely never happen.
The other downsides may, however, be fixed in future patches (chest groups, stopping a Townie's action in case of vital need), or even new surprises may arrive (native multilingual translation), and the upsides are already solid.
For €12, there are several hours of discovery and gameplay, suitable for casual players and fans of the genre, but mastering it completely shouldn't be a challenge for hardcore gamers.

I generally recommend this game."

11938752,spanish,2014.07.31 23:19,❌,❌,0.5,0,"Towns es un juego en etapa beta, de administrar pueblos fantásticos, con sus respectivas catacumbas, héroes y criaturas fabulosas, la fórmula opuesta a Dungeon Keeper, y fuertemente inspirado en Dwarf Fortress. Como en el caso de Gnomoria, Goblin Camp, Dwarves! o A Game of Dwarves, intenta implementar aspectos faltantes en su modelo a seguir, así como le resta capas de complejidad y esoterismo al juego de culto de los hermanos Adams, resultando en un producto accesible y entretenido durante unas cuantas horas.

Para ser un proyecto muy independiente y siguiendo los pasos de un juego tan restrictivo y obscuro como lo es Dwarf Fortress, Towns es un proyecto decente. Sin embargo, no está exento de problemas.

El tutorial para aprender a controlar a los Townies, una inclusión bienvenida (y necesaria) en este tipo de simuladores, está narrado por una especie de asesor. Los problemas empiezan cuando se advierte que la lengua nativa de los desarrolladores es el español, y los textos en inglés son pobres y a menudo confusos. A alturas de la versión V14, la más reciente hasta la fecha, el tutorial no reconoce algunos comandos e instrucciones, y en mi caso particular no tengo audio en lo absoluto (el audio en sí no es muy bueno ni atractivo, hasta donde lo recuerdo de la V9)

Lon gráficos isométricos con sprites bidimensionales no son agradables a la vista, reminiscentes al vilipendiado Farmville de Zynga. Los Townies carecen de carisma, y en ocasiones los items y el equipamiento se cuelgan de forma poco elegante. Intentando crear una interfaz limpia y accesible para el mouse, Towns peca de no ofrecer suficientes hotkeys en el teclado, y algunos de los menús de construcción se pueden perder si uno no hace click en en lugar correspondiente, obligando a recorrer toda la serie de menús nuevamente.

En cuanto a ciertos elementos de la mecánica de juego, como la decoración, son innecesariamente complicados (incluso más que en Dwarf Fortress) y limitan el estilo de juego que uno quiera adoptar.

Las actualizaciones a este tipo de bugs, typos y balances se tardan mucho por cada entrega, y a veces las adiciones no son las más satisfactorias. Si Towns adquiere un mejor ritmo en sus mejoras, o permite el involucramiento de terceras personas para su desarrollo, tal vez haya futuro, pero por ahora se ve amauterístico, inacabado y muy atrás de sus ambiciones.","Towns is a game in beta about managing fantasy towns, complete with their respective catacombs, heroes, and fabulous creatures. It's the opposite of Dungeon Keeper and is heavily inspired by Dwarf Fortress. Like Gnomoria, Goblin Camp, Dwarves!, and A Game of Dwarves, it attempts to implement aspects missing from its model, while also subtracting layers of complexity and esotericism from the Adams brothers' cult game, resulting in a product that's accessible and entertaining for a few hours.

For a very independent project, following in the footsteps of a game as restrictive and obscure as Dwarf Fortress, Towns is a decent project. However, it's not without its problems.

The tutorial for learning how to control the Townies, a welcome (and necessary) inclusion in this type of simulator, is narrated by a sort of advisor. The problems begin when you notice that the developers' native language is Spanish, and the English text is poor and often confusing. As of version 14, the most recent to date, the tutorial doesn't recognize some commands and instructions, and in my case, I have no audio at all (the audio itself isn't very good or engaging, as far as I remember from version 9).

The isometric graphics with two-dimensional sprites aren't pleasing to the eye, reminiscent of Zynga's much-maligned Farmville. Townies lack charm, and items and equipment sometimes hang in an inelegant manner. Attempting to create a clean and mouse-friendly interface, Towns fails by not offering enough keyboard hotkeys, and some of the building menus can be missed if you don't click in the correct place, forcing you to go through the entire menu system again.

As for certain gameplay elements, such as decoration, they are unnecessarily complicated (even more so than in Dwarf Fortress) and limit the style of play you want to adopt.

Updates to these types of bugs, typos, and balances take a long time per release, and sometimes the additions aren't the most satisfactory. If Towns improves at a faster pace, or allows third-party involvement in its development, perhaps there's a future, but for now it feels amateurish, unfinished, and far behind its ambitions."

However, it seems development has been discontinued, so if there won't be any more content added, I think it will get boring towards the end.
In the early stages, your main focus is avoiding enemy mobs and ensuring a stable food supply, but in the middle stages you'll spend a lot of time exploring underground, trading, gathering heroes,
forming parties, and building houses and towns. However, in the later stages it becomes a game of underground exploration and work.

[b]Towns is sadly full of wasted potential. [/b] On paper, it had everything going for it: resource gathering, micro management, needs of villagers, crafting, construction and combat. Instead, everything is implemented in a basic way that for some reason just doesn't work, and ends up being a clusterfuck, to put bluntly. The screenshots showcasing busy townfolk running around a bustling city look amazing, but don't be fooled: whilst it's true a picture says a thousand words, gameplay says a thousand words + 1.

The interface is ugly and obstructive, thankfully though the buttons can be minimised. The entire game looks like a free game you play on those Flash sites. Not necessarily bad I must add, but surely if they took a backseat towards the visual department, then they could have pumped more beans into the gameplay side of things? Apparently not.

[b] Main game problem: Artificial Intelligence. The villagers lack any kind of soul and brain, that makes the NPCs in Doom and Quake more likeable. [/b]  They'll randomly dart across the landscape for no apparent reason, and the way they slide across the place looks freaky. They have no goals and just stand there doing nothing, permanently frozen in an upright stance for eternity (except when they die they rotate 90 degrees). Order them to chop down a forest, and they'll just fly towards the area en mass, stand completely motionless in front of the tree and it magically dissapears, through use of sound effects. Couldn't they at least have the sprite of an axe in their hand?
	[b] About their intelligence, they just come across as mindless drones. [/b]  Granted, they actually do a very good job of following orders: ask them to hack down some trees, mine some rock and what not, and they'll literally drop everything, rush towards the area like a bunch of gophers and gleefully carry out said task until it's done. If only public service workers in real life were as committed as these folk are. 
	[b] On the other hand, the villagers lack any sense of self preservation. [/b]  They'll often, for no reason at all, decide to wonder to the complete opposite end of the map and get killed (or raped rather, due to the bad animations) by some high level monsters. Then again for some unknown reason, another villager will decide it's their turn to dash to the other end of the map and repeat this morbid process. It's extremely frustrating as there is no explanation nor solution to this phenomenon, I've actually lost an entire village due to this sick process. If it's not a bug and actually some invisible monster using mind control on my villagers to turn them into suicidal lemmings, than I do apologise.

[b] Remember when I said before about game features being basic, yet for some reason not actually working? [/b]  Well here's an example. I tell a villager to go bake some bread, he does so without delay. Next to the bakery is a designated area for storing bread. Said villager then bakes the bread, and takes the finish products to the store room. Simple right? What actually happens is SOME bread gets put in the store room, whilst the rest is just littering the floor of the bakery, for no explained reason. And now the villagers are eating the bread off the dirty floor INSTEAD of the stockpile, despite the stockpile being closer to them. And again for some unknown reason, some of the villagers decide to find food in the dangerous jungles be yonder, rather than pluck it from the safety of their own town. Maybe they suffer from wheat and gluten allergy?

[b] OK, good things. City building is decent enough, as the villagers will happily carry out construction, even when they are dying of starvation: [/b]  a problem with other city building games is that sometimes buildings weren't been built because the villagers were too busy with other trivial tasks or ""idleing"", so props to Towns for fixing this common issue (even if it's due to bad AI). You can custom build your houses block by block, choosing a variety of different colours, furniture, etc, and decorate the surrounding area with plants and other decorations. So in essence, Towns does actually deliver what the name implies, assuming you can get past the bugs and terrible AI, and the fact is you need the AI to get the most out of Towns.


[b] Finally, there is only one, ONE single 2 or so minute long music loop that plays throughout the entire game. [/b]  Do yourself a favour, switch that damn thing off and play something in the background of Youtube, as this single endless loop will drive you absolutely insane.


[b] Towns is a massive disappointment, considering the hype and broken promises the developers blew around. [/b]  It actually got abandoned after it was pushed out of beta and into its final, albeit broken release state. I guess they jumped onto the city building craze every other indie game was doing, but didn't have the know-how on how to actually make a game properly. It's a colossus shame as Towns could have very well become a massive hit and a new standard for village building games. If the original developers were to release the game engine/source code for open modification, that could potentially completely turn this game into a success as I bet there's many talented people out there just hoping to get their hands on this and fix all the problems.
There's tons of other similar games that does everything way better. And for the record, to end the Towns vs Gnomoria debate, Gnomoria wins tenfold. At the time of writing, I've only spent 3 hours in Towns, as opposed to 65 hours in Gnomoria. Don't need to say more.

There's tons of other similar games that does everything way better. And for the record, to end the Towns vs Gnomoria debate, Gnomoria wins tenfold. At the time of writing, I've only spent 3 hours in Towns, as opposed to 65 hours in Gnomoria. Don't need to say more.

So, Towns. Oh boy, where to begin...

This game is not a game for casual play. It's not a traditional game (although I will always believe it helped pave the way for an emerging genre) like most people will expect, and it's not most peoples' defenition of ""easy"".

It's a game where you get out what you put in, and then some. But the catch is, the ""and then some"" is an exponential value. After a while, you realise that you've gone from mildly interested, to challenged, to excited, to inspired, to totally hooked. 

Now, in all fairness, the initial challenge is steep. Like I said, it's not an easy game, it's not pick-up-and-play-and-eventually-win.  In fact, Towns is designed to encourage experimentation and multiple approaches. There are no unlocks, it's quite possible to take your first town through the whole game and reach the ""end""... but to get there, you'll need to unlock your own creativity and disaster management skills. That takes practice, plain and simple. But like any hobby, after that initial investment the first wave of reward convinces you to keep going, and after that it just gets better and better.

Towns gets a lot of flak. Partly that's because it is genuinely lacking in content - at least, compared to what the content was obviously intended to be. However, I'm convinced that the flak is only spat so vigorously because Towns forces players to take a look at themselves and their own play style. In my view, a lot of the complaints are based off of the horrible realisation that some people just can't get their heads around the new strategies required to do well at this game. Because Towns is a game of strategy. It takes a keen perception and a lot of understanding to see the strategy in all its layers, but there is an underlying logic that is oh so satisfying to crack.

That's not to say this is a game only for super-nerds. Rather, it requires a bit of patience and a bit of humour, plus a healthy curiosity. The patterns are simple enough once you spot them, and infinitely scaleable - that's the beauty of this game. Once you crack one challenge, you can expand and expand that solution and take the same basic logic into other challenges. That's not attractive to some players, but for others it's an absolute joy.

Fortunately, there's a free demo - so you can see for yourself whether you enjoy that challenge or not. 

I wholeheartedly reccomend this game to anyone who is prepared to invest the time and open themselves to the experience. It's not what everyone will enjoy, but those who enjoy it will enjoy it a lot. If you're sick of the instant-gratification games, the ones with no substance or originality; if you just want to deeply engage with a challenge and figure it out; if you're the kind of person who thinks ""gah, this is so complex... I love it, how do I solve this?"", then Towns may well be one of the games you never entirely forget.","TRY THE DEMO!

Lots of playtime pre-Steam. Game still has most the bugs it did when it was alpha. IMO the biggest bug is that your people work themselves to death, literally, they forget to eat and starve. Got one town up to 70 population, only to see them starve to death in the next 2 hours to to 5. After that I deleted it, being that was the upteenth town that did that.

One of the patches made all the townies rock climbers, so you only need the first set of stairs. And then you get to watch them all race down into to the depths, to fight and die. Heroes are the ones that are supposed to go fight the monsters, not your townies. Once you've collected all that loot and minerals, you're left thinking, what do I do with it. Since there really isn't much to make, I think there's only 1 item made out of gold. So you have that hero running around with that wooden sword you made because he's too stupid to pick up that magical sword that was found. So usually one of your townies will equip it. You can tell them what to equip, but it's a click fest just to get it done. Your townies are kinda stupid too, they just drop everything on the ground rather then put it into containers that are right next to them (that was also int he alpha).

Want to have more fun? Turn on sieges and get wiped out before you even make that the second crafting table your need. Last time I played with siege's on (that's where the monsters can attack you town up top, not counting what the heroes pull to your town), I had just made my first workstation, and here came the spiders, they killed off most of my townies and then the rest of them were wiped out by the next 2 sieges that were 5 minutes apart. 

Games are supposed to be fun and keep the player active and interested. This game doesn't do that. This is also the only game I know of where the player is penalized for being active. So if you're constanly giving them orders, none will show up. I used to go watch tv so they could have 'idle time. 

I heard that there was a patch that came out for this. From what I understood of it, it did minor fixes and made it playable on some other OS so they could suck more money from unsuspecting buyers.

How strange my original review of this poor game disappeared. Might have been deleted by the devs due to me stating that they have a new game they want you to buy. I forget the name of that one. However I intend to avoid anything these guys work on it the future if I possibly can. They abandoned this  BETA because they got bored and started playing the blame game. Who's to say they won't do it again. One dev even bragged in the Steam forums that he took a months vacation in South America from the profits.  How about finishing the game?

So if you want a game that penalizes you, gets boring, frustrating and is incomplete, go ahead and buy this.","This game is not complete, even though they it's not listed as Early Access.

The devs have not continued the game, if you purchase this game (at a price far too high for what it should be), then you are supporting developers who have inethically abandoned a game. Do not buy this. If you have a friend who has this game, it's better to just download it from them and play it from that. The best thing about this game is that it's DRM free.

Full Review:

Towns is a game that is well known for being abandoned by the developers. It was created and sold many copies, and then later abandoned.

So the game is given all these bad reviews for being abandoned, however the content itself isn't bad. It has a few glitches, none of which I've experienced being game breaking, mostly just visual. The game is small in size, and runs well. It's graphically not the best, but it's not terrible either. The music is basic, and there isn't much of it. The actual town building aspect has a good amount of stuff to it. It has good management tabs, but ordering your townies is slightly strange. There is a fair amount of content and as a town builder you can do quite a lot with it. The content of the game is actually pretty good.

So should you buy this game? No. If the game sold for less than $3, then it would be better. However for $15 you could much better games that are much more worth it. If this game got continued, then perhaps it could be better too. However, right now, it has been abandoned and is not worth it for the price of the game.","Summary: Towns is a good game, in a beta-like state.

Towns has the potential to be that awesome crossover, but it is not. 

Although listed as a finished game it feels very much as an Alpha. The control over the ""Townies"" is extremely limtied, and each map begins the same way : a horrible struggle.

The question is why is it a horrible struggle? Right off the bat there are a number of monsters covering the surface of the map, many are able to kill a townie 1 versus 1. The townies will engage anything they encoutner and unlike the ""Heroes"" do not ever disengage until one of them is dead. So very early on your main task is gathering resources but in very controlled ways to avoid your townies by chance encounter a monster.

So you lost some townies, how does one get them back? Well you will need to have rooms built individually for each town plus any extras you want, they must be well furnished and food must flow in abundance, this together allows them to maintain their happiness which will entice others to join. Here is the kicker: work quickly saps happiness, so when you lose a townie or two the others must work twice as hard to provide happiness. I am sure you can see the paradox happenning.

Ofcourse many other small time problems persist throughout the game which make building anything close to the promos provided to be a long, long way away. Sure this sounds like the right approach, you cannot build a city over night, but the truth is you will spend many weeks before seeing anything resembling a couple huts.

I played this game before it came out on steam (so my hours played is wrong), i was in an area with no internet and had a new computer so i only had towns installed because it looked like a promising game; with awesome stuff to build, nice customization (many blocks and armours) and a cool endgame with adventurers helping your town, but after some hours of playing i'd rather just look at a plain wall for three days. 

The stuff you see in the screenshots are quite ""end game"", even the most simple structures, your ""townies"" will most often sleep eat and work outside because you won't be bothered building houses because the building system is VERRY frustrating because:
1. Your townies do not indicate whether or not they can build something unlike Dwarf-Fortress and Gnomoria and your townies can't reach shit.
2. Most building-blocks require some weird-arse items like slime ""stuff"" (can't remember name and this game is to horible to back and look) to make some stone bricks. Why? I don't know but it hampers creativity.
3. You can't build floors unlike DF or Gnomoria so every story you add you need an extra layer just for floors (this may have canged, it was a long time since i played)

There is a solution for the reatching problem and that is ""scafolding"" a block that can be stood upon, walked troug and climbed up. it's completley free so it feels like cheating using it. In other games that adds a scafolding sort of thing they usually cost resorces because scafolding tends to be realy good for moving around. The scafolding tool has been dubed a ""god tool"" by the comunity because it is realy OP. Other god tools are things like the ability to drop lava anywhere on the map.

10402780,russian,2014.05.09 08:33,✅,✅,0.5897436142,4,"Проведя в этой игре 100 часов, Я могу сказать, что это один из лучших градостроительных симуляторов. Да, она не идеальна. Да, у неё слабый графон (хотя это далеко не признак). Да, она без цели и смысла. Но это и позволяет нам придумывать свой собственный смысл. Разве не для этого делают подобные игры песочницы? Тот же Minecraft - смысла нет, а игра популярнейшая. 

Косвенная система управления поселенцами вносит долю хардкора в эту игру, а кубическая система, как лично по мне, лучше всего подходит для подобных игр. Без деления на эти квадратики ни одна игра подобного жанра хорошо не зайдёт. Мне нравится, как тут сделали систему подземелий. И нравятся, естественно, герои - всегда хочется иметь парня под рукой, который будет делать всё за тебя (пусть даже и воровать).

Ясно-понятно, что этой игре не хватает многих вещей. Да, можно сделать сюжет. Да, можно сделать воду более обитаемой. Да, можно сделать большее количество блоков. Можно сделать систему прокачки не только героям, но и обычным жителям: кто-то будет печь хорошие булочки, а кто-то будет ковать прочные доспехи. Карты, конечно же, нужно сделать больше, в десятки раз больше, ибо эти чистятся за пару дней игры.

В целом эта игра - шедевръ. Только надо её немного отшлифовать и будет сверкать на Солнце, затмевая другие игры. Разработчикам, конечно же, удачи!","Having spent 100 hours in this game, I can say it's one of the best city-building simulators out there. Yes, it's not perfect. Yes, its graphics are weak (though that's far from a negative). Yes, it's purposeless and meaningless. But that's precisely what allows us to create our own meaning. Isn't that what sandbox games are all about? Take Minecraft—it's meaningless, yet incredibly popular.

The indirect settler management system adds a touch of hardcore to this game, and the cube system, in my opinion, is the best fit for this kind of game. Without these cubes, no game in this genre would work well. I like the dungeon system here. And, naturally, I like the heroes—you always want a guy at your side who'll do everything for you (even if they steal).

It's clear this game lacks a lot. Yes, it could have a story. Yes, it could have made the water more habitable. Yes, it could have had more blocks. We could implement a leveling system not only for heroes but also for ordinary citizens: some would bake good buns, while others would forge durable armor. The maps, of course, need to be bigger, dozens of times bigger, as these ones can be cleaned up in a couple of days of play.

Overall, this game is a masterpiece. It just needs a little polishing, and it will shine in the sun, outshining other games. Good luck to the developers, of course!"

Je veux dire, je l'avais payé une somme ridicule, et il avait l'air sympa (et on pouvait même jouer en cours vues les perfs qu'il demandait). Mais... mais en fait non. Si vous voulez au début, vous avez votre village, vous le développez, et vous avez un peu de mal à avoir tout ce qu'il faut pour construire ce que vous voulez, mais vous vous dites que c'est parce que vous êtes débutant et que ça viendra avec le temps. Le problème, c'est qu'avec le temps ça ne vient pas non plus. A chaque fois que vous voulez construire quelque chose de nouveau, vous avez besoin de deux, trois, voire quatre étapes intermédiaires à construire puis à utiliser pour construire votre objet final. Etapes intermédiaires que vous n'utiliserez sans doute plus jamais par la suite.
Et il y un autre problème considérable : les gens meurent. Oui c'est un fait les gens meurent, mais dans ce jeu votre population sera décimée en moins de deux. Vous vous développez tranquilement lorsque tout à coup, le premier meurt, laissant un tas de cendre. Puis un deuxième, puis un troisième. Vous apprenez qu'ils n'ont pas à manger, mais ils ne mangent pas quand vous leur donnez de la nourriture ! Et ils sont finalement achevé par un fantôme du passé qui les déciment tous sans exception en leur passant dessus. Et à ce moment votre sauvegarde ne vaut plus rien puisque plus personne n'est là pour faire fonctionner votre ville.
Selon la description du jeu, le but de celui-ci est de développer une ville pour que des héros viennent passer un peu de temps avant d'aller affronter d'horribles choses pas trop loin de chez vous. Je n'ai jamais vu un seul héros de tout le temps que j'y ai joué.

Cependant, je trouve qu'il est cruel de mettre un pouce rouge à ce jeu, et je demanderais à tous ceux qui se plaignent de lire ce qui suit : 
[url]http://www.townsgame.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=10615[/url]
Comme l'expliquent les développeurs, le jeu était parti sur de mauvaises bases, et tout était à refaire, et c'était impossible. Je regrette d'avoir acheté ce jeu, parce qu'il faut le dire, il n'est pas fini et surtout que ce n'est peut être pas mon genre de jeux. Mais j'aurais préféré voir ses développeurs le continuer, d'autant plus qu'ils ont réussi à en vendre 200 00 exemples, réunissant ainsi des bénéfices de plus de deux millions d'euros...","At first, I thought this game was absolutely fantastic. I mean, I paid a ridiculous amount of money for it, and it looked fun (and you could even play it in class given the performance it demanded). But... but actually, no. If you want to, at the beginning, you have your village, you develop it, and you have a little trouble getting everything you need to build what you want, but you tell yourself that it's because you're a beginner and that it will come with time. The problem is that it doesn't come with time either. Every time you want to build something new, you need two, three, or even four intermediate stages to build and then use to build your final object. Intermediate stages that you will probably never use again.
And there's another considerable problem: people die. Yes, it's a fact, people die, but in this game your population will be decimated in less than two. You're quietly developing when suddenly, the first one dies, leaving a pile of ash. Then a second, then a third. You learn they don't have anything to eat, but they don't eat when you give them food! And they are finally finished off by a ghost from the past who decimates them all without exception by running over them. And at that point, your save is worthless since no one is there to run your city.
According to the game's description, the goal is to develop a city so that heroes can spend a little time before going to face horrible things not too far from home. I never saw a single hero in the entire time I played it.

However, I find it cruel to give this game a thumbs-down, and I would ask anyone complaining to read the following:

As the developers explain, the game was off to a bad start, and everything had to be redone, which was impossible. I regret buying this game, because it must be said, it's not finished, and especially because it might not be my kind of game. But I would have preferred to see its developers continue it, especially since they managed to sell 200,000 copies, thus generating profits of over two million euros..."

Its hard to describe because the game WAS (the devs gave up once they got the $) getting patched so broken things were removed... and then new broken things were added in but here is a list of what I found the most broken.

1. Building is not fun.  There is no easy copy and paste for buildings.  And if there is, then it is hidden under the games terrible interface.  It can take a lot of effort of placing certain building blocks in certain orders to build a house with the clunky building controls.  But then if you have to do it at least 20 more times if you want to get townies.  It can take a while.

2.  The interface is horrible.  The labels are off.  It just felt clunky.  First you have to click one menu button, then you have to click a sub menu button and find what you want.  Then if its something like wheat and you want it to be bread you have to go into more menus and submenus to find what you want.  The bread making tools and blocks should all be on the same page not scattered around.

3.  Your villagers are idiots.  They have no clue how to do anything without dieing.  Horrible monsters attacking?  Don't worry, your villagers will just stand there and die instead of running.  Sometimes they run indoors but most of the time go around doing what they normally do.  Their are even some maps with randomly wandering enemys, I dont have a problem with that but they do it so poorly in Towns.  In the snow maps one stray yeti can just wander on over and kill EVERYONE.  Also they will run though hell and back...to get stone.  I have seen them go on some brave runs just to get a basic resource.  You got to give them credit.  They will stop are nothing to drag that junk back to the stockpile... even if they all die in the process.

4.  The monsters that attack your village come out of THIN AIR.  You would think they would come from any dungeon entrances you have but they seem to pop out of midair at times.  

5.  Monsters are either really OP or really easy.  I watched a guard kill five slimes once.  Then I watched three guards with iron gear just get massacred by ONE wearpig. (Which is actually a common enemy.  Any normal pig could be a wearpig.)  

6.  Hero's are broken.  I must have done EVERYTHING I could think of to attract a hero.  They never come.  They are broken.  That or the system is terrible.  Either way the game dosen't explain things and after browsering the web for a while I still can't get damn Heros.  Worst part is.  You need heros to clear dungeons, but you can never get them it seems.

7  The way you make your townies happy is stupid.  They mainly get happy from eating.  Problem is, if you have food that fills them up a lot and dosen't make them eat as often.  YOU GET PUNISHED.  I actally tested this at one point by making bread fill 1500%.  Sure enouth happyness dropped to zero because they were not eating.   You can do a few other things like have badger fights (which seem broken) and put decorations but it seems food is what they want the most.  So remember, just spam cakes.  Anything that actually fills their stomachs is bad.  They don't want to be full.  THey want to be hungry.  Makes zero sense.    

8.  Last thing I am going to mention is the dungeons...THEY ARE EVERYWHERE.  It seems I can't dig down at all without hititng a dungeon on most map.s  I just wan't some stone but the game shoves the dungeons everywhere.  They cover the whole map when they should be deep underground and have SMALL entrances.    

Now things may have changed since I wrote this but this is what I encountered when I played the game.  And maybe some of the issues I mentioned have easy fixes but there is a problem...THE GAME SHOULD EXPLAIN IT THEN.  There is no tutorial.  Well there claims to be one but it just starts you off on fixed map without telling you much.  You have to find the message log and it tells you to do basic stuff.  Nice they have one at all but it never explains the fine details of the game.  Just the basic crude that I could probably figure out just by expermenting.","The game is broken.  Bottem line.

It was rather obvious months ago that they were not serious about continuing to support the product that was released, especially as they repeatedly failed to deliver on expectations and sales declined.

I hope they enjoy their money, it's obvious now that it is not going back into Towns development as was implied when I bought the game on Steam Early Access. I also hope they didn't spend it all, because I will never buy another game from these jokers after watching them get handed bags of cash during Steam Early Access only to have them fail to reinvest those funds to improve the product.

Wineを通していないSteamで遊べるのは良い。実際Ubuntuで遊べています。Linuxで遊べて要求スペックが低めなのはいいところです。実際、Linux対応のゲームでも、Linuxで遊ぶ場合はWindowsよりも必要なスペックが上がりますからね。


このゲームは、最初の11人に指示を出し、町を作るなどして人口を増やしたりするゲーム。
MAPによっては、開始地点が悪いとあっさり全滅してしまいます。始めは運も必要です。

AIが良くないのでしょうか、近くに置く場所を設置しても、遠くに設置した置き場に持って行こうとすることも良くあるため、街が大きくなるとより効率の悪い状態になります。位置よりも設置した時期を優先しているのでしょうか？


タイトルがタイトルなだけに、攻略方法やらMODやらの情報を集めたりするのが困難です。いや、そんなに種類もないかもしれないけれど。ワークショップ対応してから終了してほしかった。
（今となっては似たようなゲームも増えて、MODを作ろうとするユーザーが出てくるかどうかは怪しいが）


開発が終了しなければ、おすすめにしていました。AIの改善等をして欲しかったのですが、残念です。Townsが面白くないというわけではありませんが、似ているゲームはあります。

買うならセール待ちでも良いでしょう。","I'll say it first: it's fun and I played it for a long time, but I wouldn't recommend it.

It's good that you can play it on Steam without using Wine. I can actually play it on Ubuntu. The low spec requirements on Linux are a good thing. In fact, even games that are compatible with Linux have higher specs when played on Linux than on Windows.

This game involves giving instructions to 11 characters and increasing the population by building towns and other means.
Depending on the map, a bad starting location can easily wipe you out. You also need luck at the start.

Perhaps the AI ​​isn't very good, but even if you set up a nearby storage location, it often tries to take the item to a storage location farther away, making it even more inefficient as the town gets bigger. Does it prioritize the time of installation over location?

Given the title, it's difficult to gather information on strategies and mods. Well, maybe there aren't that many options, though. I wish they had added workshop support before discontinuing the game.
(Nowadays, there are a lot of similar games, so it's doubtful that there will be any users willing to create mods.)

If development hadn't ended, I would have recommended it. I wish they had improved the AI, but unfortunately, they haven't. It's not that Towns isn't fun, but there are other similar games out there.

With that said, I still spent an enjoyable month or so playing this game. Coming from Dwarf Fortress and wanting something a little prettier, this game provides a nice twist on the genre, rather than mining you ""dig too deep"" by hiring heroes who explore dungeons.

It provides an interesting and detailed tech tree, one of the best workshop designs I have seen in any such game (you place zones for workshops and then crafting stations within zones).

That said, I am obsessed with this genre and desperate for other games in it. If you want to try something like this but with active development and far more polished, I highly recommend Gnomoria (and keeping an eye on Stonehearth and Clockwork Empires).

I would still recommend this game, although given it is unlikely to see any updates I would personally want to see the price knocked down a little given its incomplete state.

I really hope the new developer breathes new life into this game, but I feel like once the game gets into a negative feedback cycle developers have little incentive to do so -- when everyone is panning your game on Steam and no updates have been released for a year and a half, what is your incentive to continue working on it?

A sad fortune, because the game really did have promise.

Edit: It seems someone has been appointed to further develop this game. If this is the case, the outlook should be more positive."

분명히 답답한 부분... 시민들이 다들 정신이 해까닥 했는지 피떨어지면 영웅도 도망가는데

지들은 죽을때까지 끝까지 싸운다. 게다가 아군이 지원하러 왔으면 뒤로 빠질만도 한데 절대 물러서는 법이 없다 ㄷㄷ

그리고 집 짓는 방법이라든지 부족한 설명 덕분에 몇번이고 헤매는 자신을 볼 수 있다...

적의 수준은 약간 하드하게 되어 있다. 초반에는 굉장히 신경써야할  부분.  앞에서 말했다 시피 도망가는

뇌기능이 없어서 세심한 컨트롤이 필요하다...

그래도 영웅 키우는 재미나 지붕쌓는(!?) 재미가 있으니까 하는중.. ㅋㅋㅋ

영웅도 밸런스붕괴가 있고 인공지능은 모든것을 덮을 정도로 심각하다.. ㅜ

단순히 싸우다가 죽을 성 싶으면 도망가는 것인데, 뻔히 길 두고 죽는 모습이 여러번 보인다...

다행인 것은 몬스터보다는 발이 빨라서 순식간에 도망간다는 것. 하아,,,,

답답한 게 한두가지가 아니지만 그나마 계속 개발중이라는게 마음에 위안이 된다!!

일해라 모비어스!","As of 2014-03-04 (7/10)

It's definitely frustrating... The civilians are all out of their minds, and even heroes run away when they're out of blood.

They fight to the death. Plus, if allies come to support, they might retreat, but they never back down. ㄷㄷ

And because of the lack of explanations, like how to build houses, you'll find yourself getting lost several times...

The enemies are a bit tough. You'll need to be extremely careful in the early stages. As I mentioned before, running away

requires careful control because the brain isn't working properly...

Still, I'm still playing because it's fun to raise heroes and build roofs (!?). LOL

The heroes also have balance issues, and the AI ​​is so severe that it overwhelms everything. ㅜ

They should simply run away when they're about to die, but I've seen them die many times, clearly leaving the path open...

The good news is that they're faster than monsters, so they can run away in an instant. Sigh,,,,

It's frustrating in so many ways, but the fact that development is still ongoing is a comfort to me!!

When describing Towns to people, I decided it was like telling 10 people how to play minecraft… but without the patterned crafting.  So much of minecraft is lived in telling someone where to put something in a 3x3 grid, but in towns you just say ""Go make a wooden sword"" and they must goto the wiki on their own and look it up.

Towns places you in the traditional omniscient 3rd person viewing angle that Christ himself enjoys.   You get a randomly generated world with 11 citizens of your ""Town"".  You drop orders for what to do, and the citizens go do it.  Chop down all these trees I've moused over.  Harvest this apple tree.  Build this wall.  Dig this tunnel.  Oh crap, there's spiders in that tunnel.  No, no don't die… run away… crap.

And then you start a new game and realize there's much more you need to do before you plumb the depths of your little block world.

Towns is an impressively deep game where it does not appear to be on the surface.  I mean that literally as well as figuratively as while at the surface of the game it's about Townsperson happiness management (oh yea, they need to be happy, not over worked and if you can manage that, you'll get more people showing up in town… that's an important mechanic that I didn't think of until now… see… deep) and setting up replenishable resources so everyone doesn't starve and you've got plenty of wood for that epic barbarian castle you just dreamt up.  Dig down only a couple layers and there's combat to be had.  Not super impressive combat, just your people wiggling at the beast until one of them makes this strange death noise.  You can't control the combat at all.  Soldiers can be designated, even set on patrol routes, but they intervene somewhat rarely which makes taking them off labor to just stand around with the best sword you've made so far a little useless.

Again, this game goes so much deeper than I'm giving it credit for in this review… suffice to say, it's quite enjoyable. If you like economy heavy RTS, dwarf-likes or civilization games give it a whirl.  I recommend buy-in at $10, but that's only because it's a little bit of a gamble as to wether you'll like it.  I'd be willing to give this game $25, but that's knowing how much I enjoy it after playing it for hours.

Hello everybody,

I login to the forums to make you all know the current game situation. Have to say that this news won't like the most of you.

Towns v14b will be the last build we will release as SMP. I have no words or response of why I didn't post this months before. The only thing I can say, and I understand you don't care about it, is that I'm burned, really burned about the game and all it involves. I don't have the strenght to continue with it.

At some point we tried to hire someone to continue with the development, we also did some interviews to some nice coders. But at the end I messed that, because I'm so burned to show the code to other guy and explain him how all works. So we cancelled the hiring thing.

Not sure you will agree with me that v14b is a pretty good build, it solves some issues and add some new features. Adding more features won't change the game to a ""finished"" status, this is a never-ending story. So, I had to stop at some point and consider it finished, and I did that.


So, about the future.... we are still considering what can we do to make you happy, one of the possibilities means to make the code open source, but not sure that is a good option and we are debating what can we do.


I make this post ""replyable"" so you can post anything you want to, I will read and reply it.

Thanks and sorry.

News: IT WILL NEVER BE FINISHED.  Seriously.  Look at http://www.townsgame.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=11402.  They're done ""updating it.""

Basically, this was a Greenlight product that was released before it should have been.  This is the one game that made me completely cautious of ever supporting any Early Access title whatsoever- AND THIS WASN'T EVEN EARLY ACCESS.  IT WAS RELEASED AS A FINISHED PRODUCT.  FOR 15 DOLLARS.

This is a perfect example of what developers have the potential to do with your money.  Promise to make finished products and then back off and reap the rewards without any reprimand.  Sure, it sucks that the developer got burned out but he should have realized what he was doing before he was able to put this on Steam as a completed game.  And shame on Steam for allowing it.

Don't buy it.  Don't touch it.  Just don't."

AI in this game is poor.

Last update v14 was released in September, 2013. V13 was released in May, 2013. The changes that was implemeneted in these patches contains very few contents and minimun bug fixes. It seems like the developers just don't care or hoping that modders can fix everything for them.

LIke every other games in the same genre that's on greenlight, AI in this game is poor.

and there's a breakdown of their ""about the game"" info page on steam

""The game brings a fresh new take on the city building/management genre by introducing many RPG features. ""

Nope, there are many others just like it, the game is heavily inspired by many other game and it offers nothing ""fresh"" and ""new"".

""n Towns you manage a settlement on top of an active dungeon. Instead of playing the hero who delves deep into the dungeon, how about playing the town that houses and caters to the hero's needs?""

Heroes don't need jack. All it takes to attract heroes is to boost your population and have an area set up as ""tavern"". The ""tavern"" area doesn't have to be enclosed. Meaning that heores will be perfectly fine sleeping on the ground looking at stars just because you painted a 3x3 block purple and called it ""inn"".

There is no intereaction between your townsfolk and heroes at all. They have very poor AI and die very easily if you are new to the game. Gearing up these heroes is not an easy process and sometimes random. You need to put the items on their path or ""hangout"" area and hope that they pick up the gear you want them to wear. 

""Both the RPG and strategic aspects will be fleshed out over a series of sprawling dungeons.""

The only RPG elements involved in the dungeons is ""there are mobs, they drop loot"". The only strategic aspect of the game is ""pray to the gods that when you dig down, you don't dig directly into a group of mobs because your townsfolk are dumb and they will not flee"" and ""dig open dungeon walls bit by bit and hope your townsfolk don't try to engage the mobs""

There is minimun strategy and minimun RPG elements in this game. Townsfolk has a hunger bar, a sleep bar and a happiness bar and that's it. There is no ""leveling"" for your townsfolk and leveling for heores is meaningless.

""Attract travelling heroes that will independently explore the dungeons below, fight off monsters, gain levels, special skills and collect the best loot they can find in order to clear the land of all evil!""

Like stated above, there is no interactions between you and the heroes. 

About the loots, here's the funny part. Once you clear a dungeon, it's best not to collect loot from the dungeon because there's a billion of trash loot lying on the ground. Heroes will pick up gears when they feel like it. It's best to leave those in the dungeon.

The best loot is often not dropped in the dungeon. Once you have a market set up, travelling merchants will come and they will randomly sell you the best gear in the game. So in order to get the best loot in game, you priorites a market over anything else. Regardless your progression in the game, you will be able to buy best gears purely based on luck.

""Craft unique weapons, trade with exotic items, obtain randomized loot, set up devious death traps and build a settlement capable of holding back the forces that come up from the depths!""

Mobs in the dungeon will come to your town only when a hero engages them with low health and decides to run away. Those mobs will not stop chasing the fleeing hero until one of them is dead. This normally leads to a few townies dying because of the poorly designed AI. 

There is nothing unique about the weapon and item designs. They are very generic items. I wouldn't describe loots to be ""randomized"". 90% of them are trash loots and 99% of them are just junk on the ground waiting to be sold when a merchant arrives (if that merchant has enough money and willing to buy these crap. normally they just don't want them at all).

In summary, this game is not worth its asking price. Yes, it's about the price of a very fancy subway sandwitch in Canada but I assure you that you will get more satisfaction out of that sandwitch than this game. If you are desprately looking for a game like this, wait for it to go on sale and do not expect any updates because it's not very likely. 

There is a modding scene for this game. It's small and I suggest you to go to their forum and check out more information there. Simply google ""towns"" and you'll be able to access their website and forum. 

Thank you.","By general standard this is not a ""complete game""

Graphic of this game is....let's say retro.

AI in this game is poor.

Last update v14 was released in September, 2013. V13 was released in May, 2013. The changes that was implemeneted in these patches contains very few contents and minimun bug fixes. It seems like the developers just don't care or hoping that modders can fix everything for them.

LIke every other games in the same genre that's on greenlight, AI in this game is poor.

and there's a breakdown of their ""about the game"" info page on steam

""The game brings a fresh new take on the city building/management genre by introducing many RPG features. ""

Nope, there are many others just like it, the game is heavily inspired by many other game and it offers nothing ""fresh"" and ""new"".

""n Towns you manage a settlement on top of an active dungeon. Instead of playing the hero who delves deep into the dungeon, how about playing the town that houses and caters to the hero's needs?""

8817407,english,2014.00.23 14:52,❌,❌,0.5501369238,12,"The concept of this game is neat, but it is lacking a lot. I've played it a while ago, and I dare say it was a bit better back then than it is now. Development seems to be quite stagnant here. At the end of this review you'll read what I really recommend instead.

The tutorials are, to say the least, quite braindead. They could've made it more interactive, but as it is now it's quite dull. Some details seems to be badly written as I didn't always get the desired results.

The military in the game is kind of a joke. If I see a spider or any other enemy, why oh why can't I just go rightclick it and tell the military to go attack it? Or at least something that enables me to make more use of the military than 'patrol there' and hope that they actually will engage the enemy on their patrol routes.

The actual mining is quite non-intuitive. Somehow I wasn't able to mine certain areas until I moved up/down. It's rather hard to see what level you are at currently, and there are no size indicators in the area you're about to mark to be mined. And you can build a roof but somehow I have not managed to build a roof on top of my shacks. I might give that a try again another time, but the game seems so pointless that it isn't really motivating to.

You have absolutely no connection with those little guys you're ordering around. You can see some basic stats, but all those little peoples aren't really special. It's lacking a certain something there, and I can't quite place my finger on it. Let's just say that you don't really care who they are, as long as they get the jobs done already. There's no feel of a story attached to it.

Assigning jobs and assigning productions/stockpiles is quite a chore. So much a chore that you just leave everything up to the defaults. A quick overview is rather impossible. Sure, they do have a list of civilians, and a stockpile list. But instead of having it present a clear overview, it's rather a messy job. I think they focused way too much on iconized displays with tiny numbers inside. In cases like this, a table-format would probably make more sense. We want to know some nice numbers and some other stats, not how pretty they look in a circle with one tiny number in there.

Speaking about iconized displays.. the GUI is very clunky. It is definitely not polished and is just bare bones style. Nothing fancy about it and there are options lacking. The build icons are non-intuitive. If you want to go back a level in the menu, the 'go back' arrow is in a different location every level. So you can't just 'click click click' fast to get to the root level. No, you have to check every time you went back one level in the menu where the back button is at now. Nothing has been streamlined in this game.

If you are charmed by this kind of game, I can recommend a different one instead which is still in active development and is rather more promising. Take it from me, you want to try [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/224500]Gnomoria[/url].

If you find this game at $5 or less, then think about it, but any more than that and you might want to find something that got finished. This review is based off of my experience and the regular price though, so overall I don't recommend it. There's no way there isn't better games out there than this.

Let me start with what I found to be good about the game though, since I did technically like it. I never played this Gnomoria that everyone else is mentioning, and with little function in Minecraft for watching a village come to life even with mods, I found it to be a great idea. Even though it was immediately obvious from opening the game that it was far from finished I found myself enjoying finding different combinations and ways of getting my limited villagers to survive.

Secondly, the zoning. By assigning a zone type to an area the area gains a particular function, while losing other functions. This makes building a city kind of cool because the buildings one makes will actually function the way that they've zoned it to. Added to the fact that, if one could figure out the menus easily, one could get the villagers to use and upkeep these zones automatically, without any help from the player. 

Then there's just the world in general. Although the maps are small, they generate well, and they're fun and easy to shape. If a player shows enough patience, it actually is possible to build the kinds of places they show in the promotional material and screenshots.

The last thing I thought was really cool was being able to put writing on tombstones and books and things. I can go through my village and remind myself of the events that passed. Who died, who did the best, or helped the most – it felt like making a civilization, even though it was really just a town at best. Epic legacies in a tiny town.

Now, the wonderful negatives that ruined it. Unfortunately there are a lot of these, so I'll put a chunk of them in point form;
*Odd menu style. That took a while to get used too, and I feel like things could be implemented better.
*Moving items is a hassle, or just plain confusing.
*Can't place enough text in books, graves, signs, etc, and can't use characters like “/”, making labels and text look flat and odd, like they were written by some 10 year old that was too lazy to use any punctuation. Breaks immersion. 
*The use of scaffold isn't clearly stated to be useful, and so it can be difficult to find out about it and how to use it properly to build better buildings. There isn't a lot of direct help on the internet either, so simply building can be a hassle. Also, making second floors is too tricky.
*Extremely limited character sprites. Everyone will have too many clones for you to care about them. They also all have weird french-sounding names, even if playing the English version, and though unimportant, feels like it takes away from immersion into the game.
*The armour doesn't fit on the sprites properly. Sometimes this is funny, but it just isn't proper for a game that costs $15.
*The first floor dungeons, though easy to pass, are too expansive and too full of monsters. There's no easing into it at all, making the game feel less thought-out and more slapped together. Also an immersion breaker.
*Next to no updates. These people probably don't care anymore, and it's showing. They don't update anywhere near as much as they should, and some of the bugs in the game could really use some fixes.
*The bugs. Seriously, the game is definitely not a finished product. Amusing, but certainly not finished.

And lastly, though kind of silly, what I found to be the game-breaker; 
The weapons you make, buy, and find are cool and all, but it isn't hard for some ""hero"" to waltz by and take all your good stuff, leaving your citizens and soldiers pretty close to defenceless. Some heroes. I worked hard on that stuff. “That hat was for the blacksmith!” and “she needed that spear to save her life!” might become alarmingly common frustrations.

So yeah. Ends up under $5? It'll amuse you long enough. $15? It's cute, but it ain't that cute, just go back to your Minecraft mods and this ""Gnomoria"" everyone else is talking about.","I've got to say I'm glad I got it when it was on sale.

This review is based off of my experience and the regular price though, so overall I don't recommend it. There's no way there isn't better games out there than this.

Let me start with what I found to be good about the game though, since I did technically like it. I never played this Gnomoria that everyone else is mentioning, and with little function in Minecraft for watching a village come to life even with mods, I found it to be a great idea. Even though it was immediately obvious from opening the game that it was far from finished I found myself enjoying finding different combinations and ways of getting my limited villagers to survive.

Secondly, the zoning. By assigning a zone type to an area the area gains a particular function, while losing other functions. This makes building a city kind of cool because the buildings one makes will actually function the way that they've zoned it to. Added to the fact that, if one could figure out the menus easily, one could get the villagers to use and upkeep these zones automatically, without any help from the player. 

Then there's just the world in general. Although the maps are small, they generate well, and they're fun and easy to shape. If a player shows enough patience, it actually is possible to build the kinds of places they show in the promotional material and screenshots.

The last thing I thought was really cool was being able to put writing on tombstones and books and things. I can go through my village and remind myself of the events that passed. Who died, who did the best, or helped the most – it felt like making a civilization, even though it was really just a town at best. Epic legacies in a tiny town.

Now, the wonderful negatives that ruined it. Unfortunately there are a lot of these, so I'll put a chunk of them in point form;
*Odd menu style. That took a while to get used too, and I feel like things could be implemented better.
*Moving items is a hassle, or just plain confusing.
*Can't place enough text in books, graves, signs, etc, and can't use characters like “/”, making labels and text look flat and odd, like they were written by some 10 year old that was too lazy to use any punctuation. Breaks immersion. 
*The use of scaffold isn't clearly stated to be useful, and so it can be difficult to find out about it and how to use it properly to build better buildings. There isn't a lot of direct help on the internet either, so simply building can be a hassle. Also, making second floors is too tricky.
*Extremely limited character sprites. Everyone will have too many clones for you to care about them. They also all have weird french-sounding names, even if playing the English version, and though unimportant, feels like it takes away from immersion into the game.
*The armour doesn't fit on the sprites properly. Sometimes this is funny, but it just isn't proper for a game that costs $15.
*The first floor dungeons, though easy to pass, are too expansive and too full of monsters. There's no easing into it at all, making the game feel less thought-out and more slapped together. Also an immersion breaker.
*Next to no updates. These people probably don't care anymore, and it's showing. They don't update anywhere near as much as they should, and some of the bugs in the game could really use some fixes.
*The bugs. Seriously, the game is definitely not a finished product. Amusing, but certainly not finished.

And lastly, though kind of silly, what I found to be the game-breaker; 
The weapons you make, buy, and find are cool and all, but it isn't hard for some ""hero"" to waltz by and take all your good stuff, leaving your citizens and soldiers pretty close to defenceless. Some heroes. I worked hard on that stuff. “That hat was for the blacksmith!” and “she needed that spear to save her life!” might become alarmingly common frustrations.

So yeah. Ends up under $5? It'll amuse you long enough. $15? It's cute, but it ain't that cute, just go back to your Minecraft mods and this ""Gnomoria"" everyone else is talking about."

The menus are hard to navigate. There is no tutorial to speak of. You can instruct your citizens to build things, but if you do not have the supplies to make it, instead of telling you why you can't, it will sit, forever until you produce the needed materials or manually cancel the order. You cannot change the camera angle (which gets really aggravating). The perspective makes it really difficult build a lot of the structures shown on the store page. There is exactly one music track that will drive you absolutly crazy after a few hours of playing. Your citizens are difficult to direct.

ALL your assigned citizens will continue to drown themselves until you cancel the order, which is really hard to do, when it takes 5 seconds a person to drown and about 2 minutes for you to navigate to the cancel order screen, get to the right layer, and cancel the order. 

There is some good however. Once you look up on the wiki how to pretty much play the game, it becomes more of a meditative visual rather than an actual game. I stopped at about 40 citizens and just let them do their thing. They were feeding and growing and happy. They did not require any input from me. I watched them tear through dungeons and make food, build things. It was nice

I wouldn't bother checking the forums for any kind of clarity.  The current moderator bans anyone who criticizes the game, despite there being valid reasons to criticize.  Only the positive forum posts don't get edited or deleted.  Anyone trying to warn potential buyers on the actual status of the game, gets banned.

We were told that development had picked up again (for the fourth time of it being active and then subsequently stopped) but after only a month-ish, the current moderator stated the developer was having house renovations done and did not have regular internet access.  That was in September of 2014. 

Make your own judgement call from that...

**** Initial Review ****

Voted to Greenlight the game WAY back and upon it's release on Steam, I was excited to buy it.  

Imagine my shock when the game I loaded up was nothing more than a poorly coded alpha with a crap tutorial and a laundry list of game-breaking bugs.

According to the Devs, the game was fulling finished and wasn't in alpha/beta/whatever.  Fully finished. Fully playable.  With continued updates scheduled!  

Please note:  There was no demo released at the time.  NOWHERE on the page did it state that the game was feature incomplete (which is STILL is).  And then customers started voicing their concerns.  They (myself included) were met with insults from the PR/Devs directly (anyone remember TommyKent's abrasion?).  We were called stupid for not ""understanding"" how these type of games are to played.   That ""if we just gave it time"" we'd figure it all out.

Screw that.

Even over a year later, the game has only had a handful of crappy updates - most not even addressing major issues.  We've been told the entire run of excuses from health problems, to vacations, to quitting programmers (who left to work on other projects! AWESOME!)

Avoid this like the plague.  It was a cash grab.  They're millionaires now (not exaggerating) and they're never coming back to save this wreck of a game.  

Matter of fact, avoid anything SMP does.  I will be.","**** August 2015 Update ****

Niekoniecznie muszą to być hity albo produkcje dobre, gdyż swoją wyjątkowość potrafią okazywać na wiele różnych sposób, nawet w byciu zupełnie beznadziejnymi. Towns jest grą nietypową, jednak tak jak w przypadku innych – nie mogę się zdecydować, czy jej specyfika to coś dobrego, czy nie.

 

Jedenastu nas było

Gra jest trudna, skomplikowana i zagmatwana tak bardzo, że po długich godzinach nie odkryłem nawet połowy możliwości, jakie produkcja ta przedstawia. Na samouczek nie ma co liczyć – pokaże nam główne założenia, jednak wytłumaczy może z pięć opcji występujących w Towns na setki, które rzeczywiście powinny zostać wyjaśnione. 
Zaczynamy na kwadratowej mapie, obfitującej w rośliny, surowce i zwierzęta. Wszystko obserwujemy z rzutu izometrycznego, co przywodzi oczywiście na myśl wszelkie gry RTS. Po mapce kręci się jedenastu obywateli, którzy mają swoje imiona, potrzeby określone w współczynniku „szczęścia” i „głodu” oraz wyświetlone aktualne zadanie. Naszym celem jest zbudować wszystko, aby zapewnić im przetrwanie i satysfakcję z życia, nie wiedząc do czego służy połowa przycisków i jak działa większość stref. To właśnie na nich – na strefach – opiera się większa część systemu rządzącego grą. Znajdziemy wśród nich stolarza, kamieniarza, kuźnię, jadalnię, piekarnię, kwatery osobiste, szpital i wiele innych. Do niektórych z nich dostawić trzeba stoły z miejscem pracy, aby obywatele mogli produkować coraz to lepsze meble, narzędzia, jedzenie, itd. Oczywiście, na wszystko trzeba wytrzasnąć surowce, do których dostęp jest w miarę prosty. Drzewa rosną dosyć gęsto, kamienia również jest pod dostatkiem – a są to dwa najważniejsze i podstawowe surowce, których zabraknąć nigdy nie powinno. Drzewa oczywiście można zasadzić, co ułatwia znacząco dostęp do drewna, jest szansa też obsiać pola pszenicą, czy zrobić sobie sad z jabłoniami i gruszami. 

 

Nieskończone możliwości

Budować możemy, co dusza zapragnie. Jeśli tylko odkryjemy sposób, w jaki Towns działa, stworzyć możemy przepiękne miasta, zamki, jaskinie czy wioski, zgodnie z naszą wyobraźnią. Dzięki strefom, mieszkańcy będą spać tam, gdzie chcemy. Jeść, gdzie im pozwolimy i tak dalej. Widziałem zapierające dech w piersi budowle, choć sam nie mam pojęcia, jak osiągnąć choćby połowę z tego, gdyż moje podejścia zazwyczaj kończyły się wymarciem społeczności, zanim zdążyła osiągać cokolwiek. Działo się tak, gdyż nie miałem nieograniczonej kontroli nad moimi obywatelami – gdy kazałem im sadzić drzewa, szukali sadzonek nawet po drugiej stronie mapy, gdzie grasowały wrogo nastawione żaby z włóczniami. Nie było ocalałych…
Choć można powołać wojsko do życia, wyznaczyć im patrole lub kazać bronić wioski, to moi obrońcy zazwyczaj dochodzili do jaskini pełnej pająków, gdy zwłoki moich górników zaścielały już podłoże. Nie zostało wyjaśnione jak stworzyć można bohatera, których lista wyświetlana jest obok wojska. Nie wiadomo do końca jak działa szpital (choć miałem wszystkie możliwe w nim przedmioty, potrzebne w szpitalu i łóżko, to nikt z rannych nie udał się tam), w związku z czym szybko traciłem ludność. Jak się pewnie domyślacie, wskazówki, czy można ich rozmnożyć w jakiś sposób – również nie było. A gdy zostaje nam pięciu mieszkańców, cała praca idzie w ślimaczym tempie i grać się po prostu dalej nie chce.
Pikseloza 

Oprawa graficzna, która w charakterystyczny sposób zapisała się w dziale gier Indie, jest brzydka. Pikseloza, przywodząca na myśl jedne z pierwszych gier strategicznych. Nie ma co liczyć na skomplikowane animacje, czy na oszałamiające widoki – wszystko, czego uświadczymy, to uproszczone kwadraciki, zaścielające cały świat Towns. Ma to oczywiście swój urok, wiele ludzi uwielbia takie podejście do grafiki i nie ona jest tutaj najważniejsza. Dźwięki również są starodawne, więc i tutaj nie ma co liczyć na jakieś wyjątkowe i zachwycające nutki. W kółko leci ta sama muzyka, jest jeden dźwięk do ścinania drzewa, jeden do kopania i tak dalej. Choć grafika nie przeszkadza w grze, to jednostajna muzyka potrafi doprowadzić człowieka do szału, więc często albo wyłączałem głośniki (nic nie traciłem w ten sposób, gdyż reszta odgłosów również potrafi po czasie zirytować) albo zwyczajnie odpalałem własną ścieżkę dźwiękową w tle.

 

Gra wyjątkowa

Staję w taki oto sposób przed oceną całej gry i dalej nie wiem, co o niej myśleć i jak podsumować. Choć Townszachwyciło mnie swoją złożonością i mnogością możliwości, które pozwalają na zbudowanie społeczności swoich marzeń, na wzniesienie zamczysk, które będą tętnić życiem i pracą, to zarazem ta złożoność przytłoczyła mnie i sprawiła, że nie wiedziałem od czego zacząć i jak do tematu tak naprawdę podejść. 
Wszystkiemu winny jest samouczek, który potraktowany został po macoszemu. Może było to specjalne zamierzenie twórców, aby użytkownicy doszli do tego, jak się gra na metodzie prób i błędów, jednak jakiekolwiek nie były ich plany – takie rozwiązanie po prostu jest złe i psuje przyjemność z rozgrywki. Zdaję sobie sprawę, że Minecraft również nie miał najmniejszego wprowadzenia, jednak tam wszystko jest jakieś sensowne i oczywiste, pierwsze kroki postawić można bez zaglądania na wiki. Towns niestety jest bardziej skomplikowane i nie narzuca się w sposób oczywisty, co z tym wszystkim zrobić. 

 

Prawdziwy fan oczywiście znajdzie setki samouczków i wciągnie się dużo, dużo głębiej i będzie w stanie wyeksploatować maksimum z gry, ja jednak oceniam samą produkcję, nie fanowskie poradniki.
Dobrze więc, nie przeciągając już dłużej – jaki jest mój werdykt? Połączenie Minecrafta z The Settlers (również nie możemy bezpośrednio kontrolować swoich jednostek, tylko wydawać polecenia, które wykonają, jak będzie im się chciało – może to bardziej podobne akurat do Majesty?) jest zaiste grą wyjątkową, która zasługuje na uznanie za możliwości, jakie daje w ręce graczom. Jednak, póki nie wyjdzie do niej kilka większych patchy, usprawniających choćby wprowadzenie – dostaje silne siedem! Twórcy natomiast zapowiadają ciągłą pracę nad swoim dziełem, więc spodziewać się możemy wielu łatek, które zapewne wzniosłyby ocenę – może nawet o dwa oczka w górę.
Plusy

•	Irytująca muzyka","Every now and then, not very often, exceptional games come along. These don't necessarily have to be hits or good productions, as they can express their uniqueness in many different ways, even down to being completely hopeless. Towns is an unusual game, but like many others, I can't decide whether its specificity is a good thing or not.

Eleven of Us

The game is difficult, complex, and confusing, so much so that after hours of playing, I haven't explored even half of the possibilities it offers. Don't count on a tutorial – it will only show you the main concepts, but it will explain maybe five of the hundreds of options in Towns that really need to be explained.

We start on a square map, abundant with plants, resources, and animals. Everything is observed from an isometric perspective, reminiscent of all RTS games. Eleven citizens roam the map, each with their own names, needs defined by their ""happiness"" and ""hunger"" stats, and a displayed task. Our goal is to build everything we can to ensure their survival and a fulfilling life, without even knowing what half the buttons are for or how most zones work. It is these zones – the zones – that form the basis of the game's system. Among them, we'll find a carpenter, a stonemason, a forge, a dining room, a bakery, personal quarters, a hospital, and many others. Some of these zones require workbenches so that the citizens can produce increasingly better furniture, tools, food, and so on. Of course, all of these require resources, which are relatively easy to access. Trees grow quite densely, and stone is also plentiful – these are the two most important and basic resources that should never be in short supply. Trees can, of course, be planted, significantly improving access to wood. There's also the opportunity to sow fields with wheat or create an orchard with apple and pear trees.

Endless Possibilities

We can build whatever our hearts desire. Once we figure out how Towns works, we can create beautiful cities, castles, caves, and villages, just as we imagine. Thanks to zones, citizens can sleep where we want, eat where we let them, and so on. I've seen breathtaking structures, though I have no idea how to achieve even half of them, as my attempts usually ended with the community dying out before it could achieve anything. This happened because I didn't have unlimited control over my citizens – when I told them to plant trees, they searched for seedlings even on the other side of the map, where hostile frogs with spears prowled. There were no survivors…
Although you can raise an army, assign them patrols, or order them to defend the village, my defenders usually reached a cave full of spiders just as the corpses of my miners littered the ground. There was no explanation for how to create a hero, whose list is displayed next to the army. It's unclear exactly how the hospital works (even though I had all the necessary items and a bed, none of the injured went there), so I was rapidly losing population. As you can probably guess, there was also no hint of how to reproduce them. And when you're down to five residents, work moves at a snail's pace, and you simply don't want to continue playing.

Pixelosis

The graphics, which have become a hallmark of indie games, are ugly. Pixelation, reminiscent of some of the first strategy games. Don't expect complex animations or stunning vistas – all you'll see are simplified squares dotting the entire world of Towns. This, of course, has its charm; many people love this approach to graphics, and it's not the most important thing here. The sounds are also old-fashioned, so don't expect any unique or captivating musical notes here either. The same music plays over and over again: there's one sound for chopping down a tree, another for digging, and so on. While the graphics don't detract from the game, the monotonous music can drive you crazy, so I often either turned off the speakers (I didn't miss anything by doing so, as the other sounds can also become irritating after a while) or simply played my own soundtrack in the background.

Exceptional Game

I'm now faced with this assessment of the entire game, and I still don't know what to think or how to summarize it. While Townszach captivated me with its complexity and the multitude of possibilities that allow you to build the community of your dreams, to build castles that will be bustling with life and activity, this complexity also overwhelmed me, leaving me unsure where to begin or how to truly approach the topic.

The tutorial, which was treated so poorly, is to blame for everything. Perhaps this was the developers' intention, allowing users to figure out how to play through trial and error, but whatever their plans, such a solution is simply wrong and spoils the fun of the game. I realize that Minecraft didn't have the slightest introduction either, but everything there is sensible and obvious; you can take the first steps without consulting the wiki. Unfortunately, Towns is more complex and doesn't offer a clear explanation of what to do with it all.

A true fan will, of course, find hundreds of tutorials and delve much deeper, being able to maximize the game's potential. However, I'm judging the game itself, not the fan-made guides.
Okay, so without further ado, what's my verdict? The combination of Minecraft and The Settlers (you can't directly control your units, only issue commands, and they'll execute them as they please—maybe it's more like Majesty?) is truly a unique game that deserves recognition for the possibilities it offers players. However, until a few major patches are released, improving even the introduction, it gets a strong seven! The developers have announced continued work on their work, so we can expect many patches, which would likely improve the rating – perhaps even by two points.

Pros
• Very extensive
• Nearly endless building options
Cons
• Awful tutorial
• Annoying music"

its pretty much like Gnomoria, but less complex. Workshops and else are very simple and crafting dull. Town building is hard due game mechanics but overall its all good.

7860880,german,2013.11.01 14:31,✅,✅,0.4764963388,10,"Towns ist eine nette kleine Abwechslung zum DungeonCrawling, das man sonst ja eher selber macht: Hier wird ähnlich wie bei anderen Spielen Dein Job verdreht, doch nicht dass man nun einen Dungeon ""keepen"" muss (Gruß an Bullfrog an dieser Stelle), sondern dass man die Stadt an der Oberfläche betreibt - bzw. erst mal aufbaut.
Startend auf der grünen Wiese mit nur ein paar Leuten heisst es pioniermäßig in die Hände zu spucken und eine Stadt inkl. der Verpflegungskette, Warenflüsse, Gebäude etc. pp. aufzubauen. Gerade die Verpflegung ist eine ständiges Problem und schon kleine Änderungen in der Versorgungskette kann katastrophale Folgen haben.
Anfangs wird man kleine Häuser, einfache Waffen und rüstungen herstellen, doch mit größerer Tiefe die die angelockten Helden erreichen kann man höherwertige Materialien finden und verarbeiten.
Aber Vorsicht: ab und an wird so ein Städtchen von Monster überfallen, ach und ebenso oft flüchten Helden in die Stadt, nur um eine Monstergruppe im Genick zu haben, die dann ja irgendwer killen muss ... Stadtwache?! STADTWACHE!!

Update nach einem Jahr:
Hunderte Stunden später muss ich wohl einsehen, dass ich Towns einfach mag: die Steuerung ist gewöhnungsbedürftig und Überleben mit allen Bewohnern ist anfangs eine Qual, später immernoch nicht sicher. Die kleinen Leute sind halt recht stumpf und erfüllen, was man ihnen aufträgt. Und wenn einer es nicht packt, macht sich der nächste auf den Weg. Oder jemand setzt ein Stück Dach und sperrt sich damit auf dem Dach weg ... dann merkt man erst an der sindenden Einwohnerzahl, das was falsch lief. Leider gibt es kein echtes Tutorial, was einem alles auf die Nase bindet. Trial and Error läßt einen Spieler anfangs gerne ein - zwei dutzende Male neu anfangen. Aber weiss man erstmal wie man die Mäuler mit Nahrung versorgt bekommt, kann man mehr und mehr auf Design der Gebäude/Stadt setzen. In meinem aktuellen Spiel habe ich die ersten 30 Stunden nur Stadt bauen lassen - keine Helden angelockt oder gar in den Boden gebudelt. Nur Unterkünfte und stabile Grundversorgung für 20 Leute. Und als die Vorräte immer größer wurden und die Leute gerne mal am Markt abhingen, da fing ich an eine Taverne zu bauen und hinab zu steigen, in den Dungeon.

Das Spiel ist unerbittlich bei Fehlern, wenig erklärend und bietet viele Möglichkeiten alles zu verlieren. Und der Verlauf ist LANGSAM. Ich denke, viele haben weder die Geduld, noch die Nerven für das Spiel, so wie es ist. Aber zu behaupten, es sei unfertig oder buggy, finde ich einfach falsch. Mit der richtigen Technik kann man alle Level im Untergrund erreichen, also entweder man lernt wie es geht oder sollte es sein lassen. Kein Spiel, wo einem ein Berater/Wizard alles vorkaut. Eher wie eines dieser kruden alten Spiele, wo man nie eine Anleitung für hatte, aber spürt, dass es großartig sein kann.","Towns is a nice little change from dungeon crawling, which you're usually more likely to do yourself: Here, similar to other games, your job is reversed, but instead of having to ""keep"" a dungeon (shoutout to Bullfrog here), you run the town on the surface – or rather, build it up first.
Starting on a greenfield site with just a few people, you have to get your hands dirty like a pioneer and build a town, including the supply chain, goods flows, buildings, etc. Supply, in particular, is a constant problem, and even small changes in the supply chain can have catastrophic consequences.
At first, you'll build small houses and simple weapons and armor, but as the heroes you attract go deeper, you'll be able to find and process higher-quality materials.
But be careful: every now and then, a small town like this gets attacked by monsters. Oh, and just as often, heroes flee into the city, only to have a group of monsters on their tail, which someone then has to kill... City Guard?! CITY GUARD!!

Update after a year:
Hundreds of hours later, I think I've come to the conclusion that I simply like Towns: the controls take some getting used to, and surviving with all the inhabitants is a pain at first, and later on, it's still not safe. The little people are pretty dull and do what you tell them. And if one doesn't manage it, the next one takes off. Or someone puts a piece of roof and locks themselves away on the roof... only then do you realize something went wrong when the population count drops. Unfortunately, there's no real tutorial to explain everything in your face. Trial and error often forces a player to start over a dozen or two dozen times. But once you know how to keep the mouths fed, you can focus more and more on building/city design. In my current game, I spent the first 30 hours building a town – not attracting heroes or even digging them into the ground. Just housing and a stable basic supply for 20 people. And as supplies grew and people started hanging out at the market, I started building a tavern and descending into the dungeon.

The game is relentless with errors, offers little explanation, and offers many opportunities to lose everything. And the progression is SLOW. I think many people have neither the patience nor the nerve for the game as it is. But to claim it's unfinished or buggy is simply wrong in my opinion. With the right technique, you can reach all the levels underground, so you either learn how to do it or you should leave it alone. It's not a game where an advisor/wizard tells you everything. More like one of those crude old games where you never had a manual, but you sense that it could be great."

Just Greenlight perhaps, but either way I won't be buying a game until it's fully released from now on, and I wish Steam would pull this game off the store and stop putting it on sale. It's a skeleton of a game and will never be more than that."

I've bought the game last year and it never changed since then (I played about 20 h in offline mode)
Unplayable as usual. They tried to modify some elements like the most wierd one... wheat crops.

To build your town you need to produce bread from wheat. At the release of the game on Steam dev simply forgot that when worlds are randomly generated you may be unable to find enough wheat crops...

They resolved it by being able to plant harvested wheat. Could they do that before ?!

Add to this the fact that feeding your population is a real burden and you got something real painfull ,uggly and controls are terrible.

TOWNS is not a good game and even not an average game !","This game is dead.

Before you buy, (who is looking to buy this game anymore??) be sure to check out various reviews and decide for yourself what you expect.  Yeah, there are bugs, the game is unfinished.  At launch, it was one of very few city building sims on Steam that had that element of RTS/Hero management.  

Banished for the same money is a near-AAA experience, so don't go buying this game unless you own that or Cities: Skylines.  If you are into resource and development sims then Factorio is infinitely a better choice.  There are others, but I'm only naming ones I have a lot of experience with.

Towns can be considered an early Java template game, it doesn't stray far from what you usually see in typical browser games, but I love it and that's that.  This game has a much better experience than Towncraft, an abandonware game that is way worse of a consumer-trust relationship.

Make sure you educate yourself if you're actually consider spending full price on this game.  There are hundreds of games on Steam that would probably be better suited for that amount.  If you want a unique glimpse into what was one of the ""founders"" of how Steam became the conglomerate of early access/scam gaming, you won't be disappointed.  And hey, once you get past the bugs and logic-defying mechanics, you might even enjoy playing it a little bit.

You build your own village using villagers, but as you build, hordes of monsters attack.
If there's no food in the village, all the villagers will starve to death. If you try to get wood or ore from the mountains or mines,
monsters will kill villagers and reduce their numbers...

The controls might be a little confusing the first time you play, but
as you wipe out villages over and over again...I'm sure you'll find a way to avoid wiping them out.

Why? This game really gave me some good time, cause i like the freedom in which you're able to build up a town, the retroish graphics and the possibility to alter the game due editing some xml files. Unfortunately the problems start right there: Since the engine limits the world to a 64*64 cube, you have to choose between dungeon roaming and building high up in the air, when altering the world generation (only a change in values). Last one is my favorite playstyle... or: would be, if the engine would not getting annoyingly laggy with more than 12 surface leves. There seem to be too many transparent blocks which affects the game as soon as you are giving more than two orders to your Townies. So, i am just not able to build high buildings without having a second lag, a second none, a second lag, a sec.. you get it. And that ""really grinds my gears"".

Also, the menu is crap and the tutorial basically only explains how to move your mouse from left to right and bottom to top. Furthermore, there are some serious bugs, which are a total pain in the a**. Check out the Community Hub's discussion to get an idea of them, it is a long list.
And yes, the devs spoofed those who bought this game, cause updates came in irregularily, were minor and the communication to us customers is worth mentioning.

At the moment rumors say the devs are looking for someone new to heritage this project. We´ll see.

After all Towns is a perfect example for everything which could go wrong with Steam's Greenlight/Early Access policy (or which mechanism else failed).

I recommend to keep this game in mind, check for updates and buy it when the shitstorm moves on.

On the one hand, it's a game with the interesting premise that you're creating a town to attract heroes to fight in the dungeons that are invariably discovered beneath the town.  On the other hand, it's bogged down by horrible micromanagement through clunky menus.  

Before you find yourself running a town worthy of adventurers coming to visit, you have to BUILD the town.  You start with a handful of people standing around with their thumbs up their asses waiting for you to tell them what to do.  You tell them to grab some fruit and put it over there in a patch of ground we'll call a stockpile.  You tell them to chop down trees and put the wood over there in a different stockpile.  You designate certain areas of ground as a room for various purposes and then have to figure out what order you're required to build the furniture for these rooms.

So you want beds for your people to sleep in?  You're gonna need a carpentry bench in a carpentry zone.  What about food more filling than apples and pears?  I guess you're gonna need a baking table and a baking oven in a baking zone.  But wait; there's something about this baking oven being made out of stone.  Now you're going to need a masonry room and an appropriate table in an appropriate zone.

This kind of crap takes place all the time in this game. Oh and it's also set to some mind numbing repetitive music barely above ""bad midi song"" level. The characters themselves aren't very well animated and most might as well be colored stick figures.  I mean, you tell your guys to chop down a tree...do you see them pull out an axe and swing it at the trunk?  No, you see them stand next to a tree for a few minutes while a chopping sound effect is played and then you're treated to your character hauling a log across the map to a stockpile (if you bothered to make one).

This game has a lot of promise and I've actually had this game since it was ""officially released"" waiting for it to live up to that promise.  It hasn't done it yet.  Oh and about that official release:  It basically went from alpha to final release overnight.  Had steam's ""Early Access"" been a thing at the time it would have been a perfect candidate for it.  Instead they released it as if it were done when just a day before it was ""alpha"" quality...but again, that wasn't really an option for them and they were desperate to make sales.  

Now, in the time since the game went ""live"" on steam to the writing of this review, they've put up a few updates and it does look like they've fixed a few things here and there, but it hasn't changed to the point where I could wholeheartedly say ""yes, buy this game!""  It's still got a rough and unfinished feel to it, and if they'd take some time to polish up the UI, add some more variety to the music, and redo most of the graphics, it would at least look like they've made some progress.  Instead it's all ""under the hood"" stuff with very little outward change from the earliest version on Steam.

If despite all of this you're still willing to buy the game, yes, you can easily sink 10-20 hours into it (I've almost sunk 20 into it when it was in its most broken state) because you get that feeling that somehow you're slowly making progress in the game and building something.

I understood this to mean that I was buying into an alpha that was in development still. The game feels about 40% complete. It's playable, but..

1. The AI is terrible. Both townie and mob. 
2. The way you construct things is really hard to use, reminescent of RCT2 in that the isometric way the roofs tile makes it difficult for you to see if you placed a roof properly or not, but with the added annoyance that you need to have it so that your townies can reach it, so you need to place scaffolds everywhere. It's not fun, it feels like a chore.
3. The GUI seriously leaves a lot to be desired. Things with no tooltip, weird buttons that do unclear things, annoying flashing notification buttons every single time you pause/unpause..
4. Complete(or near complete) lack of satisfactory tutorials. It's not extremely hard to grasp like DF is, but there are strange things that I still don't understand, like why the entire underground of the map appears to be a giant dungeon and there is no underground stone. 
5. Bugs.
6. No where near as much customization is possible as DF has, the environment is basically the same generic map each time.

All of these things are totally fixable. The problem? The devs have halted development. There hasn't been a patch in several months, no offical posts on the (horrible, echo chamber of a) forum, total silence.

Don't buy this broken, unfinished mess. Truly a disappointment.","Broken, buggy, unfinished mess. This game was released on Greenlight, with the devs claiming that they would continue development. I understood this to mean that I was buying into an alpha that was in development still. The game feels about 40% complete. It's playable, but..

1. The AI is terrible. Both townie and mob. 
2. The way you construct things is really hard to use, reminescent of RCT2 in that the isometric way the roofs tile makes it difficult for you to see if you placed a roof properly or not, but with the added annoyance that you need to have it so that your townies can reach it, so you need to place scaffolds everywhere. It's not fun, it feels like a chore.
3. The GUI seriously leaves a lot to be desired. Things with no tooltip, weird buttons that do unclear things, annoying flashing notification buttons every single time you pause/unpause..

The store page also says that it will be continuously updated, but this does not happen. We get a patch all few months, which tends to break even more things.

There was barely a tutorial involved, so I had no idea what I was doing.

A rather cute sandbox game set in medieval time. 
The graphics is really nice retro. It is in a 45 degree turned isomettric view. This is also the low-point of it, it can't be turned that I know of. The menues are in the tiniest format, it's as easy to delete a game as it it to load it. That said, the menues inside the game are much better. Which is where the main production value seems to have been spent.
The sound is very nice, slightly reminiscent of Settlers, the very first game, in the mood at least. I wouldn't say it's intrusive but you won't remember it either, which to me is a good point for game music.
The actual game is fairly straight up management with the added fun of actual being able to lose quickly. The learning curve is steep, not overly but it will take a few games to get it like you want it. The management increases over time as you gain more people living in your town.
You are very much victim of circumstances with this game. Sometimes you find iron at the surface, sometimes there is none to save your life. The caravans are an offset but dreaming of gold statues after a few hours, you've really struck gold. This makes every game a new challenge which is nice. Pretty much as Civilization was.

The main thing to say about this game is that it's a time thief. You constantly look for the next thing you'll 'just do before quitting'. It sort of reminds you of minecraft in that aspect.","Update: Abandoned now. It is what it is. Not exactly broken but neither finished as such. There are other games instead. Sorry.

Потом еще минут... часа 3-10 :) на то чтобы, после 20 перезапусков игры по новой, наконец построить хотя бы одно здание и при этом жители не попередохли от окружающей флоры и фауны :)
А дальше можно ""расслабиться"" и отбивая осады, организуя питание, добычу полезных ископаемых, складирование всего добытого хлама, развивая инфраструктуру, начать потихоньку углубляться вглубь недр :)
Отгребая в процессе погружения от монстряков, хороня героев пачками, собирая трупы своих геройских жителей решивших забрать что-то в другом конце подземелья и умерших с голоду по дороге назад :)

You spend about 15 minutes learning the menus.
You spend about 60 minutes figuring out how the hell it all works. Then another 3-10 minutes... an hour or so :) until, after 20 restarts, you finally build at least one building without your residents dying from the surrounding flora and fauna. :)
And then you can ""relax"" and, fending off sieges, organizing food supplies, mining, storing all the scrap you've collected, developing infrastructure, slowly begin to delve deeper into the depths. :)
Defending monsters as you dive, burying heroes in droves, collecting the corpses of your heroic residents who decided to take something from the other end of the dungeon and died of starvation on the way back. :)

With a bit of hardwork you can make your villagers clear out the dungeons as well, but they are better suited to keeping the heros happy. I believe this game is still under construction but it has the potential to be a great game and as far as im concerned it already is. Id give it a 4/5 simply because it needs a little polishing."

Construction is incredibly poor, mineral types are minimal, and the overall goal is rather simple: clear all 10 (I think) lower floors. On the plus side, it's easy to learn, has a decent bestiary, and offers a wide variety of activities (with a strong focus on food preparation for now). Now, there's also the added feature of city continuity and unique equipment obtained by other players online. I picked it up a year ago (version .42b), thinking the developers would abandon it, especially since Gnomoria and Timber and Stone have already released decent alternatives.

Below is my original review when things were still being worked on and the game was mostly stable.


In this game, you create and build a town that caters to dungeon-delving heroes.  That dungeon just happens to be BELOW your town and goes very deep into the ground.    Think: SimCity meets Minecraft for a basic idea of the game.  I have mixed feelings about this game.  It has plenty of micromanagement, resource acquisition and goods production but you can't directly control your civilians, soldiers or any of the heroes.  It can be very frustrating when your civilians are starving to death about 12 levels below ground while they were trying to collect raw materials, such as copper or silver, that another civilian mined.  It can also be frustrating when your town of 10 people becomes a town of 0 people when monsters from the depths over-run your populace because you inadvertantly mined a pathway for the monsters to come to the surface.  The game has a good concept and is fun to play but it is missing a big part of the equation which could make this a great game.  The potential I discovered by playing the free demo was what prompted me to buy the game.  It's worth trying the demo if you are into stragety/management games, you get 20 in-game days of playtime, just be sure to put the game on the slowest speed so you aren't overwhelmed in minutes.","The developer has stopped work on this game and it is currently buggy and unstable.

It can be very frustrating when your civilians are starving to death about 12 levels below ground while they were trying to collect raw materials, such as copper or silver, that another civilian mined.  It can also be frustrating when your town of 10 people becomes a town of 0 people when monsters from the depths over-run your populace because you inadvertantly mined a pathway for the monsters to come to the surface.  The game has a good concept and is fun to play but it is missing a big part of the equation which could make this a great game.  The potential I discovered by playing the free demo was what prompted me to buy the game.  It's worth trying the demo if you are into stragety/management games, you get 20 in-game days of playtime, just be sure to put the game on the slowest speed so you aren't overwhelmed in minutes."

The tutorials can be done in 5 seconds where it seems pointless to do them and the tutorials don't cover enough. Some pre made towns would be awesome. A news ticker would be great. A lot of this game is tranquil waiting. You send your townies to do something and it starts off being quick, but as the town gets bigger it can take them hours to build a set of small homes. Its a game you can watch TV and come back to while it plays.

well towns is a beta alpha (when i wrote this)  it is very muchly buggy and glitchy and annoying at times but so was minecraft back in its baby years (least as i heard and not alot to do i figure this be like minecraft buggy glitchy and get fixed as it goes and may raise in price!)

now its not a bad game imo worth the 10-20 dollars (us) 

it alsohas alot of mods to make it more interesting kinda like minecraft only you dont controll the players and there kinda stupid at times do not get this game if your looking for an alternative minecraft get terraria its closest i found! but  this game is a  fun build type game my advice try demo first to see if this be what you want do tutorial and a map its 20 in game day demo!!

its fun but very challenging and i mean very cause the ai doesnt always make the propper link to make food so you will end up having your peoples starve to death ALOT (grain->flour->bread they dont do this less there hungery! and no fruits)

now my advice is take all the tutorials then! start the normal map (easiest to do imo)
then look for 1 thing on the map away from the jungle
iron (it b a orange colouring on the map)
find iron! so you can make a anvile and a smelter and a stove (also butcher and kitchen table but iron not needed for these and a cow and pig farm advice best meat in game)
with those items you can cook all the meat you want and spare a 2x2 iron least one more be better for a mine shaft (2x2= 2 by 2 dont know what thsi means its simple 2 above and 2 below 2 by 2)
then once you got your stove(s) {i have 4 of almost all utilitys} going adventure out find coal for your mining shafts to automatically get free iron with out destroying it wonderful! 
then find a 2x2 coal and put a shaft on it! prob best to do it first then a iron then a coal then the other irons
then after this point when you get ALOT of extra food so much you ready 2 toss alot out... make your tavern for heros to come by and oh make sure if  you make a ladder down to the dungeon to wall the entrance off in some way to prevent monsters

duly note this you WILL restart alot of times even if you dont hunt for irons i find it very diffcult at first but when you get used to the game its easy and to regain villagers let them idle around makes them happy! and ahve spare personal zones beds and stuff

其餘介紹與攻略請見個人BLOG：http://loni6912.blogspot.com","Towns is a business simulation game. In a desolate landscape, you lead settlers (townspeople) to build homes, farm and raise livestock, mine, forge, raise armies to protect them, and recruit heroes to explore dungeons. Fans of The Settlers or Dwarf Fortress will likely enjoy this game. Towns is based on the concept of Dwarf Fortress (a similar game to Dwarf Fortress is Gnomoria, a graphical game based on Dwarf Fortress that's closer to Dwarf Fortress than Towns). However, Towns is more graphically simplistic (compared to Dwarf Fortress). Unlike The Settlers, which focuses on military strategy, Towns emphasizes town management and dungeon exploration (in a sense, it's a different kind of RPG). I was initially drawn to the town management aspect of The Settlers, but I've become a little dissatisfied and disappointed with its shift towards strategy. Fortunately, games like Dwarf Fortress still exist.

Połączenie pierwszych SimCity i MInecraft , mam nadzieję że twórcy będą ciągle ją rozbudowywać bo gra ma wielki potencjał. Dobra kończe pisać moją mała recenzję, bo muszę rozbudować szpital...","At first, I liked the premise: ""Don't run your hero through dungeons, instead, take care of their needs by building a city at the dungeon entrance!"" - AWESOME!! Almost like the reverse of Dungeon Keeper? I buy it on sale, install it, and launch it - WHAT A SHIT!! Clunky interface, indie graphics, but with a very small ""i."" I click and click through tutorials. A bit off, the descriptions of what, where, and how to do things could be improved. I launch my first standalone game. I play, I get beaten, people starve, layers skip. Nothing is playable!
The next day - I'll give it another try. I launch it, I play, I understand, I get used to it. I turn it off after a few hours of uninterrupted gameplay - I'm in love with this game. A mix of the first SimCity and Minecraft. I hope the developers will keep expanding it because the game has great potential. Okay, I'm finishing writing my little review because I have to expand the hospital..."

Old Review:

This game builds upon the sandbox/terraforming games, yet brings about something new. 

It is rather slow paced when it comes to doing everything, but that works well with it. Although it isn't a complete game, the developer is continuing to add to and improve it.

Very high recommendation!!","Update:

　まあしかし真面目に遊ぶならwikiとか動画を探して見るんだ。それが最も手っ取り早いだろう。","The survival game-like opening is incredibly amazing, reminiscent of a city-building game. The first few hours are crap. That's almost certainly true. So don't count on negative reviews from players with less than five hours of playtime. This game's biggest enemy is the tutorial, which is incredibly confusing and demotivating. But you won't understand the game unless you complete the bare minimum. And it doesn't teach you everything. It's the bare minimum. You'll probably have to restart countless times. Villagers starve to death, get killed by monsters, and sometimes the first tree you try to cut down is attacked by a monster, killing several people and forcing you to reset. And if you don't know anything, your population never increases. The tutorial doesn't teach you how to increase the population. What a fucking, unreasonable, shitty game. But it has a mysterious charm that overflows with it. It's there, absolutely. If you're hesitating to buy it, even if it doesn't suit you, I want you to enjoy it, knowing that you'll regret it and laugh, saying, ""What a crappy game!"" Then it gets fun. Seriously. But if you're serious about playing, look up a wiki or watch videos. That would be the quickest way."

Amazingly this went from being a misleading game using faked screenshots to outright game abandonment and cashgrabbing. Devs never finished the game, sold as much as they could and then ran.

Stay away. Far away.
 
**** original review below***

A very early Alpha of a basic Dwaf Fortress clone. Developers are clearly making a cash grab with the early sale. This is fine if you are ok ""Kickstarting"" the game devs but they don't mention the state of this turd at all on the game's page. Further the screenshots on that page? Complete and total falsehoods. Check back in a few months and see if the devs are still releasing updates or if they just take the cash and run. Also, the game forums are full of major league douches. Caveat emptor.","Update:

Start from pretty much nothing, command your people to harvest wood, gather apples, grow wheat and afterwards bake a bread out of it. Crafting is as necessary part of this game as it is in Minecraft. In addition to this, you should really take it as a serious matter to equip swords and armor to some of your townsfolk, because if you face a vicious tree, a ghost, a spider or anything between them, you're pretty much dead. By setting your military men to patrol around your village when building it towards to the greatest empire on earth, you should feel pretty safe!

Imagine Kairosoft's Dungeon Village had an affair with Terraria, which resulted in the spawn of this isometric wonderland of hardcore strategy and micromanaged world-building. If Towns ever goes multiplayer, it will change how we view multiplayer world-builders like Minecraft.

The only downside to this game is that it's java and thus runs in JRE. Here I thought Minecraft was an example of why you SHOULDN'T make your 3D game entirely in Java, but this lesson was clearly not taken to heart by Canal and Palgi. 7/10.","Not the most original of concepts, but definitely a fantastic implementation.

Not worth the price right now, but if they made some strong changes to the polish then it would be TOTALLY worth it.","I played this thinking it was like dungeon village, it does have some elements but this is kinda like an Isometric Minecraft. With villagers.
