### Project Plan

For this project I will be looking at a number of video game reviews from all nine different review ranks utilized by the application Steam. These ranks exist on a scale from *overwhelmingly positive* to *overwhelmingly negative* with *mixed* as the center point. 

These reviews are written and submitted by players of the games and can additionally be voted on by others as "helpful" or "funny". Game reviews posted by players can only be positive or negative. 

The first half of the project is intended to be an analysis of the content and language used in English reviews of the games I've chosen. What are common words and phrases that appear in different reviews? Is there any indication of genre that can be inferred from the language used? Is there any correlation in word count, word length, or word variety (TTR) and a review's type (positive or negative)? 

Second, I want to construct a classifier. By measuring the language used in the reviews, my classifier should be able to reliably predict whether a novel review is a positive recommendation or a negative condemnation. If possible, I would like to construct a more complex classifier as well. With the full game review data, test if a classifier can predict the game's current (recorded as of the time of downloading the data) Steam ranking - at least between positive, negative, and mixed.
