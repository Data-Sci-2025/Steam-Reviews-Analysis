This game could be good if you give some TLC . It definitely needs a story a plot and a main villain .

Вот только сюжет в ней отсутствует (а это абсолютно непростительно для жрпг), геймплей не проработан, баланс отсутствует как таковой, что делать куда идти - непонятно. Брать не советую даже по скидке. У игры и так было всего 14% положительных отзывов, теперь будет ещё меньше в процентном соотношении","I love the RPG Maker series of engines; I'm currently making my first game with it. This game, so to speak, was made with it. However, it lacks a story (which is absolutely unforgivable for a JRPG), the gameplay is poorly developed, the balance is nonexistent, and it's unclear what to do or where to go. I wouldn't recommend picking it up, even on sale. The game already had only 14% positive reviews, and now it'll be even lower."

DLC받으면 19금이 된다고 해서 690원주고 샀는데 돈 아까워 미치겠음.

처음 게임 시작할 때 나오는 메인메뉴 여자만 옷 벗어서 꼭1지 보여주고, 보1지는 살로 덮혀있음.
그거 외에는 달라지는게 전혀 없더라.

그리고 게임성도 개판임.
내가 이거 게임 시작하니까 아무런 설명없이 그냥 맵 한가운데 던져둠....
뭔가 말을 거는것도 없고 그냥 던져놓고 끝.

덕분에 내가 여기저기 돌아다니다가 이게 조옷망 게임인걸 판단하고 게임을 종료하고, 게임을 분해해서 확인해봤더니
야한거 없더라. 위에 적은 그 CG 1장이 끝임.


[h1]절대 사지마라. 사기당한건 나 하나면 족하다.[/h1]

","Don't buy it even if you're a 18+ user.
I paid 690 won for it because they said the DLC would make it rated R, but I'm going crazy over the waste of money.

On the main menu screen when you first start the game, only the girl takes off her clothes and shows off her pussy, and her pussy is covered in flesh.
Aside from that, nothing else changes.

And the gameplay is a mess.
I started playing it, and they just threw it in the middle of the map without any explanation...

They didn't even talk to me, they just threw it there and that's it.

Thanks to that, I wandered around and realized this was a rip-off game. I quit the game, took it apart, and found
nothing sexually explicit. The one CG I mentioned above is all there is to it.

[h1]Never buy this. I'm the only one who got scammed.[/h1]

6块简直太贵了，不值得","This is utterly rubbish, a title that's all for show.
Everything in it is flawed: I start with low health, and I thought that was it, until I put in some effort to kill monsters and buy potions, only to find myself at low health when the scene refreshes. Low health lock? Okay, I'll just fight through it. It's fine for a couple of times, but the third time, I'm completely out of potions?! Yeah, even if you buy a lot, they're gone and invisible, and it's low health lock again. The same goes for NPCs. They disappear permanently after one conversation. The translation says they're quests, but the game system doesn't even have a quest list. Some are merchants or shops, which is fine. Some treasure chests are inaccessible (bottom right corner of town). The maps are buggy. The large map is good without mines, just a rough draft, except for the boat. The town map is buggy, with monster nests in every house, and you're dead when you're locked in at low health.
This game is a crappy product. It's really a gimmicky map at the start, and you still have the nerve to ask for a price?! Free rants from everyone!!!!!!! ! !

[h1] Gameplay [/h1] Wir können uns aussuchen ob wir einen Männlichen oder Weiblichen Charakter spielen wollen. Es macht keinen Großen Unterschied denn man startet mit 1 HP. Man kann sich (wenn man das Mädel spielt) via Heil Zauber heilen aber wenn man aus dem Menü rausgeht hat man automatisch wieder nur 1 HP. Potions kann man kaufen aber auch diese heilen nicht. Heisst man spielt dauerhaft mit einem HP. Zudem ist das Spiel kaum Übersetzt heisst die meisten Texte sind auf Russisch. Wenn man Häuser betritt startet automatisch ein Zufallskampf den man logischerweise sofort verliert. Selbst in den Screenshots des Spiels sieht man das der Charakter immer nur 1 HP hat. Musik gibt es außerhalb von Kämpfen auch keine. NPCs & Kisten verschwinden einfach so und man hat auch keine Start Waffe

[h1] Pro/Contra [/h1]
+ XBox 360 Controller Support

- Leider Keine Achievements
- Man startet mit 1 HP und heilen hat keine Wirkung (sobald man aus dem Menü rausgeht hat man wieder nur 1 HP)
- Sehr schlecht Übersetzt (Sehr viele Texte auf Russisch)
- Betritt man Häuser kommt sofort ein Zufallskampf den man natürlich aufgrund der Mangelnden HP sofort verliert
- Es gibt Keine Musik außerhalb von Kämpfen
- NPCs verschwinden nach dem Ansprechen
- Man hat Keine Waffe

[h1] Fazit [/h1] Eine unglaubliche Frechheit für sowas hier Geld zu verlangen. Das Spiel ist überhaupt nicht fertig. Man könnte das Spiel mit Patches in Ordnung bringen aber offensichtlich besteht wohl darin kein Interesse. Definitiv Nicht zu Empfehlen


👑 Powered by HoI 4 Deu  Kuratorengruppe auf deutsch/englisch 👑⠀⠀⠀🎉 [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/30388691/] Folgen [/url]","[h1] Genre [/h1] A JRPG

[h1] Gameplay [/h1] We can choose whether we want to play a male or female character. It doesn't make much difference, as you start with 1 HP. You can heal yourself (if you're playing the female character) with healing spells, but when you exit the menu, you automatically have only 1 HP again. Potions can be purchased, but they don't heal. This means you play with one HP permanently. Furthermore, the game is barely translated, meaning most of the text is in Russian. When you enter houses, a random battle automatically starts, which you, logically, lose immediately. Even in the game screenshots, you can see that the character always only has 1 HP. There's no music outside of battles either. NPCs and crates simply disappear, and you don't have a starting weapon.

[h1] Pros/Cons [/h1]
+ Xbox 360 Controller Support

- Unfortunately, no achievements
- You start with 1 HP and healing has no effect (as soon as you exit the menu, you only have 1 HP again)
- Very poorly translated (a lot of text is in Russian)
- When you enter houses, a random battle immediately starts, which you immediately lose due to your lack of HP.
- There's no music outside of battles.
- NPCs disappear after being spoken to.
- You don't have a weapon.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1] It's incredibly impudent to charge for something like this. The game isn't finished at all. They could fix it with patches, but apparently there's no interest in doing so. Definitely Not Recommended

- NPCs won't repeat their dialogues and some may even disappear forever after talking to them, which makes a challenge to your memory abilities
- Upon entering homes you'll be facing an enemy while you're at 1 HP, to prove your survival skills
- World maps have at most one other area to explore, once you find it after going around it for like 30 minutes you'll feel a sense of accomplishment
- Some texts are written in broken English and even some others remain untranslated to give out that natural foreign world language experience
- Despite the title stating that the girl has a big SWORD she starts out with none, being this a metaphor that the sword was the adventures we lived through the game.

Только в 1 доме полезли нескончаемые орки, как тараканы. Я их била около получаса, прокачалась до 25 уровня, а они не кончаются. Надоело и я выключила игру, теперь буду играть с последнего сохранения.  Может кто знает, что это за бесконечные орки? Так поиграть можно, но если опять бить нескончаемых орков(кнопка побег не работает), то ну ее на фиг. И еще то-ли это баг со вторым демоном на остовах, я не поняла. Я нашла дверь в пустыне, взяла сундук, а этот голубенький сундучок тут-же исчез, хотя у меня 10 отмычек и 1 ключ. Далее у меня в предметах ( именно в предметах, где все зелья) был пистолет, я на него нажала, и он исчез. Что все это значит, непонятно. Что отдавать 2-му демону тоже.  Кто разобрался, отпишитесь в комментариях.После патча решила еще сыгрануть. Орки убрались, все остальное осталось. Найденный пистолет, он дает + 250 атаки, одеть нельзя. Пришлось его продать дешевле, чтобы его-же и купить, но дороже и только тогда можно одеть. Теперь и с первым демоном проблема, меч пропал вместе с сундуком. До патча этот квест сдавался. Описания что какой-либо предмет дает герою нет. И очень много недоделок. Самое смешное, что девочка с большим мечом, изначально вообще без оружия. Это не игра, а баг на баге. Хотела дать игре шанс, но этого больного спасти нельзя. Меняю обзор на отрицательный.","No one dies in the game. At the start of the battle, press healing magic, restore health, and defeat everyone. It's impossible to die. Only in one house did endless orcs start crawling around like cockroaches. I spent about half an hour fighting them, leveled up to level 25, and they still wouldn't end. I got tired of it and turned the game off; now I'll play from the last save. Does anyone know what these endless orcs are? It's playable, but if you keep fighting endless orcs (the escape button doesn't work), then screw it. Also, maybe it's a bug with the second demon on the wrecks, I don't understand. I found a door in the desert, picked up a chest, and the little blue chest immediately disappeared, even though I had 10 lockpicks and 1 key. Then, in my inventory (specifically, in the inventory where all the potions are), I had a pistol; I clicked on it, and it disappeared. I don't understand what all this means. What to give to the second demon, too. If anyone figured it out, please post in the comments. After the patch, I decided to play again. The orcs were gone, but everything else remained. I found a pistol, it gives +250 attack, but it can't be equipped. I had to sell it for less so I could buy the same one, but at a higher price, and only then can I equip it. Now I'm having trouble with the first demon too: the sword disappeared along with the chest. This quest was completed before the patch. There's no description of what the hero gains from any item. And there are a lot of flaws. The funniest thing is that the girl with the big sword initially has no weapon at all. This isn't a game, it's a bug after a bug.
