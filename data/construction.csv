204227405,english,2025.08.13 14:42,❌,✅,0.5170454383,1,"Construction Machines 2014, developed and published by GameCask, is a simulation game that attempts to immerse players in the world of construction through the operation of heavy machinery. Released on March 28, 2014, the game offers a variety of construction tasks, including demolishing old houses, flattening the ground, filling foundations with concrete, and building new structures. Players take on the role of a construction company boss, managing contracts and expanding their business by operating different types of construction machines, such as trucks, diggers, and cranes.

Despite its ambitious premise, Construction Machines 2014 has received overwhelmingly negative feedback from the gaming community. With a ""Very Negative"" rating on Steam, based on over 230 user reviews, the game has been criticized for its numerous technical issues and lackluster gameplay. Players have reported frustrating controls, poor camera angles, unoptimized performance, and unrealistic physics, all of which contribute to a disjointed and unenjoyable experience. Many users have also pointed out that the game's graphics are subpar, often resembling outdated technology, which further detracts from the immersion.

One of the most significant criticisms of the game is its lack of realism. Players have noted that the game does not accurately represent construction machinery operations, with unrealistic physics and controls that do not mimic real-life equipment handling. This lack of authenticity makes it difficult for players to engage with the game meaningfully, especially those with prior knowledge or interest in construction machinery.

In terms of gameplay, Construction Machines 2014 offers 20 contracts to fulfill, along with additional challenges and a free play mode. However, the missions are often described as repetitive and unenjoyable, contributing to an overall negative experience. The game's controls have been a particular point of contention, with many players finding them frustrating and unresponsive, making gameplay difficult and unenjoyable. Additionally, the camera angles have been highlighted as a significant issue, further contributing to a frustrating gaming experience.

The game's performance has also been a major concern. Players have mentioned that the game suffers from poor optimization, leading to low frame rates and crashes. These technical issues make it challenging to enjoy the game, as players are often interrupted by performance-related problems.

In conclusion, Construction Machines 2014 fails to deliver on its promise of providing an authentic and engaging construction simulation experience. With its numerous technical issues, lack of realism, and unpolished gameplay, the game falls short of expectations. While it may appeal to players with a strong interest in construction machinery, the game's shortcomings make it difficult to recommend to a broader audience. For those seeking a more refined and realistic construction simulation, it would be advisable to explore other titles in the genre.

CM14 is amazingly bad, it ticks off all the boxes of how not to do a simulator.

CM14 is loaded full of bugs. I was able to complete 3 of the 11 included contracts, the fourth unlocks but is missing the excavator needed to unload crates from the cargo truck. While you can technically unload the truck by reversing into a cement fountain and knocking them out of the cargo bay, this does not count towards level completion. Game audio does not function due to the game randomly flipping through included tracks so fast they don't have time to play. Profiles can delete themselves once created as well as after finishing a couple contracts.

I highly recommend skipping CM14, there's a reason PlayWay is still offering a free (similarly aged) game as an apology for this thing if you email them proof of purchase.","How PlayWay managed to survive, let alone thrive, after this abysmal release is beyond me.

Ich hab mich so auf dieses Game gefreut. Die zahlreichen Negativ-Reviews, die häßlichen Screenshots, alles sprach dafür, wieder mal so eine richtige Gurke vor sich zu haben, bei der gar nichts funktioniert.

Und was soll ich sagen: es funktioniert wirklich gar nichts. Allerdings nicht so wie ich es erhofft hatte. Das Spiel startet nicht. Trotz zahlreicher Versuche auf unterschiedlichste Weise und auf zwei unterschiedlichen Rechnern, es startet einfach nicht.

Schade, schade. Ich hätte meinen Verriss gerne auf inhaltliche Schwächen, auf grottiges Gameplay und furchbares Design bezogen, so kann ich ihn denn doch nur auf ein anscheinend kaputtes Programm beziehen, das zumindest auf meinen Rechner einfach nicht läuft.

I was so excited for this game. The numerous negative reviews, the ugly screenshots, everything suggested that I was dealing with another complete dud where nothing works.

And what can I say: absolutely nothing works. Not the way I had hoped, though. The game won't start. Despite numerous attempts in various ways and on two different computers, it simply won't start.

What a pity. I would have liked to have focused my criticism on weaknesses in the content, terrible gameplay, and terrible design, but I can only focus it on an apparently broken program that simply won't run, at least on my computer.

Also, von dem wackelnden Menu kann einem schlecht werden (meine Frau wollte schon fragen, ob die Antenne kaputt ist), Benutzername und Computername im Spielerprofil vorzuschlagen find ich einfach ätzend, und keine Einstellungen für die Auflösung zu haben ist auch schwach.

Aber die erste Mission dann ist ein Brecher!

Die Kamera ist eine Strafe!
1st Person: im Bulldozer sitzend schaut man auf die Schaufel, also wenn die Schaufel auf dem Boden aufliegt, was sie ja sollte wenn man was wegschieben will, kann man nicht so wirklich sehen wo man hinfährt.
Freie Kamera: die ist mal so garnicht frei sondern zuckelt sich was wie sie will, wenn man wegzoomt und dann kippen will, zoom sie zuckelnd wieder ran. Zusätzlich guckt sie ständig zum Fahrzeug hin.
3rd Person: folgt nicht vernünftig sondern bleibt irgendwie im Raum hängen, man fährt also drunter durch beim zurückstoßen, und sieht dann nicht mehr wo man hin will wenn man wieder vorwärts will.

und dann soll man Trümmer in ein Loch schieben... nach der dritten Ladung hing der Lader mit drin.

Nein, also, einfach lächerlich. echt M.I.S.T.

zum glück nur -,59 bezahlt im Sale, das war mir der Lacher wert - und die Erfahrung ""wie man es nicht machen sollte"".
also, wer mal wieder lachend OMG brüllen will, bis zum nächsten Sale warten und zuschlagen.
Vollpreisig: Nein, eine Beleidigung.","LOL! That's the biggest crap ever! xD

Well, the wobbly menu is sickening (my wife was about to ask if the antenna was broken), suggesting usernames and computer names in the player profile is just annoying, and not having any resolution settings is also weak.

But the first mission is a real pain!

The camera is a punishment!
1st person: Sitting in the bulldozer, you look at the shovel. So, if the shovel is touching the ground, which it should be if you're trying to push something away, you can't really see where you're going.
Free camera: It's not free at all, but rather jerks around as it pleases. If you zoom out and then try to tilt, it jerks back in. Additionally, it constantly looks at the vehicle.
3rd Person: doesn't follow properly but somehow gets stuck in space, so you drive under it when you push back, and then you can't see where you're going when you want to go forward again.

And then you're supposed to push debris into a hole... after the third load, the loader was stuck in it.

No, well, just ridiculous. Really CRAP.

Luckily, I only paid -0.59 during the sale, which was worth the laugh for me - and the experience of ""how not to do it.""
So, if you want to laugh and shout ""OMG"" again, wait until the next sale and grab it.
Full price: No, that's an insult."

Frame rate is ok; just need to adjust settings in the launcher to suit your system capability. I can get more than 60 fps if various options are set to very low on my potato PC notebook.

[b]Update - 2nd job[/b]

While the first job is easy depending on how you want to play it 'coz you can just push everything into the pit, no need to carry them in the bucket. The 2nd job is needlessly difficult. For one thing, you're supposed to load bricks onto the truck. That is fine and good BUT the bricks are scattered all over the place, not in piles as you may expect but in single pieces. 

[u]Simulation detail level[/u]
To exacerbate the task, the boom arm motion is jerky and the vehicle motion is also jerky in that it has ridiculously quick acceleration. Initially, the quick acceleration was fun in the first job but not in the this one as it makes moving the bricks frustrating 'coz it tends to bounce and fall off. Incidentally it's very difficult to scoop and carry more than one brick at a time as said before the bricks tend to fall off. Even though some bouncy motion is probably normal for Wheel Loaders, it seems excessive in this simulator; there isn't enough damping IMO but this may be due to my choice of physics realism. I will try again with the most realistic option and update this review if there is improvement.

Watch a real Wheel Loader at work and see if you agree: https://youtu.be/bKXIO4HMd-M

[u]Flawed mission design[/u]
So if we are going to struggle to load one brick at a time, what's the point of using a heavy lifter? A human being could do a far better and quicker job; just throw the bricks onto the truck! Anyway i'm gonna try to finish this job 'coz i hate myself. No really i just want to see what's up next and next and so on.

[u]Graphics[/u]
The 2nd job shows the range of atmospheric and time effects. It takes place in dark rainy conditions. The ground is wet, shiny and slippery so it isn't just eye candy, there are physical effects on vehicle handling.

[u]Career Progression[/u]
There's continuity and a persistent world in that the construction yard is in the same mess as you left it before in the previous job so that's an interesting twist of small strategic element. Your previous vehicle remain the same color and you can choose a different color for your next vehicle. I presume that in advanced stages you could either have color coded fleet or uniformity for your fleet. 

[u]Avatar function[/u]
The avatar doesn't seem to have any useful function to manipulate objects so that the mess you made can be rectified and re-arranged neatly or to kick objects into the pit. Even if you could kick or bump objects around, its awkward movement and control makes it impractical. It's only purpose seem to be to personalise the career mode. Perhaps it can be used to corral the bricks into sizable heaps so that the Wheel Loader can pick it up more easily. 

Incidentally the avatar's jumping motion isn't smooth nor believable but it's funny and it has some semblance of MJ style of moonwalking when walking backwards. No side-stepping in 3rd person view.

[u]...Third update (regarding the Flawed mission)[/u]
My bad, the bricks are larger than the common red bricks found on non-loadbearing brickwalls; it's too heavy for a man to lift. I tried kicking it... wouldn't budge so we are back to scouring the ground for scattered bricks. Therefore it's still a flawed mission IMO.

[u]... 4th update (Flawed mission - not really)[/u]
Ok so i was a bit hasty with preconceived notions that it would be too difficult or tedious. Reason is twofold. First it wasn't so hard once realistic physics is applied and you take advantage of a bit forward momentum when scooping bricks. 2nd reason is that you needn't collect all the bricks lying on the ground and enough bricks are around to practice scooping techniques.
...End of 4th update.

[b]End of update (about 2nd job)[/b]


[b]Summation[/b]
Bought this in PlayWay Sim bundle so it's a good deal. Haven't seen any game breaking bug. Of course it's a little too early to tell as i have not completed the game yet. Most of the time was spent trying to find the right settings for my notebook PC.

Only 1 minor bug encountered in the beginning during the short tutorial; the mouselook was inverted when on foot in first person perspective. External vehicle view has no problem rotating the right way. Had to delete profile and recreate a new one for the problem to disappear. I hope it doesn't recur later in the Career,

So far no regrets buying at this low price, Worth it i think. You can even customize your own music playlist but it has to be in ogg format. So if you want to squeeze a bit more performance, you can use a lower bit rate for the music files.

Despite its quirkiness, it's a fun game with refreshing and upbeat music, the likes of which was heard in Capitalism Plus. Its clunky handling can be mitigated somewhat by careful use of movement keys and bucket loads of patience.

Score? hmm maybe 6.5/10... revised to 7.5/10 after completing job #2.

We get into a tractor—our first vehicle—to clear the area, and we essentially can't see anything because we can't look around from the vehicle. Once we're seated, we're stuck staring at one spot, which hurts everything...

I didn't shake like that when I learned about my grandfathers fighting in the war, and they made a bad meme about them (I'm a moralist). It's crap.

Neither Tarkovsky nor Wim Wenders could have dreamed of such a thing. Everything here is like a real construction site (I say this as someone in the know): everything is haphazard, there's no plan, it's done haphazardly, and you're left with no consequences. We're given a task, and we're thrown into a sandbox to solve it. But the physics in the game decide. The car rolls down a slope, and the camera is always attached not to the car, but to the car's gun! But realism... ten control buttons—and that's not the end! I barely got to the missions where you have to destroy buildings. Not quite what I expected, of course... but it was truly difficult, guys!

Немного не то, чего я ожидал, конечно... но это было поистине трудно, ребята! Перед тем как снова идти на стройку, я теперь всегда играю полчаса в эту игру. Я советую в неё поиграть, но покупать не советую!","At first, I was really hooked, but after an hour, it became painful. A harsh and existential construction simulator. Neither Tarkovsky nor Wim Wenders could have dreamed of such a thing. Everything here is like a real construction site (I say this as someone in the know): everything is done haphazardly, there is no plan, it's done haphazardly and you get no compensation. We are given a task, and we are thrown into a ""sandbox"" to solve it. But the physics in the game decide. The car rolls down a slope, and the camera is always attached not to the car, but to the car's gun! But realism... ten control buttons - and that's not the limit! With incredible difficulty, I got to the missions where you have to destroy buildings. Not quite what I expected, of course... but it was truly difficult, guys! Before going to a construction site again, I now always play this game for half an hour. I recommend playing it, but I don't recommend buying it!"

I've gotta say I should have listened to the reviews. I love the premise of the game: you're a construction business owner and you have to perform ""contracts"" (in which each contract is a small task like moving rocks or picking up bricks) to earn more money, buy new machines to have fun with and ultimately expand your business. The prospect of the new tasks are fun, but once it comes time to actually do them it just leaves you disappointed and actually frusturated. 

The controls are very sensitive yet completely unresponsive at the same time. For example, if you're attemting to gently manuever the front end loader around a rock so you don't hit it, just tapping the turning keys lightly doesn't turn the vehicle at all. However if you hold the key in for a slight second longer it turns the vehicle almost all of the way. One would believe performing pinpoint manuevers is a necessity in a cluttered construction yard but this game won't allow for it. Oh, it's worth mentioning if you actually DO run over the rock or obstacles you were trying to avoid, the physics are so bad that the whole truck behaves like a stiff piece wood with no shock absorbers at all and it just looks pathetic rigidly shaking around over what you just hit. The engines sound like a lawn tractor and they don't change noises based on your engine RPM's or activity, it just sounds like it's a constant idle. The music is so bad and repetitive I actually just shut it off completely and listened to the constantly-idling engine which then became annoying in itself. The graphics on the ""high"" setting also resemble that of a bad Nintendo 64 game but the camera angles are so frusturating to deal with so you barely get to see any of the poor graphics anyway! 

All in all it was a supurb idea that was poorly delivered in every way shape or form. I give it a 2 out of 5 for the excellent concept but totally poor construction (pun intended.)

I am not quite sure where the complaints are coming from but here is my personal experience. Brace yourself it is not exactly short. This will more be a review for people who want a bit more detail of the game instead of just a ""it sucks"" type of review.

Camera:
Press C and get into outside view, use left mouse button and can move camera any angle you like.
I could post the suggestion to maybe in the future put more camera control in all the views.


Graphics:
I have not seen an issue there either, when launching game it gives you options to change settings and so far am getting basically what I see in the trailer. If you experience lag, just lower your settings. It has its bumps and jolts here and there but nothing to make it unplayable for me.

(Will also add I am not sure how peoples CPUs and GPUs are overheating, Mine are all within normal temperature while running this game)

Gameplay:
Challenging at times. But I enjoy a challenge. The game will require you to take your time and go slow at times, you are not a racecar driver. But if you do you can complete your challenges, I have been able to complete all them first try so far.

You can flip your vehicles over so be careful. To me this just gets you to be careful while playing and adds to the challenge.

Yes some things will bounce around, but I only seemed to have that problem if I went at it like a bat out of hell. It just convinced me to take my time doing it which honestly allowed me to enjoy the game more.

I find it to be a decent simulation, you are doing just as it describes. If the game made it too easy on you and were able to rush whole thing would not be any playablitity.

This game I think is suitable for people into this genre of games, you must be willing to accept this genre before enjoying it. It will not be for everyone.

Tips
As for anyone having crashes or not starting here is some things I personally found that helped if I ever get an error. 
1) Do windows updates
2)Restart computer
3) Launch settings instead of game, click save and play. I have had this fix errors even if I didn't change the settings, is this gamebreaking? Not really as it is a 2 second solution. (If this is your problem. Not saying it will solve everyones but solved mine.)

Conclusion:
Is the game perfect? No, I am not saying it is, it has its flaws but what game doesn't?
The developer has also been quite active with the community to take in feedback which is a plus. Just give him your feedback if you see something, at least this game has an active one.

As for the price range, it is only $15, it is not like it is a $40-$60 AAA simulator game. I think the price range for this and how the game plays out is quite worth it for that range for people interested in the genre.

If I encouter any game breaking problems I will post it as well but so far my game is still running fine with the exception of the couple things I mentioned, all minor to me.","Well I have played 4 hours of it upon writing this review.

I have not seen an issue there either, when launching game it gives you options to change settings and so far am getting basically what I see in the trailer. If you experience lag, just lower your settings. It has its bumps and jolts here and there but nothing to make it unplayable for me.

(Will also add I am not sure how peoples CPUs and GPUs are overheating, Mine are all within normal temperature while running this game)

Gameplay:
Challenging at times. But I enjoy a challenge. The game will require you to take your time and go slow at times, you are not a racecar driver. But if you do you can complete your challenges, I have been able to complete all them first try so far.

You can flip your vehicles over so be careful. To me this just gets you to be careful while playing and adds to the challenge.

Yes some things will bounce around, but I only seemed to have that problem if I went at it like a bat out of hell. It just convinced me to take my time doing it which honestly allowed me to enjoy the game more.

I find it to be a decent simulation, you are doing just as it describes. If the game made it too easy on you and were able to rush whole thing would not be any playablitity.

This game I think is suitable for people into this genre of games, you must be willing to accept this genre before enjoying it. It will not be for everyone.

Tips
As for anyone having crashes or not starting here is some things I personally found that helped if I ever get an error. 
1) Do windows updates
2)Restart computer
3) Launch settings instead of game, click save and play. I have had this fix errors even if I didn't change the settings, is this gamebreaking? Not really as it is a 2 second solution. (If this is your problem. Not saying it will solve everyones but solved mine.)

Conclusion:
Is the game perfect? No, I am not saying it is, it has its flaws but what game doesn't?
The developer has also been quite active with the community to take in feedback which is a plus. Just give him your feedback if you see something, at least this game has an active one.

As for the price range, it is only $15, it is not like it is a $40-$60 AAA simulator game. I think the price range for this and how the game plays out is quite worth it for that range for people interested in the genre.

If I encouter any game breaking problems I will post it as well but so far my game is still running fine with the exception of the couple things I mentioned, all minor to me."

I truly regret spending 12 EURO on this game..... :-(

Joints on the machines act like theyve been attached with rubber bands, like when u put stress on them, theyll actually come apart and get drawn back together by an invisible force.

The game seems to combine the worst of reality and arcade into a big mess, which boils down to a truly crappy game.

Even older construction sims are way better than this one, its so disappointing and thats prolly why theres no trial download either, because they know that no one would buy it once theyve tried it.

I pretty much feel scammed by buying this game, all i can hope for is, that the mnoney I and others spent here, will go into supporting development of a descent new version of this game...","Poor physics makes the game impossible to play, especially when not using an analog controller.

Das Spiel kommt zwar scheinbar von den selben Entwicklern wie auch der KFZ-Werkstatt Simulator (welcher ja gar nicht so schlecht ist) allerdings verspricht das Spiel im Video mehr, als es halten kann. Ich habe nur den ersten Auftrag angesehen - das hat mir aber schon gereicht. Grafik ist teils ganz passabel, aber das Spielprinzip ist grauenvoll. Steuerung funktioniert nicht vernünftig, Fahrzeuge verhalten sich seltsam. Schade wieder Geld für nix ausgegeben.","Not a recommendation. While the game appears to be from the same developers as the Car Workshop Simulator (which isn't bad at all), the video promises more than it can deliver. I only watched the first job, but that was enough for me. The graphics are quite decent in places, but the gameplay is awful. The controls don't work properly, and the vehicles behave strangely. It's a shame, another waste of money."

The graphics and controls are really disappointing.... If the difficulty of a mobile game is 1, this game is 2-3 times harder....

There are a few things that I missed on my first playthrough. 1 There is a settings menu, which is great! unfortuatly messing around with the resolution a bit broke the game, my second screen, and my steam, Some how it inverted the colors and filled the screen with dots. Even then the menu screens still were in the wrong resolution and had big black bars at the top and bottom of the screen, In game it fit the screen fine. The second problem I ran into was to do with the physics, I had alot of very bad clipping problems with a few of them resulting in my loader or what ever I was picking up flying into the wall. The third problem was that nothing had any weight or feel to it, it felt as if I was driving a hover loader picking up things with a anti gravity device or something, because they all just slid around on the floor. The fourth thing was the default music was way too loud. While looking in the settings tab I found you could import your own music *HOLY SHIT* More games need to do that! I can see they were aiming for a realistic feel to the game but it was a bit off. When you are in the first person view you can't see very much so I use the free cam, the only problem with the free cam is most of the sounds are missing when you go into free cam *Engine sounds, Debris hitting the floor ect* The physics just freeze sometimes, the game is still running *rain falling and such* but the loader doesnt move at all. The game runs pretty choppy with fps drops about every 50 seconds. I will list my full pc specs aswell *16GB of RipJaw Z series ddr3 ram, Msi 970A G46, Amd fx 8350 Black Edition running at 4.0Ghz, Radeon 7870 Ghz Editio (Yes I know its bottlenecking right now I am saving up for another one but money is tight right now) and a 750W power suply* There we go I hope this review is less Bias :)","*Un Bias Review 2.0!* Ok First off I would like to say I am sorry for my first review it was mostly because I was in a bad mood after buying the game.
