It's just not good at all, an extremely frustrating game-like program that will leave you very depressed -- there could've been so much to this but the devs beat it with an ugly stick and made it stupid. Do not buy. Kinetic Avoid."

I wonder if I'm just stupid or if I need to try harder... No, it's just too unfriendly!
In any case, it seems like you have to shove all the modules you need to start the ship,
and complete it without missing a single part...
If they're going to make it that realistic,
I wish they'd explain it in a helpful tutorial-like way, like first you attach the basic parts of the ship,
then in the second stage you add thrusters or engines for movement,
and in the third stage you finally unlock weapons and can attach them and use them...
They explain everything in order, like dozens of UI systems, all at once, in the first scene,
and then you have to build them one by one from memory, and then you can't do anything about the parts that aren't explained unless you look at a guide...It's really hopeless!
Plus, it's been a few years since they abandoned updates, so I guess a crappy game is still a crappy game.
I can't even apply the workshop properly.
I'm tired of learning the UI, so I'm done with this game.
I'm quitting.

Kinetic Void could have been so much more.  If the developers had focussed on simple shipbuilding, and getting the gameplay right, this could have been another Kerbal Space Program. Sadly, it's been abandoned, and is missing a lot of what would have made it fun.   

So, having watched this for a few years,  I'm finally giving up on it ever being finished, and going to give it a thumbs down.  Don't waste your time on it. Play KSP if you want to make spaceships....

The idea was great, the game was okay-ish, but incomplete. In the early days they had some patches every now and then, and it seems like the game was on the right track. After a while the updates stopped, and i stopped hoping. 
At this point I had bought a few other EA games and learned a lesson on supporting EA games, that is only support ones that is trustworthy. 
The game lies forgotten in my Library, part of me hoping it will be complete and a part of me wishing i could just uninstall the darn thing so i can have my free space back for a better game.

Just remembered i had this 'thing', uninstalled it and decided to give a belated review, so people would be informed and not buy this incomplete 'thing'."

So I got Kinetic Void when it was on sale for about $5, thinking why not, then the trouble started.

The previews for the game show very good graphics with a beautiful star backdrop and detailed rendering of the ships, but with the latest update at over a year old, the skybox does not render meaning there are no stars, planets look like cheese, nebulae fog looks like sprites, etc etc, though the sun has a nice lens flare. Long story short, what you see in the previews is a little misleading.

The game itself is still in development but had been on hold for a year now, it has virtually no backstory and not alot to do within the game. You can of course try to make the beefiest ship alive and go fight pirates, but that gets old quickly. Eventually you find yourself building giant flyswatters and pitting them against Imperial Star Destroyers if you dare to load up the game again.

Possibly the only thing interesting about this game is it makes fan fiction possible, who would win, the Enterpise or a Starwars Republic Attack Cruiser, the Serenity or a Varkrey, an F-16 or a TIE fighter? Truthfully thats just about what this game has become due to lack of progress.

Видеообзор https://youtu.be/SiI9qFpOwVY","The game is from 2014. The only thing that's rather poorly done here is the space skinboxes. As for the game itself, like Azulgar, it allows you to assemble the ship of your dreams from parts to destroy enemies. Among its features, this game was the first I can remember that allowed you to fly to planets and attack enemy bases. The game also has a fairly large selection of building blocks, and there are many unique ships of varying strengths in space. There's also the ability to mine useful resources for those who enjoy mining and fighting, and you can also complete missions. Unfortunately, there's no trading as such. But the game was simply unique for that year, even with some balance. It was replaced by Avorion.

 - Placing ship sections is hella awkward
 - Removing ship sections is hella awkward (takes like, 5 clicks for a single section)
 - Adding weapons, once again, awkward (many clicks)
 - Adding engines, awkward
 - Adding anything = very awkward, time consuming, painful, not intuitive
 - UI is confusing
 - Travelling mechanics & controls don't make sense anymore
 - Missions also don't make sense
 - Trading...how do you even do that?
 - How do you arm weapons now? What's the button? Why is there no guidance on flight?
 - Controls & help are outdated, I doubt the dev remembers how it works without looking through code

Basically it was good, and I'd love it if they rolled the game back to what it was.

  For a while now, our biggest problem has been a lack of content once you’ve built your ship, and an in-depth economy    will be a major factor in creating a living world for the player to interact with. This week’s patch includes an early implementation that should give you a basic idea of where we want to go with it. 

So basically with the final release, we have an ""early implementation"" of a ""basic idea"" for the economy. I'm certainly not trying to be antagonistic here, but that just seems blatantly wrong to me. It feels pretty deceitful to sell a product as complete when it has clearly not been finished. I really wanted to like it. It was one of the first early-access titles I've purchased and I admit, the ship builder is pretty fun. Flying your ship, or interacting with the universe on any meaningful level seems non-existant. Combat is boring and janky, the economy sim is incomplete, and the whole thing reeks of alpha. For clarification, alpha as in the pre-beta stage, beta meaning the game is feature complete and only requires bug fixing, optimization, and testing. In essence I'm saying that things are missing. Overall, once you finish building your ship, you may as well just quit the game; it's peaked. That was the high point, that was the single most fun thing that you will ever do in this game. It's just boring. Obviously, no developer sets their sights on making a boring game. I'm not mad, I understand money and motivation don't last forever, but this game really should have been *so* much more than what is offered. The procedural random galaxy and shipbuilder alone must have been truly momental tasks to overcome. I don't know what happened with the devs (the forums are malfunctioning or have been removed as of this writing), but it's genuinely as though they just vanished.

Правда кинетик воид какой-то не кинетик, и даже не воид...
Разгон и остановка не зависят от веса корабля, может и зависят, но очень-то и заметно. Есть максимальная скорость, что очень противоречит названию. При чём максимальная скорость падает от увеличения массы корабля и от забивания трюма.
Камера вертится, если вертится корабль, что дико неудобно.
Карты нормальной нет. Нет инструмента, который бы внятно показал, что на каком расстоянии от корабля находится.
Вся информация о том, что игрок сделал с объектами солнечной системы стирается при заходе на станцию, и всё восстанавливается обратно, по этому мечта добыть все астероиды не совсем реальна оказывается.
Астероиды имют все по 5К хп. Что это значит - не ясно. Маленькие астероиды добываются быстрее больших, что логично, но количество ХП у всех одно.
Торговля - нормально, генерация и редактированеи корабля - нормально.
Почему-то инверитрованы кнопки вверх-вниз, что не логично, но можно сменить на нормальные.
Есть задания, но не много и генерируются они только в космосе и прямо в ксмосеи очень незатейливые. Хотя так и не удалось понять, как по заданию заказчику в космосе отдать ресурсы по двойной цене...
Какого-то смысла, кроме как построить кораблик в игре нет. Вообще нет. Играть дико скучно, ибо делать нечего.
А просто играться кубиками - можно.
Да, и контекстное меню у объектов почему-то рисуется ЗА ВСЕМИ объектами, что дико уложняет дествия. Да есть кнопка С, котора призвана выполнять действие ""mine asteroid"", но её дико глючит - если выделить следующий астероид и её снова нажать есть огромная вероятность, что прицел слетит с предыдущей цели. Так что остаётся только контекстное меню, которое рисуется всегда справа от объекта, и бывает вджруг перескакивает куда-то, может нарисоваться за пределами экрана, за HUD'ом.
В общем управление в игре очень не очень.","So, we have something resembling a space sim before us.

Actually, the kinetic void isn't really kinetic, or even void...
Acceleration and deceleration aren't affected by the ship's weight; maybe they are, but it's not very noticeable. There's a maximum speed, which belies the name. Moreover, the maximum speed decreases as the ship's mass increases and the cargo hold fills up.
The camera rotates when the ship rotates, which is incredibly inconvenient.
There's no proper map. There's no tool that would clearly show what's at what distance from the ship.
All information about the player's actions with solar system objects is erased upon entering a station, and everything is restored, so the dream of mining all the asteroids turns out to be unrealistic.
Asteroids all have 5K HP. What this means is unclear. Small asteroids are mined faster than large ones, which makes sense, but they all have the same HP. Trading is fine, ship generation and editing are fine.
For some reason, the up and down buttons are inverted, which doesn't make sense, but you can change them to normal.
There are missions, but not many, and they're generated only in space, and they're very simple right in the spacecraft. Although I still couldn't figure out how to give resources to a customer in space at double the price for a mission...
There's no point in the game other than building a ship. None at all. It's incredibly boring to play because there's nothing to do.
But just playing with dice is fine.
Oh, and for some reason the context menu for objects is drawn BEHIND ALL objects, which makes things incredibly difficult. Yes, there is a C button, which is supposed to perform the ""mine asteroid"" action, but it's incredibly glitchy—if you select the next asteroid and press it again, there's a high chance your aim will drift off the previous target. So all that's left is the context menu, which is always drawn to the right of the object, and sometimes suddenly jumps somewhere, sometimes even drawing off-screen, behind the HUD.
Overall, the game's controls are really bad."

Anyway, I agree with the general consensus: The ship builder side of the game is very functional, and the Workshop is full of awesome ships (and mechs even!) built by members of the playerbase that can be downloaded for your playthroughs. (After you fix them - don't forget the fact that a number of Workshop ships are technically incomplete, with not all of the subsystems set, and often with far too many subsystems than the other parts can handle. Too many hangar bays is a common example.) The learning curve for the shipbuilder is kind of steep, but like I said, quite functional.

Outside of the shipbuilder, it's cool that you can set up a randomly-generated sandbox galaxy to mess around in according to some parameters that you set during generation - namely, galaxy size and number of factions. It gives a lot of play area, though there's no guaruntee your ship (even the workshop ones) will have the warp range to reach other parts of the galaxy. There are missions, pirates who nobody cares if you go hunting, and faction-relations mechanics - all of which are good.

The thing is, outside of that it just feels bare. In 8 hours of play I've only encountered ""go hear and kill what you find"" missions. I haven't delved into the economy or career mode, true, but no ""sandbox"" should ever feel like there's nothing to do - and that's exactly how this game makes me feel. Sure, I can warp across the galaxy into pirate-held sectors and go to town with a downloaded Star Destroyer or HMS Warspite, sure I can rescue traders from pirate fighters and kill a smuggler or six, and sure it can be enjoyable all the same - I was giddy when I launched in my downloaded Super Star Destroyer and found it to be larger than the space station it was docked at, but all in all I can't really recommend this game. 

I bought it summer of last year, expecting it to improve in time, but it really doesn't seem to have gone anywhere. Whether or not the devs are still working on it behind the scenes I'm not really sure. I am sure though that this game has huge potential, but as it is now fails to live up to it. Right now all it's really good for is destroying everything you see. While enjoyable by itself, it gets old when you run into an enemy or 6 using the same ship as you, and that ship is some form of battleship which had until then slaughtered helpless foes. Especially when those enemies are pirates. 

I have limited hard drive space, and I am afraid that I'm going to have to uninstall to make room for other, more fleshed-out games. I might still come back to it eventually, see how it's changed (if at all).

While enjoyable by itself, it gets old when you run into an enemy or 6 using the same ship as you, and that ship is some form of battleship which had until then slaughtered helpless foes. Especially when those enemies are pirates. 

I have limited hard drive space, and I am afraid that I'm going to have to uninstall to make room for other, more fleshed-out games. I might still come back to it eventually, see how it's changed (if at all). I just hope the potential here doesn't remain wasted."

15453912,russian,2015.03.19 23:19,✅,✅,0.5,0,"Когда-то давно, может год назад, я купил эту игру, немного поиграл и забросил. Тогда меня неустроил непонятный редактор, непонятно было что делать в плане геймплея. Почему-то я летал очень уныло и орудия не стреляли.

Прошёл год, игра пообновилась, стала более понятной. Стало ясно, пушки не стеляют, если в них не поставить ствол. Редактор кривоватый, но всё же в нём я смог слепить сначала кубик с кабиной, пушкой и движком. Потом файтер на подобии стокового. На момент написания обзора у меня в ангаре в компании находится фрегат, который может надрать корму местным космо-шлюпкам.

Что я считаю плюсом в игре:
+ конструктор, кривой но он есть! И это хорошо!
+ пополняемый контент из Workshop. Иногда попадаются корабли, на которые оформлена подписка. Всёже лучше чем с однообразными стоковыми.
+ выбор рода деятельности - источника дохода. Можешь выполнять миссии, или ковырять астероиды лазером, или спекулировать в торговле, или просто воевать и собирать цветмет с покрасневших космо-шлюпок.
+ детализация кораблей. То есть сегментов кораблей и их большое количество. Есть возможность построить действительно красивый и детализированый корабль.

Что мне ненравится в игре:
- недоработаный геймплей. Если разрабы считают его законченым, то это грустно :( Почему нельзя присоедениться к фракции или создать свою и строить корабли, захватывать станции вместе с солнечными системами, к примеру.
- ограниченное бесконечное пространство. Астероиды луны станции и армада всегда находятся на солнечной стороне планеты. За планетой и в удалении - бесконечная пустота.
- медленный геймплей. Всё вокруг плавает очень медленно. Если разогнаться свыше 2х тысяч, то ещё чувствыется драйв, но на огромных дредноутах которые ползают по 300 скучно.
- ОООООООчень отсталая графика. Спрайты тумана, непонятное мерцание со стороны звезды. небольшая сфера видимости.

Что не могу отнести ни к плюсам ни к минусам:
* ИИ. Он тупой - корабли врезаются в планеты на варпе, врезаются друг в друга в пылу схватки и при загрузке сектора. Но он понимает угрозы - не вступает в бой если не может одолеть, преследует и убегает.
* песочница. Игрок волен как птица. Перед ним не ставится никаких целей, только необязательные миссии.

Итог:
Игра мне лично нравится. Она хорошо убивает время и несмотря на убогую картинку атмосферы радует глаз металлический блеск творения бережно слепленого в ангаре.
Оценка (сугубо личная): 6 из 10.","A long time ago, maybe a year ago, I bought this game, played it a bit, and then abandoned it. Back then, I was frustrated by the confusing editor; I couldn't figure out what to do with the gameplay. For some reason, flying was incredibly dull and the guns weren't firing.

A year passed, the game was updated, and it became more understandable. It became clear that guns don't fire unless you install a barrel in them. The editor is a bit clunky, but I was still able to cobble together a cube with a cockpit, gun, and engine. Then, a fighter similar to the stock one. At the time of writing, I have a frigate in my hangar that could give the local spaceships a run for their money.

What I consider the game's strengths:
+ The builder, albeit a bit clunky, but it's there! And that's good!
+ Upgradable content from the Workshop. Sometimes you come across ships you've subscribed to. It's still better than the monotonous stock ones.
+ Choice of occupation—a source of income. You can complete missions, or mine asteroids with a laser, or speculate in trade, or simply fight and collect non-ferrous metal from reddened spaceships.
+ Ship detailing. That is, ship segments and a large number of them. It's possible to build a truly beautiful and detailed ship.

What I don't like about the game:
- Underdeveloped gameplay. If the developers consider it finished, that's sad :( Why can't I join a faction or create my own and build ships, capture stations and solar systems, for example?
- Limited, infinite space. Asteroids, stations, and armadas are always on the sunny side of the planet. Beyond the planet and in the distance, there's endless emptiness.
- Slow gameplay. Everything moves very slowly. If you accelerate past 2,000, you can still feel the thrill, but on huge dreadnoughts crawling at 300, it's boring.
- Very, very poor graphics. Fog sprites, strange flickering from the side of a star, small field of view.

What I can't classify as either a pro or a cons:
* AI. It's dumb – ships crash into planets at warp, crash into each other in the heat of battle, and when loading a sector. But it understands threats – it doesn't engage in combat if it can't. Overcome, pursue, and escape.
* Sandbox. The player is as free as a bird. There are no goals, only optional missions.

Summary:
I personally like the game. It's a great time-killer, and despite the poor atmospherics, the metallic sheen of the creation, carefully crafted in the hangar, is pleasing to the eye.
Rating (strictly personal): 6 out of 10."

The gameplay has struggled through the Early Acess with odd glitches here and there, and the end result isn't much removed from what it was before release.

The game concept is a rather free-flowing gameplay mechanic to build your own starship, but the game's design is somewhat flawed on both balancing acts of manuverability vs firepower and basic instructions. This takes a whole other level just to explain how to play the game, and to be honest that isn't right for something like this. The basics of the game weapons are Lasers, Cannons and Missiles. Point-defense systems, cargo, salvage and mining are options for a ""career"" play to build up resources however the grind is long and boring. Ship movement is your typical thrusters and a hyperspace system to jump from point A to B faster, however when jumping you loose your perception on distance and its an annoying wait to see when the ship feels like ending the trip near the target. The shield is a more literal ""kinetic field Generator"" to protect the ship from damage, but limits movement. You go faster with it off, but take damge to the hull without a shield to cover your rear.

To complicate matters the ship construction designs are done impressively free, able to freely rotate and adjust segments any combination you desire without distance restrictions or locking points - but it comes back to bite the design mechanic in how over-use of too many blocks can kill the gameplay performance. Some moderate limitations have been done to limit weapons and design, but it falls back to an inherit issue with the firepower and accuracy. There is no need for thinking small here, bigger ships, more power, shields and weapons will always do better. It makes any ammount of small craft obsolete and limits the gameplay feel - and punishes you for it as the ship becomes more sluggish with its size increasing. It makes the gameplay drag on in a rather negative way.

I admit its a fun way to loose hours in it, crafting a unique ship - but you'll be so drained when done and after flying it for only short distances you'll not want to actually play with it much after.

The game itself remains largely shallow in its build. No real story, gameplay or function - just create a random set of stars and factions/corporations and choose who you blow up basically. The faction loyalties shift freely with each fight, but it lacks heavily in the substance department for the actual game. No kind of character exists outside nameless portraits and your own nickname. In the basic Career mode you start with a small ship and grind up, but can just kick off in Sandbox to build whatever then just fly faster without the tedious grinding spree to build up to the big ship.

It is a great concept, plenty of heart in it to be honest - but its end application feels lacking, and in a really big way. Pick it up if your really interested in its unique way of doing things, but be wary there isn't much here.","I love the idea.

Point-defense systems, cargo, salvage and mining are options for a ""career"" play to build up resources however the grind is long and boring. Ship movement is your typical thrusters and a hyperspace system to jump from point A to B faster, however when jumping you loose your perception on distance and its an annoying wait to see when the ship feels like ending the trip near the target. The shield is a more literal ""kinetic field Generator"" to protect the ship from damage, but limits movement. You go faster with it off, but take damge to the hull without a shield to cover your rear.

To complicate matters the ship construction designs are done impressively free, able to freely rotate and adjust segments any combination you desire without distance restrictions or locking points - but it comes back to bite the design mechanic in how over-use of too many blocks can kill the gameplay performance. Some moderate limitations have been done to limit weapons and design, but it falls back to an inherit issue with the firepower and accuracy. There is no need for thinking small here, bigger ships, more power, shields and weapons will always do better. It makes any ammount of small craft obsolete and limits the gameplay feel - and punishes you for it as the ship becomes more sluggish with its size increasing. It makes the gameplay drag on in a rather negative way.

I admit its a fun way to loose hours in it, crafting a unique ship - but you'll be so drained when done and after flying it for only short distances you'll not want to actually play with it much after.

The game itself remains largely shallow in its build. No real story, gameplay or function - just create a random set of stars and factions/corporations and choose who you blow up basically. The faction loyalties shift freely with each fight, but it lacks heavily in the substance department for the actual game. No kind of character exists outside nameless portraits and your own nickname. In the basic Career mode you start with a small ship and grind up, but can just kick off in Sandbox to build whatever then just fly faster without the tedious grinding spree to build up to the big ship.

It is a great concept, plenty of heart in it to be honest - but its end application feels lacking, and in a really big way. Pick it up if your really interested in its unique way of doing things, but be wary there isn't much here."

Die Schuld ist gleichmäßig zwischen steam und den Produzenten verteilt da sich beide auf Kosten der menschlichen Neugier bereichern ohne nennenswerte Leistungen zu erbringen. Man gibt Geld aus in der Hoffnung mit etwas Spaß belohnt zu werden welcher zu 85% auf der Strecke bleibt. 
19.99€ für ein Spiel was einfach nur Schrott ist und auch nie über diesen Status hinaus kommen wird!

Fazit:
Mein gesamtbild von steam ist eigentlich positiv aber an Early Aces bzw. Kickstarter kann man sich leicht die Finger verbrennen .... vlt. sollte Steam ne bessere Vorauswahl treffen und nicht jeden Hirnverbrannten mit einer Idee fördern ...
den Kunden und deren Geldbeutel zu liebe","Ridiculous... I'm slowly starting to have real doubts about Steam's Kickstarter project. In my opinion, about 80-90% are for the trash, just like this game, which has been in production for ages!

The blame is evenly distributed between Steam and the producers, as both enrich themselves at the expense of human curiosity without delivering anything significant. You spend money hoping to be rewarded with some fun, which 85% of the time falls by the wayside.
€19.99 for a game that's simply garbage and will never rise above that status!

Conclusion:
My overall impression of Steam is actually positive, but it's easy to burn your fingers on early aces or Kickstarter.... Maybe Steam should make a better pre-selection and not support every crazy person with an idea...

This seemed to be the game that would fill the void left in the absence of Elite, Escape Velocity, or a good X game after the abomination that is Rebirth.  Unfortunatley as development trucked along, much more slowly than originally promised at that, features in development began to be cut.  First the scale of the universe was reduced, then the Newtonian physics that were one of the huge selling points of the game were cut in favor of a ""simplified"" traditional flight model that has ships slow down when engines are cut, turn like atmospheric craft, and have velocity rather than acceleration limits (and these limits are VERY small, measured in triple-diget KPH in the enormity of a solar system).

The robust mission and faction system never materialized, leaving players with very little more to do than in alpha stages.  Basically you can trade legitimatley, or pirate and sale.  The universe offers almost nothing else to do.  There are no indications of where one can buy and sell items let alone how the prices will fluctuate nor what ship modules will be available until you reach a system in the tiny galaxies generated each new time you start a game.  Even then what faction controls a star system (the number of which can be ajusted when you create a galaxy, but they are nothing more than interchangable names and their influence almost never changes for any reason).

The one good thing that I can say about this game is that the ship editor is fairly large.  It was reduced in features since the alpha, again in an attempt to simplify which they failed at anyway, but still offers many options in terms of ship design.  The wide range of vessels both original and copies of famous ships from sci-fi series does attest to this.  Unfortunatley there is nothing to do with your ship other than mindlessly shoot other ships.

If you think that Elite: Dangerous doesn't give you enough help in the universe nor enough interaction with the economy, NPCs, or factions, then stay away from this game.  The tutorials, to the VERY limited extent they exist at all, teach you nothing and somehow saying you recieve no guidence manages to be an understatement.  Even the graphics are nothing to write home about.

The reason is that, apparently, if you don't write a review for Kinetic Void on Steam, your opinion about this game doesn't count. The developer Sean Pollman a.k.a.

Kinetic Void is a ""game"" (I am very reluctant to call KV in its current state a game, but I'll get to that in time) that had spent three years in development. Unfortunately, the state in which the ""game"" happens to be now doesn't reflect it a least bit. From very basic, spartan, ugly and sometimes non-functional UI, to a very poor amount of content in the game (there's really just nothing to do beyond the ship builder).

The rest is just flying in empty space (you can also enter the atmosphere of any planet, only to be presented with a close-up sight of bland atrocious-resolution textures), shooting at enemy ships and mining (consisting of concentrating your mining beam on an asteroid for dulling amount of time). And that's about it.

Three years of development after which Kinetic Void left Early Access program and was labeled a ""finished"" product (despite still being in the same unfinished state as it'd been always before). That was in November 2014. Now it's almost April 2015 and no progress whatsoever has been made to make the ""game"" actually working or to expand its direly lacking features. Only a few patches with no actual improvements, save for some bugfixes, came out since that time. Just take a look at the patch announcement history. 
""[i]But wait, the developers just have a lot on their plate right now and maybe they get to it later and right the respective wrongs[/i],"" you may say. Now, bear in mind that Sean Pollman said himself on the forums that his team has dissolved, and that they're now down to only two people ""working"" on the ""game"" (you have to take this in with a very open mind, since that ""work"" is nowhere to be seen on the ""game"") and that they've also opened a brick & mortar board-game store, plus they've started working on ""another small project"" to cover their costs. 
[b]Yes, two people are working on Kinetic Void, manning their store and then even working on another ""small project"", all at the same time.[/b] Go figure how long will it take to shape Kinetic Void into anything resembling a ""working state"" (also bear in mind that to get in its current sorry and unfinished state, it took three years for KV, and that's with more people working on it full-time). I'd wager that it'll take forever and then some, but I'm open to bets.

Based on all the mentioned, it's no wonder that negative reviews started rolling in after the ""game"" was made ""final"" in November last year.

When the ""release"" came week later, I was quite (negatively) surprised by that but I decided to wait a few months to see how the things would unveil. 
We already know how it all actually went, so it's no wonder that I started getting pissed off, along with many other former fans of the ""game"".

This is another Early Access dud where they slap a 1.0 on it (to cash in on the sales that might generate...which it did not), expect the community to finish it, then spend time making excuses about how Steam wouldn't allow them to put it back into the Early Access program while lashing out at their customers for not crowdfunding someone's dream and being happy about the results when it was prematurely released with poor communication surrounding it.

That is exactly what LumberingTroll (developer) did, and when people pointed this out in a thread asking if the game was still being developed - after the dev wasn't communicating with the community shortly after the ""Spacebase Treatment"" of slapping a 1.0 on a title then bailing to start up a physical game store without letting those following the game know what was going on in dev plans - LumberingTroll called everyone ""retarded"" and then deleted the thread when it appeared that he might have to face responsibility for his own actions.

Yes, apparently game developers - the REAL Steam customers while everyone else is supposed to be happy with poor faith business practices - are allowed to break the Steam posting rules whenever they feel like it and can only be held ""responsible"" by deleting the incriminating evidence from the virtual sandbox Steam gives them to do whatever to the ""lesser customers"" - also known as ""marks"" - only when it embarrasses them.

The problem with that is that people were otherwise mostly forgiving up until the ""Spacebase Treatment"" and the childish forum whitewashing.

You thought you had a problem with ""bad reviews"" before, LumberingTroll?

You just gave people reason to write more.

Maybe next time you'll bother to treat your customers in the same respect you wish to be treated, but until this developer does some serious reparations I would suggest to avoid the developer's dysfunction at all possibilities.  Those antics changed my position from a silent ""wouldn't recommend until it becomes more complete"" to a ""until this developer removes their head from their backside, continuing to pay attention to them might in itself deserve a refund"".

14854970,russian,2015.02.12 23:36,❌,✅,0.6977552176,24,"Kinetic Void легче рассматривать как две игры в одной: конструктор кораблей и космическую ""песочницу"".

Первая - представляет собой замысловатый 3D редактор кораблей, снабжённый довольно скучным и дотошным обучением. Быстро построить ""хоть что-то"" и взлететь не получится, но любители поковыряться в настройках и узлах могут создать корабль по своему вкусу.  Игроку доступно несколько десятков готовых модулей в 5 размерах, которые можно без ограничений вращать, стыковать и раскрашивать. Особых требований к конструкции нет - лишь бы была кабина, хотя бы один корпус и двигатель, а также пара-тройка внутренних подсистем. Одним словом, в Steam Workshop настоящее раздолье: тут есть ""Тысячелетний Сокол"" и имперский ""Звёздный разрушитель"" из ""Звёздных войн"", знаменитый корабль из сериала ""Светлячок"", ""Kestrel"" из FTL.

А вот вторая половина удалась куда хуже. Так называемая ""песочница"" выглядит как неумелая калька с EVE Online, даже выбор целей и контекстное меню схожи. Даром, что кораблём можно управлять с клавиатуры - эффективно передвигаться тут можно исключительно в ""варп бабле"". Даже интерфейс в какой-то мере похож на исландскую ММО.

Однако, главная проблема Kinetic Void - абсолютно пустой мир, в котором нечего делать. И хотя карта каждый раз создаётся случайным образом, тут каждый раз одинаково скучно. Миссии, ""фарм"" репуации с фракциями, добыча минералов, торговля... Всё сделано настолько топорно и бездушно, что это усыпляет лучше любого снотворного.","Kinetic Void is best thought of as two games in one: a ship builder and a space sandbox.

The first is a complex 3D ship editor, complete with a rather tedious and meticulous tutorial. You won't be able to quickly build ""anything"" and take off, but those who enjoy tinkering with the settings and components can create a ship to their liking. Players have access to several dozen pre-made modules in five sizes, which can be freely rotated, joined, and painted. There are no specific design requirements – just a cockpit, at least one hull and engine, and a couple of internal subsystems. In short, Steam Workshop is a real treat: there's the Millennium Falcon and the Imperial Star Destroyer from Star Wars, the famous ship from Firefly, and the Kestrel from FTL.

The second half, however, is far less successful. The so-called ""sandbox"" feels like a crude rip-off of EVE Online; even the target selection and context menu are similar. Although you can control your ship with the keyboard, effective navigation is only possible in the warp bubble. Even the interface is somewhat reminiscent of an Icelandic MMO.

However, Kinetic Void's main problem is its completely empty world, with nothing to do. And although the map is randomly generated each time, it's equally boring. Missions, reputation farming with factions, mineral mining, trading... Everything is so crude and soulless that it's more numbing than any sleeping pill."

Das einzige was KV wirklich gut macht ist der Part mit dem man sich Schiffe aus vorgefertigten Teilen bauen kann. Die Möglichkeiten sind hier enorm hoch und die Community ist sehr kreativ. Das war es dann auch. Was hier am Sandkasten Prinzip angepriesen wird ist im Grunde sehr eingeschränkt. Wenn das eigene Schiff fertig ist darf man versuchen damit herumzufliegen, Missionen bestreiten (flieg-dahin-töte-alles-komm-zurück) oder Bergabau an Asteroiden durchführen. 

Die Steuerung ist äußerst unintuitiv und das Interface grausam unübersichtlich. Vorallem beim Verkauf von Waren in Stationen fällt dies auf. Die Community hat seit geraumer Zeit auf Tutorials gehofft, diese sind aber selbst nach Release (!) nur in Textform enthalten. Missionen funktionieren nur bedingt (verbuggt) und versprochener Missionseditor ist immer noch nicht im Spiel implementiert. Fraktionen sind vorhanden und haben eine Freund/Feind einstellung gegenüber dem Spieler, allerdings verlassen sie nie ihr Territorium um zB. gegen Nachbarn Krieg zu führen (also keine großen Massenschlachten, alles eher statisch). 

Version 1.0 kam für alle sehr überraschend, da das Spiel noch lange nicht fertig war. Dies wurde in den Foren auch mehrfach diskutiert und letztendlich von den Entwicklern geblockt.

Natürlich ist der Tonfall nicht immer sauber und es ist verständlich das man empfindlich reagiert wenn es das eigene Produkt geht, aber Kritik wird generell schnell unterbunden. 

Anhand der schlechten Rezensionen fragen mittlerweile die Entwickler was für Verbesserungen die Spieler an KV vorschlagen. Dies bleibt aber nur im Rahmen was schon existiert, d.h. also keine neuen Inhalte. 

Was mir persönlich gegen den Strich geht, ist nicht das Inhaltslose Spiel, sondern die Tatsache das KV auf Kickstarter erfolgreich war und das sie zusätzlich auf den Early Access Zug von Steam mit aufgesprungen sind. Dennoch scheinen sie nicht genug Mittel (oder Willen) zu haben aus KV ein richtiges Spiel zu programmieren. Sie beteuern zwar immer wieder das sie es weiter unterstützen, aber anhand der nach dem Release veröffentlichten Patches kann man sehen das da nur Bugbereinigung kommt.


!!! Update !!! (18.03.2015): 
Seit Januar war es etwas still in um Kinetic Void und die Leute haben nun schon diskutiert ob das Spiel ""verlassen"" wurde, da zeitgleich ein Brettspielladen unter selben Logo und Namen der Entwickler in der ""stillen Zeit"" gegründet wurde. https://www.facebook.com/BadlandGaming?ref=ts&fref=ts

Der Thread der zur Erklärung des Ganzen dienen sollte wurde nun leider gelöscht. Als der Entwickler etwas ausfallend wurde, hat ihn der Steamuser Starbug wegen Beleidigung gemeldet und wurde dafür aus den KV Foren gebannt.

Hier ein Bildnachweis des Posts des Enwicklers (LumberingTroll) vom genannten User:
"" http://imgur.com/nyzSXdj

Message is quoted as reported. I was banned for reporting him""

Die Herzen bedeuten ""r e t a r d e d""

Zusammenfassung des Statements zur momentanen Situation in KV:
-> 2 Leute haben das Entwicklerteam verlassen
-> die 2 verbleibenden Entwickler arbeiten (simultan?) an einem anderen Projekt, die gemischten Userwertungen führen zu geringen Verkäufen = wenig Geld für KV für so ""viele"" entwickler
-> Steam lässt diesen Titel nicht wieder (!) ins Early Access Programm rein
-> der Brettspieleladen soll das Budget aufstocken und das leere Büro füllen
-> KV wird nicht aufgegeben - dennoch keine neuen Features da ja alles schon im Spiel enthalten ist was versprochen wurde - doch die Entwicklung wird sich stark verlangsamen
-> das Bewertungssystem bei Steam ist so nicht in Ordnung, da Leute bei einer Durschnittswertung von ""Gemischt oder mixed"" das Spiel nicht kaufen würden (überraschung!)
-> alles wird noch mal relativiert das man selbst Schuld sei dieses Spiel gekauft zu haben, man hätte ja wissen können das so ein kleines Entwicklerteam nicht solchen Anforderungen (der Spieler)  gerecht werden könne

Wer gerne etwas tiefer in die Materie gehen will, sollte sich dieses Review samt Kommentaren (Englisch) zu gemüte führen. Es zeigt deutliche Hinweise das Geld nicht nur in die Entwicklung von KV hineingeflossen ist sondern für private Zwecke genutzt wurde:

http://steamcommunity.com/id/lOriginalR/recommended/227160/

Wie es scheint hat der User (Entwickler) LumberingTroll nach der Kickstarter Kampagne von Kinetic Void kontinuierlich seine Steam Bibliothek mit ""triple a"" Titeln jeweils zum Vollpreis (also zum Release) gefüllt und selbst auf Kickstarter 141 Brettspiele (!) unterstützt. Anhand der Kickstarter Kommentare lässt sich feststellen, dass er nicht nur zwei oder drei Dollar, sondern so viel investiert hat, dass er das jeweilige Brettspiel auch zugeschickt bekommt. D.h. pro Brettspiel kann man mindestens (meist noch mehr das es ja kein digitales Gut ist) 20-25 $ zählen.

Steamprofil: http://steamcommunity.com/id/LumberingTroll
Kickstarterprofil: https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/seanpollman

Gleichzeitig beschwert er sich nun das er ein armer Entwickler sei der momentan kein Geld in KV investieren kann.


!!! Update 2 !!! (15.12.2015): Der Entwickler sucht in dem Steam Forum nach neuen Mitarbeitern 

http://steamcommunity.com/app/227160/discussions/0/541907867779253146/

Viel mehr passiert hier auch nicht. Der Entwickler meldet sich nur wenn es wirklich wichtig ist oder der Eindruck entstehen könne niemand lese das Forum. Mittlerweile ist nur noch das Forum ""Fragen"" für die Außenwelt sichtbar, nur die Leute die das Spiel auch besitzen haben den kompletten Zugriff.

http://steamcommunity.com/app/227160/discussions/1/537405286649714540/#c458604254434100892

Hier steht es offiziell: Da er LumberingTroll keine Ahnung vom Programmieren hat, steht KV erst mal auf Eis. Modsupport wird nicht kommen da schlicht das Wissen dafür fehlt. Da dieses ""Spiel"" anscheinend immer noch ein wenig Geld einbringt wird es auch keine opensource unterstützung geben.


Seit 2 Jahren keine Updates (weder contentupdates noch bugfixes). Wer sich dieses Spiel kauft ist selber Schuld, denn das rechtfertigt nicht einmal dieser halbe ""shipbuilder"". Jeder der dieses Spiel nun kauft, unterstützt nur den Brettspieleladen des Entwicklers und ich garantiere das sich hier nichts mehr tun wird.


Leider sprengt der Kommentar das Zeichenlimit für dieses Kackspiel. Im Kommentarbereich noch eine Einsicht eines ehemaligen Mitarbeiters.





//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Kurzfassung: Schaut euch die Screenshots und Artworks an und ihr kennt 98% des Spiels -> Bau ein Schiff und führe das in einem leeren, großen und langweiligen Raum gassi. Die Ausrede mimimi es ist doch Alpha zieht nicht mehr. Da nun auch seitens der Entwickler keine Kommunikation mehr erfolgt, ist meine Hoffnung nun endgültig gestorben das aus diesem ""Ship-building simulator"" noch was brauchbares wird. Zudem ist das soziale Verhalten des Entwicklers unter aller Sau. Leider scheint es auch so als wäre ein Teil des Kickstarter/Steam Geldes nicht ins Spiel sondern in einen Brettspieleladen investiert worden. Der übrigens pleite ging.

Name ist hier Programm.","(Important update below!!! December 15, 2015) + (Insight from a former employee Sometime in 2021 or so)

The only thing KV really does well is the part where you can build ships from prefabricated parts. The possibilities are enormous, and the community is very creative. That's it. What's being touted here in terms of the sandbox principle is essentially very limited. Once your ship is finished, you can try flying around with it, completing missions (fly there, kill everything, come back), or mining asteroids.

The controls are extremely unintuitive, and the interface is terribly confusing. This is especially noticeable when selling goods in stations. The community has been hoping for tutorials for some time, but even after release (!), they are only available in text form. Missions only work partially (buggy), and the promised mission editor is still not implemented in the game. Factions exist and have a friend/enemy stance toward the player, but they never leave their territory to wage war against neighbors, for example (so no large-scale battles; everything is rather static).

Version 1.0 came as a big surprise to everyone, as the game was far from finished. This was discussed several times in the forums and ultimately blocked by the developers.

Of course, the tone isn't always clean, and it's understandable that people react sensitively when it comes to their own product, but criticism is generally quickly suppressed.

Based on the negative reviews, the developers are now asking players what improvements they're suggesting for KV. However, this only remains within the scope of what already exists, meaning no new content.

What personally bothers me isn't the lack of content, but the fact that KV was successful on Kickstarter and that they also jumped on Steam's Early Access bandwagon. Nevertheless, they don't seem to have enough resources (or will) to develop KV into a proper game. They repeatedly claim to continue supporting it, but based on the patches released after the release, it's clear that only bug fixes are being released.

!!! Update!!! (March 18, 2015):
Since January, things have been a bit quiet around Kinetic Void, and people have already started discussing whether the game has been ""abandoned,"" since a board game store with the same logo and developer name was founded during the ""quiet period."" https://www.facebook.com/BadlandGaming?ref=ts&fref=ts

The thread intended to explain this has unfortunately been deleted. When the developer became somewhat abusive, Steam user Starbug reported him for insulting him and was subsequently banned from the KV forums.

Here is an image credit from the developer's (LumberingTroll) post by the user mentioned:
"" http://imgur.com/nyzSXdj

Message is quoted as reported. I was banned for reporting him""

The hearts mean ""retarded""

Summary of the statement on the current situation in KV:
-> 2 people have left the development team
-> The 2 remaining developers are working (simultaneously?) on another project, the mixed user ratings lead to low sales = little money for KV for so ""many"" developers
-> Steam will not allow this title back (!) into the Early Access program
-> The board game store should increase the budget and fill the empty office
-> KV will not be abandoned - but there will be no new features since everything promised is already included in the game - but development will slow down significantly
-> The rating system on Steam is not correct, as people with an average rating of ""Mixed"" or mixed"" wouldn't buy the game (surprise!)
-> everything is put into perspective by saying that it's their own fault for buying this game; they should have known that such a small development team couldn't meet such demands (of the players).

If you'd like to delve a little deeper, you should read this review and comments (in English). It shows clear indications that the money wasn't just invested in the development of KV, but was also used for private purposes:

http://steamcommunity.com/id/lOriginalR/recommended/227160/

It seems that after the Kinetic Void Kickstarter campaign, the user (developer) LumberingTroll continuously filled his Steam library with ""triple-A"" titles, each at full price (i.e., at release), and even backed 141 board games (!) on Kickstarter. Based on the Kickstarter comments, it's clear that he invested not just two or three dollars, but so much that he even received the respective board games. This means you can expect at least $20-25 per board game (usually more since it's not a digital product).

Steam profile: http://steamcommunity.com/id/LumberingTroll
Kickstarter profile: https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/seanpollman

At the same time, he's now complaining that he's a poor developer who can't currently invest any money in KV.

!!! Update 2!!! (12/15/2015): The developer is looking for new employees in the Steam forum.

http://steamcommunity.com/app/227160/discussions/0/541907867779253146/

Not much else is happening here. The developer only posts when it's really important or when the impression might arise that no one reads the forum. Now, only the ""Questions"" forum is visible to the outside world, and only people who actually own the game have full access.

http://steamcommunity.com/app/227160/discussions/1/537405286649714540/#c458604254434100892

Here's the official information: Since LumberingTroll has no clue about programming, KV is on hold for the time being. Mod support will not be forthcoming due to a lack of knowledge. Since this ""game"" apparently still makes a little money, there will be no open source support either.

No updates (neither content updates nor bug fixes) for two years. Anyone who buys this game has only themselves to blame, because not even this half-baked ""shipbuilder"" justifies it. Anyone who buys this game now is only supporting the developer's board game store, and I guarantee that nothing more will happen here.

Unfortunately, this comment exceeds the character limit for this crappy game. In the comments section, you'll find some insight from a former employee.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Summary: Look at the screenshots and artwork and you'll know 98% of the game -> Build a ship and drive it around an empty, large, and boring room. The ""whine it's alpha"" excuse doesn't work anymore. Since there's no more communication from the developers, my hope that this ""ship-building simulator"" will ever become anything useful has finally died. Furthermore, the developer's social media presence is abysmal. Unfortunately, it also seems as if part of the Kickstarter/Steam money wasn't invested in the game, but in a board game store. Which, by the way, went bankrupt.

I was an active part of the community at the time, doing screenshots and showing off ships, complementing eachothers' ships, writing guides, giving feedback to the developers.

6 months later I grew tired of the slow updating (as well as the game) so I stopped playing it as actively as I once was. 3 months after that I stopped completely.

I patiently waited for new updates that came once per 3-4 months at a time sometimes, and briefly brought myself to speed with how things were.

Then they began to rush the release. I could tell because they suddenly sped up the alpha states faster than the content actually generated. From .022 to a .#, and then to simply d.#, like they were trying to rename the process to give the illusion of progress. Then the release came. I, like many other backers, was immensly disapointed with the game.

While real progress was made in these 2 years, the progress could have easily fit into one year. 

Don't get me wrong, the shipbuilder is GREAT. Or, at least last time I checked.

But then you're in space. It can get really laggy, and there isn't much to do. I don't mind having all the lore of the universe in your head, but developers promised economy systems, intricate faction mechanics, ect. Nothing is intricate.

Even if this was still in alpha I would give a shaky reccomendation at best. Progress was slow, but continuing.

While I'm glad to hear that the devs are still working on it, the statement of calling it a 1.00 version as well as the specific avoidance of promises about what will or will not make it into the game still turn me off enough to wish I had put my money somewhere else, though I admit there's an outside chance I could reinstall on a whim in a year or two and be pleasantly surprised.

So to sum up, the shipbuilding aspect is very well done and I'd say it's probably a lot less confusing than it might seem at first if you just take a few minutes to adjust yourself. It might still be a little obtuse at times, but you only have to check out the workshop to see how expansive it can be. However, the gameplay to my taste at least, still felt very underpolished and generally uninteresting to the point that I can't have a lot of hope it could ever be anything but outdated at best as of only one patch ago.

While I'm glad to hear that the devs are still working on it, the statement of calling it a 1.00 version as well as the specific avoidance of promises about what will or will not make it into the game still turn me off enough to wish I had put my money somewhere else, though I admit there's an outside chance I could reinstall on a whim in a year or two and be pleasantly surprised.

So to sum up, the shipbuilding aspect is very well done and I'd say it's probably a lot less confusing than it might seem at first if you just take a few minutes to adjust yourself. It might still be a little obtuse at times, but you only have to check out the workshop to see how expansive it can be. However, the gameplay to my taste at least, still felt very underpolished and generally uninteresting to the point that I can't have a lot of hope it could ever be anything but outdated at best as of only one patch ago.

If I've missed anything, please feel free to let me know so I can correct it."

The game is not what they promised (it's not even half of what they said and showed it would be). The random generated sandbox universes are great, but other than that, it's very empty and lacks a lot of depth. Looks like a failed attempt to make a mix between EVE online (only without online featues) and Freelancer gameplay. If I could ask for a refund, I would. This game is only worth it if it goes below 1€ during sales, and even so, I'm sure there will be a lot of much better games than this one for the same amount. So my advice is, don't waste your money on this.","Now that the game is no longer on ""Early access"" and there is an official final version, I can agree with many of the reviews here.

Pros 
+ The ability to design your own ship
+ Customizing the universe size and number of factions
+ Controls aren't overly complicated like many of it's space contemporaries

Cons
- The actual interface for designing your own ships is beyond complicated there is very little instruction.
- The tutorial is sub-par
- the ""Career"" mode seems like it is in it's infancy.
- To much time where you are doing nothing but waiting (3 or so minutes to mine out a single asteroid)

Update: After another 3 hours of messing with the ship designer, I figured out a few tricks to actually make the parts line up as a mirror image of eachother, but naturally, it is not how you'd think you'd be able to pull it off. Anyways made the ship, launched, got a mission message, and it was very vague.

Managed to mine the required materials, and now I have no idea where to take them...

Suggestion for the developer, go play Freelancer. Compare what you attempted to do with the 'freelance' mode of the game. get a mission, it tells you where to go, add a module, it shows what it does, how it affects everything.

The KV interface is crap. It's a nice idea, but there's too much of the wrong information, and not enough of the right information. Buttons get hidden, the touch location changes, little bugs, that are obnoxious. 

It's nice that it's an open sandbox, and you get to choose where you get to go and when you go there, but what's the point if the game expects you to guess where you're suppoed to go to?

     Gameplay: So you build a ship with a wide array of parts, from tiny to massive in scale. To accommodate nearly anything you can think of, within reason, there are limitations. The shipyard tutorial is annoying and persists every time you go into a new game, divided into chunks of whatever aspect you are using the shipyard. Instead of leading you step by step to build a ship, which would have been better as it is easy to miss some things. Leaving you to fumble around on your own, which has its uses of course. I personally feel that is the better way to learn is through trial and error, but can see when this would be annoying. On the whole however the shipyard is pretty good and the only real issue is the tutorial. Once you leave the shipyard however is the real issue, missions are bland and boring. Collect this, kill that, I was hoping for planetary sieges or space convoys. The faction system is pointless at this stage, I saw a rival faction that owned more systems give money to the only other faction that was clearly there rival as they were engaged in a open conflict. Clearly some issues need resolution here. 

	Gameplay: 2 of 5. 

     Graphics: Not terrible when the frame rate doesn’t stutter I’ll admit my system can’t run on ultra its true. But when it moves a high-medium for a while then slows to a crawl when more the five objects appear at once, not counting asteroids, ships and stations. Then Huston when have a problem. While textures look decent on some objects such as the lens flare from suns and ships. On planets they look half baked, while passable they could be better. And I’ve yet to find a nebula, so if they are even in here or not I don’t know but I’d hope they look better. In total the ships, asteroids and stations look good, fix the rest.

	Graphics: 2.5 of 5

     Sound: The music is catchy and epic but there’s only about three tracks so you’ll quickly grow board of them. Thrusters and gun fire is about the same sounds good on some weapons but again there’s only about a handful of sounds some that don’t match. Warp drive is nice though, loud boom followed by an annoying repetitive whir sound, that I swear sounds like one of mass effects loading screens.  On the whole they need to fix the ones they have and to add more sounds.

	Sound: 2 of 5

     Story: There isn’t one, I don’t know why I’m here, what I’m doing here or much of what’s going on…
I suppose this might be on purpose, I e Mine craft in space or other such build your own story. But I’d like some content please.

     Story: 1 of 5

     Replay ability: Ok so this is the only real thing holding Kinetic voids head above water. IF, and I strongly stress if, you can look pass the whole issues in the game sound, story gameplay. Then you can kill a lot of time here building ships and sailing amongst the stars, tweaking ships, etc.

     Gameplay: So you build a ship with a wide array of parts, from tiny to massive in scale. To accommodate nearly anything you can think of, within reason, there are limitations. The shipyard tutorial is annoying and persists every time you go into a new game, divided into chunks of whatever aspect you are using the shipyard. Instead of leading you step by step to build a ship, which would have been better as it is easy to miss some things. Leaving you to fumble around on your own, which has its uses of course. I personally feel that is the better way to learn is through trial and error, but can see when this would be annoying. On the whole however the shipyard is pretty good and the only real issue is the tutorial. Once you leave the shipyard however is the real issue, missions are bland and boring. Collect this, kill that, I was hoping for planetary sieges or space convoys. The faction system is pointless at this stage, I saw a rival faction that owned more systems give money to the only other faction that was clearly there rival as they were engaged in a open conflict. Clearly some issues need resolution here. 

	Gameplay: 2 of 5. 

     Graphics: Not terrible when the frame rate doesn’t stutter I’ll admit my system can’t run on ultra its true. But when it moves a high-medium for a while then slows to a crawl when more the five objects appear at once, not counting asteroids, ships and stations. Then Huston when have a problem. While textures look decent on some objects such as the lens flare from suns and ships. On planets they look half baked, while passable they could be better. And I’ve yet to find a nebula, so if they are even in here or not I don’t know but I’d hope they look better. In total the ships, asteroids and stations look good, fix the rest.

	Graphics: 2.5 of 5

     Sound: The music is catchy and epic but there’s only about three tracks so you’ll quickly grow board of them. Thrusters and gun fire is about the same sounds good on some weapons but again there’s only about a handful of sounds some that don’t match. Warp drive is nice though, loud boom followed by an annoying repetitive whir sound, that I swear sounds like one of mass effects loading screens.  On the whole they need to fix the ones they have and to add more sounds.

	Sound: 2 of 5

     Story: There isn’t one, I don’t know why I’m here, what I’m doing here or much of what’s going on…
I suppose this might be on purpose, I e Mine craft in space or other such build your own story. But I’d like some content please.

     Story: 1 of 5

     Replay ability: Ok so this is the only real thing holding Kinetic voids head above water. IF, and I strongly stress if, you can look pass the whole issues in the game sound, story gameplay. Then you can kill a lot of time here building ships and sailing amongst the stars, tweaking ships, etc.
Replay ability: 4 of 5

I don't have a whole lot of time put in this game but I can say that the game is worth the money.

<<WILL UPDATE AS GAME PROGRESSES!!>>

Pros:
--Customization: Create and command ships of your very making or download one of the many on the workshop and cause havoc. Also if you manipulate the game files you can have your created ships be specific to factions.
--Open Ended: Do what you want, when you want. No forced actions.
--Beautiful environment.
--Balanced Ships (Can't create an ultimate fighter with world destroying guns)
--ACTIVE DEV TEAM! these guys are great and are always making updates to the game. They will listen to the community.

Cons:
--Should've stayed in early access a little longer still a few bugs here and there, but then again what new release game nowadays doesn't?
--Kinda empty: for a sci-fi space sim it seems kinda empty.
--No tutorial.

In all the game has potential to be the best space sim out there but yes it still has some stuff needed.

Brilliant, not a single hint of help.

I think it's a good game, with customizable ship designs (size, shape, utility weapons, etc.), the addition of a few quests, and some trading that I find rather poorly done.

Pros:
Amazing ship builder
Fly and fight with your own personally customized ships
Load other players fantastic work from the workshop
Randomly generated galaxies
Large galaxies
Dynamic factions
Mining

Cons:
Linear fighting, no real depth to strategy or weapon specialization
Bad random events mechanics
Not much to do in general other than events, fighting and mining
No direct interaction with factions(other than fighting)

Right now the ""tutorial"" presents a firehose of useful information without any experience using that information interleaved. That means it goes in one ear and out the other.

A better way to hook beginners would be to rapidly show them a quick-and-easy barely useful build without going into every detail of that build.

Script an easy Skirmish and guide them through it. Guide subsequent repairs. Return to dock. Buy replacements, upgrade, etc. That is a true tutorial -- what exists now is more akin to a one-time hovering tooltip.


The graphics look good and the complexity revealed thus far hints at greatness. Unfortunately the time and rote memorization it takes to get initially acquainted with this game keeps me from truly playing it.

The ship building aspect is very entertaining and allows players to create whatever sort of ship they please, from small one-man fighters to giant hulking cruisers. Once out in space the game can get a little empty. There are missions to do which give you an immediate objective or you can go out and sort of do your own thing. There is mining for resources and diplomacy which allows you to go into a hostile system and hunt enemy ships for bounties. It can get a little old though. In my opinion, more diverse missions should be added as well as an option to select mission based on what kind of playstyle you have (maybe a mission interface at space stations?). This would allow players who want to play as a pirate to do raid missions, miners to do resource gathering, etc... I also think smaller stations should be implemented that do not have shipyards, but rather some sort of other funtions (ie. Smugglers' dens, military instalations, trade centers, etc?).  One more thing I would hope to see is more interaction with friendly faction ships, because as of now, friendlies just sort of drift around space and don't do much. I'd like to see something like, escort missions for friendly factions, or the possibility of hiring wingmen to fly around with you and assist in combat.

I think the game is deifitely on the right track, it IS a fun game as is but it still needs some work, I hope a DEV gets the chance to read this review and think about the suggestions I've made. I think implementing  some of them would make the game feel fuller once the fun of ship building wears out or you've run out of ship ideas.","I would definitely recommend Kinetic Void, however with a warning.

I've held off on reviewing it because I wanted to wait for it to be fully released. Overall, I'm not impressed. 

The ship creator is very fun, but gets boring rather quickly. 
The title is very apt as the space in this game is certainly a void with almost nothing to do besides the occational space battle or trade.
I played it for a while, then just got bored. I stopped playing the game entirely until the release of Steam Workshop support. The Workshop added a factor of being able to play other peoples ships. But again, after about five minutes of playing, it just gets boring again.
The developers add updates, but they don't really provide game changing mechanics. In fact, aside from the Workshop, the only true update visual on the surface is that the map is rendered in 3D instead of the original 2D. 
The graphics of the game aren't fantastic, the whole gam just looks, off. The post effects and the engines look nice though. The updates of the game have caused it to lag severely even on the lowest settings.

As much as I would love to recommend this game, the developers just don't seem to care about how their game as a whole runs.

2016 Update: Game is in stasis as the lead dev is now alone on the team and is looking for help to continue the project.

TLDR; game has one awesome ship builder and ship workshop collection that lets you pit your builds against other player made ships you add to the game (PvE, not PvP), but not much else in the way of features. It has given me over two hundred hours of playtime, which when compared to my playtime on bigger titles, makes me feel that it was still worth my money despite my disappointment that further development did not continue.

Warning #1: If building ships and then flying them is not your thing and you're looking for a more linear/on-rails type of game, then this is probably not your thing.

Warning #2: This is not a space dogfighting simulator or a replacement for Star Citizen.

Warning #3: This will let you build a great many types of ships and then fight in them. Don't expect much else. Due to the lack of other games that let you do this as extensively as KV does, I will still recommend this game despite many of the flaws. Edit: I have Starmade and my playtime on it versus this game should tell you what I prefer.

Warning #4: Get player made ships off the Workshop. Seriously. It is not modding per se but more an intended aspect of the game. Pit your designs against that of other players and all in all make the galaxy a much more varied and interesting place. :D

---

Disclaimer: I see a lot of bitterness from people who were following the game for a long time, so I should say that though I was following it, my own purchase was recent and I am free of any negative bias or expectation in that context. I was never a backer. My review should help new people looking for a different sort of space game experience.

---

The 'Build' here means the ability to build your own ships. As far as I know (so far) you can only build your own ship, not structures or anything else.

The 'Battle' is you against everything else. I have seen no sign of being able to have NPC allied ships under your control in a 'fleet' (so far).

The 'Explore' depends on how big you make the starting universe. However, it's only space travel. I don't believe there is any planet landing involved. Edit: However, you can enter the atmosphere of the planet and fly over the surface. Devs plan on bringing in working cities and such on the surface and possible even space to ground/ground to space exchange of fire. :-D

Early hours impressions: having a blast making ships! :D

Yet to actually leave the shipyard. WIll update as I play more~!

===

Update #1 (12/7/2014): I have left the shipyard and blown up my first space pirates. Hmmm, I think my ship's too strong.

Essential impression: This game is basically the developers providing you with the tools to start your adventure. How you want it to be will depend on you, it seems. For example, I made my ship too strong so wiped out enemies without feeling like I was in any danger. Unfortunately, it's impossible to assess what I can do to have a fun experience at this point. Work need to be done to give some cues to players to be able to intuitively assess how strong they are compared to enemies, etc.

There appears to be a lot more to this game, and I've barely begun to scratch the surface. Still would recommend at this point.

Update #1.5 (12/7/2014; later in the day): found strong enemies. Almost died. Fun fun. Seems the preparation a.k.a. building your ship is 95% of the fight. If I hadn't built my shape they way I had (out of pure dumb luck) I would've died. Me gusta...

Again, no real way to assess what can happen. You could say this is more realistic. :-P

Also, The missions just scroll and don't seem to be tracked per se. Not sure I'm a fan of this system. Seemed weak.

Seriously huge annoyance when you are trying to crawl within range of the station to dock in a big ship... Maybe I'm missing something? The 'Warp to within 10' doesn't always work... I often end up 50+ away when warping to a station.

Update 2.0 (2/10/2015): still playing this game. Like I have said before, this game gives you the tools to make your own pew pew experience. Highly recommend getting fellow-player made ships and populating the galaxies you generate. Just subscribing will do. Meeting and then fighting said ships will let you pit your design against that of other people. Getting the workshop ships is, imo, essential to enjoying this game, and isn't 'modding' in any way but intended.

Getting the workshop ships is, imo, essential to enjoying this game, and isn't 'modding' in any way but intended.

There was an annoying ship builder issue that got fixed real fast, so really glad for the support. :-)

[02/21/2015] - more bug fixes and improvements have come in. Some fo my previous annoyances have disappeared.

Not entirely stable on my machine for some reason, but this is the kind of game I am willing to play through a buggy experience and support (like the X games minus X Rebirth)."

Grundsätzlich funktioniert der Schiffbau wirklich gut auch wenn das Tutorial viel zu passiv ist so kann man nach etwa 20min. stupiden lesens die übrigen notwendigen fertigkeiten via Learning by Doing aneignen.
was mich so stört ist die Lieblosigkeit der Animationen, wie das sich das schiff beim direkten steuern überhaupt nicht neigt sondern wie ein Sterieler Aufkleber in der Bildschirm mitte feststekt und sich Ringrum alles dreht.
Die Menüs sind grausig unübersichtlich und das Verwenden von Systhemen und Waffen im Automatischen modus erfolgt absolut passiv ohne das man etwas dazu tut oder den zeitpunkt des einsatzes bestimmen könnte. Die Manuelle waffen steuerung kann man getrosst vergessen... man trifft Nie etwas! Von der Galaxi karte und zahlreichen UI und Overlay Bugs fange ich erst garnicht an...!
Ich muss mich leider den Übrigen Negativ komentaren Anschließen!
Dieses Spiel ist NICHT Fertig!","I think I've gathered enough impressions and experiences in both the alpha and the now ~finished~ version to say I'm VERY disappointed!
Basically, the shipbuilding works really well, even if the tutorial is far too passive. After about 20 minutes of mindless reading, you can acquire the other necessary skills through learning by doing.
What bothers me so much is the lack of love in the animations. The way the ship doesn't tilt at all when you steer it directly, but instead sticks in the middle of the screen like a sterile sticker, and everything around it spins.
The menus are horribly confusing, and using systems and weapons in automatic mode is completely passive, without you having to do anything or control the timing of their use. You can safely forget about manual weapon control... you never hit anything! I won't even get started on the galaxy map and the numerous UI and overlay bugs...!
Unfortunately, I have to agree with the other negative comments!

It's even worse now, as soon as i started a new creative sandbox game i'm greeted with a box that says ""we should not see this message"" with a button that you can't really click on (nothing happens). After pressing the x button in the corner of the message i'm greeted with the ship editor, except i have no parts, so i cant build any ships, which means the ship builder (-THE- only strong point of this game) does'nt work anymore. Furthermore i could not load my old ships (wanted to see if i could edit them).

If you plan on pushing the game out of early access to a full release atleast make sure your game works. Worst money spent ever. And by far the worst game i ever had the oppurtunity to try out. I don't care if i can or cannot get a refund, i'll try it anyway. Would rather see the company go bankrupt then see this game become complete.

Nope. This game does not get a seal of approval. They tried to sold us a great game with alot of diversity, yet all we got was a sandbox game with no real goal, hard to learn, no multiplayer, no progression... it just drift aimlessly in space.

The only thing that speaks for this game is the ship builder, and it aint that fancy. I'd rather just stick with Kerbal Space Program and play that game instead.","Updated - 2015-01-01

Well, this game is dead for sure now.
The dev simply abandoned the game and gave us a great and loud ""F*** YOU"" while run off with our money. People say that the dev don't even reply any kind of contact anymore.

Steam should be more responsible for letting this happen and give the money back to the clients. Afterall, they allowed this dev to sell their game while they had no capability or intention to keep working on the game.

Obviously, this will not happen because Steam doesn't reeeally cares about clients too, but at least they should took this example (saddly, not the only one here on Steam) and formulate a more tight policy to verify which dev can or cannot be sold here.

I know we are just clients, but a little bit of respect wouldn't hurt.","I have this game since the early access. The general idea is very interesting, but with tons of unfinished things, many bugs and so, i've waited for the early access stage to end.

Errors in the UI, for exampel the vendor menue the filters a weapons say EMP, Kinetic, Thermal... truth is, Beam, Projektile and Missile. 
Poor scaling of UI, you fight like Ace Combat... uh an red icon, klick, uh an red box around the icon and a red sircle and long bevor you can realy see the enemy it goes boom. You do have an targeing window that shows you a miniature of the enemy ship but i was unabel to detect any impact ov my weapon fire on the ship in the window seams that its yout an automatic generatet icon.
Beeing a trader is almost imposibel, mining takes for ever and mission reward dosn't scale. Reward for a mission in a fighter gave me 5-10k reward mission in a corvette gave the same.

The lift of things they have promised.

Let's take small look ^^
Fully detailed and customizable space ships.
Yes best part of the game, surpasses to my eye customisation in Space Empire and Galactic Civ.

Hundreds of weapons and modules of multiple sizes.
There are many but to get to hundreads you have to use the Borderlands equation. Existing modules times classes, here 5. Very few klass exclusiv moduls.

Fully customizable and adaptable controls for mouse, keyboard, and joystick.
Yes its there.

Huge procedurally generated galaxy, limited only by your computers capabilities.
No it isn't the max sice is 30 systems and 12 factions.

Randomized factions and political standings.
For the most part. 

Open world sandbox, you are in control of your fate.
Some one has to, the impulses from the world around do not exist. A chat mission every once in a while that tells you about a ""mission"" errand is no impulse.

Detailed economy simulation with resources, trade routes and more.
There are resources and you get chat messages that tell tales of lost shipment and impact on prices, but i never saw any ship docking at a station ore flying towards a gate for traderouts. The more part, thats the module trader at the station. BTW you can enter 50% of all stations... (there are only two kinds)

Epic space combat.
Epic means you get swarmd at a random mission by 5 exact copys of your own ship and get blastet out of the universe.

Toggleable Newtonian Flight
Thats there and dose work for the most part. Max speed is caped at two times your normal max speed.

Emergent gameplay.
Well Space is big and i taked forever to get somewhere and mining an asteroid is pretty boring in real life as well if you sit in your command chair and watch the pretty light from the laser.


So they realy more or less fullfilled the conditions on the list. To bad it'S not enough.

some further information to anyone looking at the release of kinetic void and thinking of DF9's... issues. yesterday I reported 3-4 issues on their threads, and within 6 hours two of them were resolved for the next patch, and now, 25 hours after reporting it, all the issues have been resolved for the next patch. So at the very least for now, this is not a double-fine 'Lets release the game and stop working on it' case. How it'll develop I cannot say, But the developers are clearly actively and responsively working on fixing the few issues it still has. 
in short, they have in no way released and abandoned this title."

Für den Anfang sind die wichtigsten Features enthalten um mit Schiffe zu spielen.

Handelssystem und Missionen sind auch für den Anfang schon mal nutzbar, benötigen aber noch mehr Verflechtung mit angekündigten Features. Planeten und Stationen sind schön anzusehen, aber benötigen noch Interaktivität.
Alles weitere wird sich hoffentlich in den nächsten Patches und Expansion ergeben.

Multiplayer, Playerstationen/-planeten und viele weitere Dinge aus den Vorankündigungen der Entwickler fehlen aber noch. Sodass ich mir bald ein rundes Spiel, ähnlich wie X-Universe vorstellen könnte!

Deshalb bin ich sehr gespannt wie es hiermit weitergeht. Das Potenzial ist da! Und für die Anfangszeit kann ich mich auch noch damit zufrieden geben – Schiffe zu bauen und Asteroiden abzubauen.","Since release V1.01, the game's potential has slowly become apparent.
For starters, the most important features for playing with ships are included.

The trading system and missions are also usable for the beginning, but need more integration with announced features. Planets and stations are nice to look at, but still need interactivity.
Everything else will hopefully emerge in the next patches and expansion.

Multiplayer, player stations/planetary, and many other features from the developers' advance announcements are still missing. So I could soon imagine a well-rounded game, similar to X-Universe!

That's why I'm very excited to see how this develops. The potential is there! And for the initial phase, I can be content with just building ships and mining asteroids."

Sadly, with it reaching its milestone v1.0 just a few days ago, I cannot in good faith recommend this game, for reasons I'll outline below.

First and foremost, this game still feels very, very unfinished. Going purely on the surface aesthetics, the visuals (which I remain a fan of) may be reasonable, but the interface remains a chore to interact with and there's something distinctly offputting about the cumbersome text windows used to introduce you to the game's mechanics. Overall, it's adequate. But that's all.

In terms of gameplay, Kinetic Void has changed in a few subtle but relatively significant steps since the early access builds of a month or two ago. The economy system seems to be in full drive, and the updates you receive regarding loss of cargo et cetera definitely maintain the connection between you and the big wide galaxy. In terms of the ship-to-ship combat, however, I find that even in its supposedly finished state the controls are unintuitive, with a host of keyboard bindings to memorise which, while I could get to grips with, might not be everyone's cup of tea. There's also nothing particularly inspiring about the combat- you lock on to a ship, then let your guns auto-fire on them until either you or they explode. You can try and manually fire your guns with the handy target-leading reticule now implemented, but it's still painfully monotonous and generally a wasted effort. That, and with the drastic reduction in flight speed that was implemented a while back, the game still plays very slowly and dogfights, which used to be relatively intense, are now relatively lacklustre.

Regarding other aspects of the game: the music remains the same as it's been since I first bought it, and is for the most part adequate. It's occasionally repetetive, and the game possesses no facility for contextual change, so combat will sound basically identical to drifting aimlessly through space. Of storyline there is essentially no sign, but then this was never supposed to be a story-driven game, so there's no discredit meant by that. What could have been a well thought out and richly populated universe, however, has been sacrificed for the sake of customisation.

This is indeed my problem with this game. Yes, you read that right. My main problem with Kinetic Void is the degree of customisation. Normally, I love games that include vast and excessively complex levels of customisation. What Kinetic Void offers, however, is a deceptively shallow amount of purely aesthetic customisation. Sure, you can build whatever shape ship you want and put whatever guns you want on it. But essentially, what do all those guns do? They're essentially reskins of the same gun, with different 'on-paper' stats. There's no distinct feel to it. As a game intended to be played more than once, Kinetic Void has little to involve the player and prompt different playthroughs. That lack of distinction is where I feel the game really falls down, and it's a problem I've seen with several games offering the same degree of customisation as Kinetic Void. The developers have clearly made a conscious effort to give the player a unique experience with plenty of options, and I respect that. But that breadth comes at the expense of depth. The universe of Kinetic Void is as harsh and barren as space itself, populated with empty, identical ships that maintain a visual pretense of being different. It's a very specific issue I have with the game, and I realise that many people might not feel the same way about it, but as someone whose expectations were built up significantly by the early-access hype, I cannot help but feel disappointed with how Kinetic Void has progressed.

On a positive note, the developers intend to continue adding features, meaning that there may be a little light at the end of the tunnel for us early-access buyers. For the most part, however, I feel that with significant overhaul now a recently dead prospect, Kinetic Void is and will always be simply an 'adequate' iteration of a dream that could have been great.","Having bought this in early access a while back, I saw a great potential in Kinetic Void that I hoped would someday be realised.

The main draw to this is obviously going to be ship building and customisation. 
There seems to be a fair number of parts to mix and match between and the editor, once you get used to it, is fairly intuitive. There are some bugs with the mirroring tool that desperately need to be worked out – at times the game will not recognise that the mirrored part is positioned in a perfectly valid location, despite registering the original component as being fine to put down. You can pretty much attach whatever you want to whatever you want. Go nuts – it’s not going to stop you. The basic shapes are generally quite blocky, but there’s enough manipulation to go around that you can, with a little innovation, make some interesting ships and they won’t look like a spruced up Minecraft creation. 

Combat, despite being a central focus of this game, isn’t particularly mind-blowing. It’s mid-way between EVE and X3. You won’t get straight up X3 style twitch-based dog-fighting, but you won’t be forced to watch your ship auto-pilot in circles which you hit hotkeys 1-9 to fire your missiles. It's a bit clunky but it works and there's some room for skill involved, alongside some tactical considerations to think about. 

There's an economy. Who knows how it works, but it does. And you start to realise how essential non-combatants are in a universe. Games like X3, Vegastrike, etc - you see so many random little shuttles and traders and civilian craft trundling around the universe from station to station. For the most part they aren't actually doing anything, but it's nice to have them there – they add a bit of flesh to the skeleton. In Kinetic void, you don't have that. There are only military grade ships. This is tied into, and probably because of, the way the game determines what class a ship is - procedurally based on various factors. But it also means that everything is flatly centred on combat. Feasibly you could populate the universe with your own cargo tugs and passenger shuttles and so on and so forth: but everything seems to be classed as a combat vessel, and so you don't want to run up against a fleet of unarmed cargo tugs that the AI has pulled out of the background because it thinks they're fighters. 

You can mine in this game and you can trade, but you are the only person mining in the entire universe, and you are the only actual trader in the universe. That makes it feel very lifeless, despite the fact that there are usually a fair number of ships flying around. The economy runs in the background, and events occur and things change it, but none of it happens in front of you. It doesn't appear to be as fleshed out as it should be. As far as I can tell there are two stations in the entire game: the ship station and the mining station. The mining station appears to be for visual effect only. You can't dock at it and it doesn't do anything. So you mine an steroid for about 5 different resources, trade them for credits at the all-in-one station, and upgrade your ship. There really doesn't appear to be an on-the-surface economy and that’s really disappointing because it’s only logical to conclude that you can’t actually affect the economy through the economy. If you can, you are the only one capable of doing it, when you should be just one more ship in the universe. Where are the other mining vessels drilling into asteroids? Where are the other scavengers going after scrapped vessels? Where are the merchants trying to make a profit from the uncertain wartime market? What are these resources going towards? Why do they exist? What do they build? Who knows. 

The universe needs more persistence. Enemies will show up in your sector, usually accompanied by mission markers, and you can run or fight. They'd be more of a threat if they could affect things if they could harass trade lanes, kill merchants, and affect the economy underlying the various wars that sprout up. Or if they just stayed in system after you've docked. Because they instantly de-spawn the minute you dock so the system gets reset to 0, which means that anything that looked like it could be interesting, could potentially produce emergent scenarios, etc.... well that's gone. This really needs to be fixed, because it undermines everything that a space sim should be about. 

You don’t feel like you’re immersed in the game – just skimming the surface of the under-lying calculations. Wars happen, sectors are taken, but there’s no apparent war. Someone desperately called me to this frontline battle. I expected to be way in over my head, but I thought it would be worth the view, so I jumped into the conflict. Nothing. Concerned that I had got the wrong system, I checked the map. Yep - active war zone designation. I was in a war zone without a shot being fired. The faction holding the zone lost, and were eradicated, but nobody saw them fighting an enemy. 

Planetary flight is fun to have. Not much more to say. 

Kinetic Void just doesn't feel like it has the depth that you expect from a space sim. It doesn't seem to know whether it wants to be a universe simulation or a combat simulation, and ends up in this strange space between. I honestly wouldn't say it's at 1.0 status. It feels like space sim lite. The ship building is good fun, the fact that your own ships start to populate the universe around you is brilliant. But the universe itself just doesn't feel very alive and that undermines the whole experience. 

The game will run on a potato: with everything turned down to very low it runs on a mid-2010 Macbook pro with 320M chipset at a decent clip and doesn't stutter much.","As of this write up I've played about 6 hours of Kinetic Void, according to Steam.

Feasibly you could populate the universe with your own cargo tugs and passenger shuttles and so on and so forth: but everything seems to be classed as a combat vessel, and so you don't want to run up against a fleet of unarmed cargo tugs that the AI has pulled out of the background because it thinks they're fighters. 

You can mine in this game and you can trade, but you are the only person mining in the entire universe, and you are the only actual trader in the universe. That makes it feel very lifeless, despite the fact that there are usually a fair number of ships flying around. The economy runs in the background, and events occur and things change it, but none of it happens in front of you. It doesn't appear to be as fleshed out as it should be. As far as I can tell there are two stations in the entire game: the ship station and the mining station. The mining station appears to be for visual effect only. You can't dock at it and it doesn't do anything. So you mine an steroid for about 5 different resources, trade them for credits at the all-in-one station, and upgrade your ship. There really doesn't appear to be an on-the-surface economy and that’s really disappointing because it’s only logical to conclude that you can’t actually affect the economy through the economy. If you can, you are the only one capable of doing it, when you should be just one more ship in the universe. Where are the other mining vessels drilling into asteroids? Where are the other scavengers going after scrapped vessels? Where are the merchants trying to make a profit from the uncertain wartime market? What are these resources going towards? Why do they exist? What do they build? Who knows. 

The universe needs more persistence. Enemies will show up in your sector, usually accompanied by mission markers, and you can run or fight. They'd be more of a threat if they could affect things if they could harass trade lanes, kill merchants, and affect the economy underlying the various wars that sprout up. Or if they just stayed in system after you've docked. Because they instantly de-spawn the minute you dock so the system gets reset to 0, which means that anything that looked like it could be interesting, could potentially produce emergent scenarios, etc.... well that's gone. This really needs to be fixed, because it undermines everything that a space sim should be about. 

You don’t feel like you’re immersed in the game – just skimming the surface of the under-lying calculations. Wars happen, sectors are taken, but there’s no apparent war. Someone desperately called me to this frontline battle. I expected to be way in over my head, but I thought it would be worth the view, so I jumped into the conflict. Nothing. Concerned that I had got the wrong system, I checked the map. Yep - active war zone designation. I was in a war zone without a shot being fired. The faction holding the zone lost, and were eradicated, but nobody saw them fighting an enemy. 

Planetary flight is fun to have. Not much more to say. 

Kinetic Void just doesn't feel like it has the depth that you expect from a space sim. It doesn't seem to know whether it wants to be a universe simulation or a combat simulation, and ends up in this strange space between. I honestly wouldn't say it's at 1.0 status. It feels like space sim lite. The ship building is good fun, the fact that your own ships start to populate the universe around you is brilliant. But the universe itself just doesn't feel very alive and that undermines the whole experience. 

The game will run on a potato: with everything turned down to very low it runs on a mid-2010 Macbook pro with 320M chipset at a decent clip and doesn't stutter much."

You can mine asteroids, salvage destroyed enemy ships, and fight enemy ships, follwed up by crashing into very badly textured planets, which you can't really do anything at, as of yet (I would think it might work as some sort of psuedo space station-asteroid that you could both mine and trade at, or whatever).

The developers developed the system to be overly complex, only to supply extremely minimal explenations. Experimenting is almost a must, just to get a complete handle of how to do stuff. At some points, I even found myself pressing every single key on my keyboard, just to see which button did what, as there were no other ways to finding out, until maybe recently.

 The space flight itself is incredibly boring, and you may as well be running around in your room, holding a car in your hand, squeeling ""Vroom!"" like a child- although only moving your ship at a snails pace. In otherwords, the ships handle with an unnecessarily complex system (which about half is redundant/useless), and fly like toys. 

The combat is not much better, depending on how you do it. 

Most of the time, you will be just sitting there, either blasting your lasers/rockets/whatever at the enemy, whittling down their shields, and then their hull. Then they go boom. Then you move on.

 Sometimes, the ships even crash into your own, absolutely obliterating you.

The best way to earn money is to just grind the asteroids away, and sell the ores you get at the stations. (which are now incredibly fucking hard to find, since they made only one every 2 lightyears spawn compared to the usual 10 or so in small groups you used to be able to find).

The only problem with selling is that you need to first take your ship's inventory, move everything into the station's inventory, and then go to the shop, click on your inventory, then click on the checkbox for your cargo, then the ore/water you collected, then finally.. sell them for a measily price of what might as well be 2 cents. 

This might be easier if it were in a better GUI, and the redundant stuff being removed. (EG shops being able to buy your stuff directly from ship inventory). 

The exploration aspect is ok, but bassically once you'd seen a single system, you'd seen them all.

the different faction ships are not really much different from the other faction's, even though the factions are random gen, which I understand- making randomly generated ships as well would probably be a bit too much for these devs. 

Regardless, there's no point in exploring, beyond trade (which combined with the slow-paced travel system = you tearing hair out).

I can NOT recommend Kinetic Void in its current state, as the ship controls are very difficult and elements like trading are neglected in my opinion. I could have thrown the €20 I paid out the window; then someone would have been happy and had a nice day. So I had a bad day because I regret buying the game.

Уже сейчас можно собирать себе корабль по вкусу и исследовать процедурно генерируемую вселенную, можно копать, можно не копать, летать над поаерхностью планет (пока бедненькой) без посадки, имеется  ОТКЛЮЧАЕМАЯ ньютонова физика, по-моему просто гениально реализованная, отключи щиты и согласно всем законам ты будешь ускоряться вплоть до бесконечности, включи и прощай инерция, но ты движешься с фиксированой скоростью и защищен от атак.
Пока в игре не стоит искать баланса, фактически это тех. демо и весьма впечатляющее, но все таки демо. 
Главное помнить, ранний доступ это то что позволяет нам - фанатам жанров, механик, старых серий игр миновать издателя, который запорол бы идею на корню просто потому что это не очередной Modern Warfare, это наш шанс дать идее превратиться в реальность, получить то что не выжило бы в условиях современной индустрии.. если бы не мы.
В заключение, если вы, как и я, любите X, Freelancer, Elite и прочие тайтлы что давали нам возможность объять необъятное, остаться со вселенной лицом к лицу, желаете увидев вдали жемчужину планеты, на черном бархате пустоты, полететь к ней и сесть в космодроме незнакомого города, и если вам там понравится, позвать друзей..
Это игра для вас, для нас. Я дал этой игре шанс воплотить мои мечты в сфере космических игр, может дадите и вы.","I've been waiting for a second Freelancer or X with multiplayer and the ability to build your own ships for a long time, if the developers don't miss the boat and release MP as separate DLC—this is a game for years to come.

Even now, you can build your own ship and explore the procedurally generated universe. You can mine or not, fly over the planetary surfaces (poor ones for now) without landing. There's SWITCHABLE Newtonian physics, which I think is simply brilliantly implemented. Turn off the shields, and according to all the laws, you'll accelerate to infinity. Turn them on, and goodbye to inertia, but you'll move at a fixed speed and be protected from attacks.
There's no need to look for balance in the game yet; it's essentially a tech demo, and a very impressive one at that, but still a demo.
The main thing to remember is that Early Access allows us—fans of genres, mechanics, and old series—to bypass a publisher that would have killed the idea at the outset simply because it's not another Modern Warfare. It's our chance to turn an idea into reality, to create something that wouldn't have survived in the modern industry if not for us.

In conclusion, if you, like me, love X, Freelancer, Elite, and other titles that gave us the opportunity to embrace the immensity, to be face-to-face with the universe, to see a distant pearl of a planet, on the black velvet of the void, to fly to it and land in the spaceport of an unfamiliar city, and if you like it, invite your friends...

Kinetic Void is a new genre of Spaceship Simulator. Having it's roots from the old freelancer and other games from the genre, it bring us new aspects of the game. Creating your own ship.

Kinetic void let the players create their own ships, the way they want. You are able to design and create the ships you want for any purpose that may suite you. Want a nice looking sleek ship? Go ahead and make one. Want a big though ship like the Galactica? Go Ahead. And when we talk about creating ship, the Devs have gone further then just looks. All of the ship needs, from the power to radars, to crew quarters are your to choice to decide where they go. And to protect these important systems is one of your goal. Having, technically, no limits, you can build any ship you would have though about. 

But creating ships is not the only aspect. If this is something that is not your taste, you can simply take some of the default ship, or why not download some designs from the community workshop? Having over  thousands of community created ships, there is a ship for everyone out there... If designing is not your taste. 

Kinetic void launches you in a Procedural Generation world where Factions of NPCs each struggling to survive and conquer the galaxy in their own own. You are sent in this sandbox word with one goal: Living your life how  you want it. You want to be a merchant, selling Goods around the universe? Go ahead. Want to be a smuggler and go past blockades? Want to just shoot at things and be a pirate? Or defend the innocent? All is yours to decide. 


Kinetic Void aims to  be one of the, if not the space sim with the most opened up world, with the most customized game possible and it does it in a way that makes  you wonder: Why no one though of this before? 


If you are a fan of any space ship simulator, Kinetic Void is a must. From it's amazing artwork, to the infinity of customization, to the hard work of the Team, there's absolutely no reason not to have this game.","This game is in Early Alpha stage.

Kinetic Void is a pretty decent looking space simulator with a lot of potential and a small but dedicated development team. I figure that the easiest way to review the game is to just list off a few of the more notable pros an cons as they are at the time of writing this review.

PROS:

-The game has a fairly robust ship creator/editor that allows you to make some really interesting and complex stuff if you sit down and practice a bit
-The player has a good amount of control over various aspects of both their ship and their way of spacefaring. Controls are fluid, weapons are responsive, and the game supports both keyboard and mouse control of the player's ship.
-It was interesting to learn that ship designs you save can potentially be used by NPCs, including enemies.
-The development team takes their time with updates, but is extremely consistent and dedicated in their work. New content might take a while, but I've never felt that the game has been abandoned by the devs like so many other early access titles.

CONS:

-Being early-access, there are still a number of bugs and other assorted issues to be ironed out. You're accepting that fact by purchasing the game in an incomplete state
-Space is almost realistically a bit too empty a lot of the time. I'd really like to see the number and variety of structures in each system increased
-Currently the variety of parts in the game is fairly large, but all parts are locked to one of five size classes, meaning that it can sometimes be difficult to make attractive ships, mainly smaller craft like fighters and interceptors.
-The game has little in the way of missions or goals. You're dropped in and expected to find your way around the vast expanse of space on your own. This will most likely be fixed later, but hey, that's life, you know?


Overall, I'd recommed this game to a friend if I knew that they were interested in a space sim that will eventually be very in-depth and detailed. Right now the game is still very lacking in features, but I have faith in the dev team to complete Kinetic Void, and the amount of content and bug fixes increases with every update.","Note that this review is written and submitted for a currently unfinished game(as of September 10th 2014), and that anything therein is subject to change.

This game is amazing. Hands down the most fun in a space game I've had in a long time.

What I like about it is the sheer massiveness of the things you can create and the massiveness of the galaxies you can explore.
I've also found out that you can create your own factions, and if you wanted to, delete the starters and make all custom ones that have their own unique ships and all.

Let's pray that these developers never live this embarrassment down - no group of coders who took advantage of hopeful fans so disgustingly should ever create games again. They released a massive list of planned features they intended to implement before suddenly (disregarding? ignoring? re-writing?) this list and passing their half-baked - no, too kind - utterly broken and pathetic project of a game as ""complete"" and then abandoning it after two or three further bug-fixing updates. ...which didn't even scratch the surface of what all was wrong with it. They took their money and split. Never in my life have I felt so horribly cheated, and it was only what, $20?

I couldn't sit and let my once-positive review sit and be seen by other poor folk... So, here it is, over a year later.

11966429,schinese,2014.08.03 15:17,✅,✅,0.5769702792,6,"我倒是没想到过也有一天能给抢先体验写评测。
咱一直对科幻，太空类游戏抱有好感，毕竟这一类游戏经常会和自由度这一重要要素相联系。不论是太空开飞机突突突的自由枪骑兵，或者是玩家在下一盘很大的棋的太空帝国，银河文明，到时间比较近的无尽空间，都会或多或少带有自由度这一要素。而其中跟太空关系最紧密的自由度体现点，要算是舰船的自定义了。
这个游戏便是建立在自主设计太空船的基础之上的一个游戏。就我现在这点游戏时间能够接触到的内容来看，舰船的自定义功能也算是有板有眼。话说在进行舰船自行设计的过程中，我倒是明显有感觉，舰船的设计方式的思路（是设计方式），或者说设计时的操作方式，有很多地方和坎巴拉太空计划很像，后者是自行设计航空航天器并将其发射升空的游戏，各位估计也知道。
另外，游戏说的是设计太空船，我要说，游戏诚不我欺，因为设计出的东西确确实实是笨重的太空船，操作不骗人系列。不管怎么压缩，体积也都摆在那里了，如果想设计个自由枪骑兵里的小型单人飞船，那是想多了（那玩意儿最多跟家园里的战机护航艇一个级别，这里则真的是战舰）。
基本除了设计飞船以外，要说游戏乐趣也就剩下在太空里到处跑做些[spoiler] 羞羞的事情 [/spoiler]能在其他游戏都很常见的事情了。那我是不是可以理解为，主角是飞船的模拟人生呢（笑
相比前段时间的太空工程师，玩家亲自扮演一个工程师来设计飞船，这个游戏则相当于是从更加宏观的角度让玩家设计飞船，所以相对的模块化的物品也就更大，换句话说，这个游戏更可以说是拼凑一个模型手办，模型手办用哪些手脚，玩家决定。而太空工程师，那就是玩家在玩一个太空版的MC了。因为售价，我于是很自然就把这两者拿来比较，当然，对于谁好谁坏这种问题是没有定论的。
这类想要强调自由度的游戏一般在画面等等其它方面会做得比较差，本游戏就是这样，画面说不得好，音乐算是一般，至少还是能体现出太空的感觉。。即使是考虑这是一个抢先体验游戏，但也能猜到，最终游戏的画面就算有改进，也会很有限。想想看无尽空间，在将舰船设计压缩为简单的“加buff”之后，换一个较好的画面，自由度方面的表现就会让人觉得诚意不足。[strike] 就算是家园2升级个子模块也知道改模型啊喂…… [/strike]所以玩这类游戏就要先抱有忽略画面的觉悟。
另一个所谓的弊病是对中文而言的，由于是太空题材游戏，英文肯定会相对其它英文游戏来说理解更有难度，想象看坎巴拉太空计划那一堆英文就明白了。我要说，其实就算是中文，对于没有接触过太空知识的玩家来说，坎巴拉也不一定能玩，那么多词如果中文都不知道意思怎么玩？只能是堆失败经验总结。而本游戏的英文难度相对坎巴拉来说低一点，但也能让人有些头大。因为除了词语意思难不难以外，文本量也是个让人头大的问题啊…………
最后，游戏打折75off入手表示不坏。","I never thought I'd get to review an Early Access game.
I've always had a fondness for sci-fi and space games, after all, they often rely on the crucial element of freedom. Whether it's the freelancers flying planes and shooting around in space, or the grand chess game of Space Empire and Galactic Civilization, or the more recent Endless Space, all of them incorporate this element of freedom to some degree. The most relevant manifestation of this freedom in space is ship customization.
This game is built around the concept of customizing your own spaceships. From what I've been able to play with so far, the ship customization features are quite well-organized. While designing my own ship, I felt a distinct resemblance between the design process (or rather, the design method), or the control methods involved in designing it, to Kerbal Space Program, a game where you design and launch your own spacecraft, as you're probably familiar with. Furthermore, the game talks about designing spaceships, and I have to say, the game doesn't lie, as the designs I get are indeed bulky spaceships, and the controls don't lie. No matter how you compress it, the size is there. If you're thinking of designing a small, single-person ship like in Free Lancer, you're overthinking it (those are at most on the same level as the fighter escort craft in Homeworld, while here you're actually a battleship).
Besides designing the ships, the fun of the game is basically just running around in space doing [spoiler] embarrassing things [/spoiler] that are common in other games. So, can I interpret this as the protagonist being a spaceship sim? (Laughs)

Compared to the recent Space Engineers, where players personally assumed the role of an engineer designing a spaceship, this game takes a more macro perspective, so the modularity of the items is relatively large. In other words, this game is more like piecing together a model figurine, with the player deciding which parts to use. Space Engineers, on the other hand, is like playing a space version of MC. Because of the price, I naturally compared the two. Of course, there's no definitive answer as to which is better.

Games that emphasize freedom generally fall short in other areas like graphics, and this game is a case in point. The graphics aren't great, and the music is average, but at least it manages to capture the feeling of space. Even considering this is an Early Access game, it's reasonable to assume that any improvements to the final game's graphics will be limited. Think of Endless Space: after compressing ship design into a simple ""add buff"" mode, replacing it with better graphics would make the freedom feel less than genuine. [strike] Even upgrading a submodule in Homeworld 2 requires changing the model... [/strike] So, when playing this kind of game, you have to be prepared to ignore the graphics.

Another so-called drawback is in the Chinese language. Since it's a space-themed game, the English is definitely more difficult to understand than other English-language games. Just imagine the overwhelming amount of English in Kerbal Space Program. I'd say, even in Chinese, Kerbal might not be playable for players without any prior space experience. How can you play without knowing the meaning of so many words in Chinese? You can only rely on experience gained from failures. While the English version of this game is a bit less difficult than Kerbal, it can still be a bit daunting. Besides the difficulty of the words, the sheer volume of text is also a major issue...

Finally, the 75% off discount on the game isn't bad."

I had to hard reset the machine. Hopefully I did not lose any data.

I'm going to deinstall it. If there's a chance to wipe it off my library without erasing this review I'll do that, too. If I would be able to click two thumbs down, or even three, I would.



Here's my initial comment from August:

====

For now this feels like pre-alpha software. Fiddling around with the editor is no fun for various reasons. (*)
And the download took ages, too. If this would not be early access I'd now like to have my money back.

(*)

P.S.: I'm running the game in 1280x1024 on a low end Mac. There's an issue detecting clicks on at least all of the editor's top menu line icons: Even though you point at them your clicks don't get recognized properly, despite the icons getting highlighted. Instead there's only a small, let's say 4 pixel tall, detection area at lower icon end where clicks get recognized, even though the actual icons are much taller and clicking that low kinda feels like clicking off icon already.

It's very cool. Overall, it's a very promising game, but it's still quite limited. The building mode isn't very user-friendly. Moving and mirroring are still a bit fiddly.

    - Notifies you of missions, auto-accepts them and thereby sends in bad guys to murderize you (as of D13, planned to change in the future)
    * Has built-in tutorial, but is not perticularly useful or userfriendly

Overall a good game, but still needs work; hence early access. If you are into space flight games and wish to build your own ships to shoot down your enemies, while looking absolutely beutiful at the same time, this is you're game.

EDIT: After letting it sit a while, most importantly after leaving early access, I feel like this game just does not live up to its potential. Unless the devs pick it up seriously again or give it to someone else, it will forever be a singleplayer sandbox of Elite:Dangerous with 60% of the features missing.
        I really want to love this game, but the lack of content (which would be ok with multiplayer) really kills it for me. If you are considering buying this game, don't. To the devs I ask only one thing, please, please, please finish this game as it deserves to be! You guys are letting a game with so much potential die and be ripped apart by a now-hostile community that is so ashamed by the fact this game was not finished.
        That being said I still like to just fly around in sandbox with a massive ship and blast everything out of everyone, but then I get bored and the economy is pointless in sandbox and quite frankly, with the limited information and lack of in-game tags of items to their economic counterparts, impenetrable and boring in career. I love the idea of a complex economic system, but there just isn't enough to do in it and the same with factions.
        Aside from missions, that rarely work, all you can do is not trade with a faction you don't like or blow up all their ships and not affect the trade of that faction as all ships (except yours) are military, with minimal cargo and minimal reward other than a tiny bit of rep from other factions, which does not give you lower prices or more hangar space (which is just taunting me in the station UI, waiting to be implemented along with the scaning system) or any other reward for that matter, making the only good way to get money reliably is to go mining, which takes a ridiculous period of time to mine one asteroid, which give maybe two good minerals at a time and dosn't sell for very much at all, maybe getting you enough to buy half of a hull segment on your already tiny mining ship, that must be built from the 'random parts' selection when creating the galaxy, as the Oberon Freighter has no mining laser (although it has a salvage, with not enough cargo space to hold any of the salvagable items) and the fighter (whose name escapes me) has barely enough firepower to get into a fight with a ship its own size, much less one of the ships that the AI controls with aimbot level skills (to be fair, your turrets have the same ability to aim with rediculous accuracy) and are almost all made of size three and up parts that dwarf your tiny starter ship.

However, there are some great videos on youtube, so if you watch just half of one of those you should get a good enough of a grasp to be able to figure out the rest. So once you have the controls down its just a matter of your imagination seeing how all of the ships are cutom built with various modules that can be stacked or layered so the possibilites are rather endless. Also it has a Workshop so its going to be Mod friendly, and you can already post up your ships and download your favorites. So not only do you get to build your own ship, paint your own ship, and arm your own ship, you can then go fly and fight in your own ship.

Pros: 
 ~ More intricate ship building: Less blocky designs, more artistic designs seem to be possible with this game.
 ~ More customization
 ~ Factions present, hostile and non-hostile.
 ~ Pretty good graphics, and runs very well. (Have not tested FPS with large ship builds yet, will do later.)
 ~ Vast space system.

Cons:
 ~ Guide and tutorial needs work. Bigger font size. Different color than the rest of the screen, make it big and bold etc, otherwise players are going to ignore it at first (like I did) and then kick themselves later for ignoring it. It took me 10 minutes to locate the information needed to simply apply Subsystems. If it takes that long for an average player to deduce that, interest will wane quickly.



Y'know, honestly... I was going to write a negative review...but while writing this piece I've had a chance to reflect upon the game itself. 

Right now it IS indeed worth the price. $20.00 USD for a Beta isn't too bad at all, especially given the wealth of content in game, not to mention the very awesome ship builder thing (once you get the hang of it).

For anyone thinking of buying this game.... be warned its not your garden variety Minecraft-esque Ship Building game. It takes some thought and a bit of patience to learn how to build a ship, how to make it fly etc etc. Its not easy, but it is rewarding once you've mastered how the game works.

На данный момент в наличии есть только годный конструктор кораблей (Если вы могли проводить часы в редакторе кораблей из ""galactic civilizations 2"" и хоть чуть-чуть знакомы с 3D Studio Max или другими редакторами 3D моделей, то вам точно понравится) и бескрайний, молчаливый космос. 

Я наткнулся в обсуждениях на тему от такого же нуба, как я сам, который просил рассказать - что же в этой игре вообще можно делать. И там был довольно ёмкий ответ от самого разработчика. 

Я попробую сейчас кратенько пересказать его слова в формате FAQ:

Q: Какая разница между режимами игры ""Creative"" и ""Career""?
A: Creative (творчество) - это режим, в котором у вас есть всё, чтобы сразу начать конструировать свой Дредноут Тёмного Властелина - при старте игры у вас уже имеется по 999 ВСЕХ деталей (корпус, пушки, подсистемы), которые на данный момент есть в игре. Более того - при каждой стыковке к любой станции количество всех деталей опять восстанавливается до трёх девяток. Твори - не хочу.
""Career"" (карьера) в свою очередь представляет собой симулятор выживания в безмолвном и холодном космосе. У вас есть стартовый корабль - юркий истребитель, неуклюжий транспортник или ""набор случайных модулей"", 10000 кредитов, от 10 до 50 звёздных систем для исследования и от 2 до 12 фракций (пока они лишь воюют друг с другом). 

Q: Как тут зарабатывают деньги?
A: На данный момент есть два способа - добыча полезных ископаемых из астероидов и лутание сбитых кораблей. Для этого надо поставить на турель добывающий лазер (mining laser), а затем ""атаковать"" им астеройд (не забудьте впихнуть в ваш корабль побольше ""cargo"" подсистем - будет куда сложить породу!). Есть также более сложный способ - заниматься добычей с помощью специальных дронов - mining drones. Но для этого понадобится ангар, несколько подсистем, катапульта для дронов и (внезапно!) дрон-добытчик(и). В карьере это будет стоить определённых денег. Правда в стартовом корабле ""Oberon freighter"" уже есть дрон и всё необходимое для его использования. Но выбор компонентов не слишком оптимизирован, так что вам будет что улучшить.
Ну и продать намайненное, естественно,можно на космических станциях. Сначала нужно выгрузить породу из корабля на склад, а затем продавать в местном магазине. 
\от себя\ - когда количество руды стало стабильно переваливать за сотню, пришлось юзать автокликер, так как разрабы не прикрутили кнопки ""продать всё из этой вкладки"" х) 

Что-бы обобрать остов очередного космического неудачника, требуется свой, особый лазер.

Да и вообще любой корабль под управлением игрока очень быстро превращается в дикобраза, выставившего иглы разнообразных орудий во все стороны.

Над миссиями сейчас упорно трудятся и обещают выпустить их в ближайшем будущем.
UP Кое-какие простенькие миссии уже появились и выдаются рандомно, когда игрок болтается в космосе.

Q: Как путешествовать между Звёздными системами?
A: Есть два способа. Первый - Звёздные врата. На карте галактики они отмечены белыми линиями. Вам нужно прилететь в ту точку, в которой эта линия начинается\заканчивается в вашей системе (как правило это станция) и отправиться на другой конец врат - на другую станцию, в другой системе.
Второй способ, как обычно, более нетривиален - понадобится подсистема ""Jump Drive"". 

Вот так, если вкратце. Оригинал (уже несколько устарел) - http://steamcommunity.com/app/227160/discussions/0/540744475485931024/

Так же есть гайд на Немецком и Английском языках ""первые шаги"" - http://steamcommunity.com//sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=271950254

Звуки и музыка приятные. В ранних версиях звук ""убивался"" по непонятной причине, но в сборке D14 эту проблему починили.

В целом потенциал у этой баймы очень высокий. Разрабы обещают запилить кооп, обучение и прочие ништяки.

Last change: 28.09.2014","What a magnificent story. Words simply cannot describe how epic it will be.

Currently, all we have is a decent ship designer (if you could spend hours in the ship editor from ""Galactic Civilizations 2"" and are even slightly familiar with 3D Studio Max or other 3D model editors, you'll definitely love it) and the vast, silent expanse of space.

I came across a thread in the discussions from a fellow noob like me, asking for clarification on what you can actually do in this game. And there was a pretty succinct answer from the developer himself.

I'll try to summarize his words in FAQ format:

Q: What's the difference between the ""Creative"" and ""Career"" game modes?
A: Creative is a mode where you have everything you need to start building your Dark Lord's Dreadnought right away. When you start the game, you already have 999 of ALL the parts (hull, guns, subsystems) currently in the game. Furthermore, each time you dock at any station, the number of all parts is restored to three nines. Create as much as you want.
""Career,"" on the other hand, is a survival simulator in the silent, cold reaches of space. You have a starter ship—a nimble fighter, a clumsy transport, or a ""set of random modules""—10,000 credits, 10 to 50 star systems to explore, and 2 to 12 factions (for now, they're just fighting each other).

Q: How do they make money here?
A: Currently, there are two ways: mining asteroids and looting downed ships. To do this, you need to equip a mining laser on a turret and then ""attack"" an asteroid with it (don't forget to pack your ship with plenty of ""cargo"" subsystems—you'll have plenty of room to store the minerals!). There's also a more complex method: mining with specialized drones. However, this requires a hangar, several subsystems, a drone catapult, and (surprise!) a mining drone(s). This will cost money in the quarry. The starting ship, the ""Oberon Freighter,"" already includes a drone and everything needed to use it. However, the component selection isn't very optimized, so you'll have room for improvement.
And, of course, you can sell your mined minerals at space stations. First, you need to unload the minerals from your ship into a warehouse, and then sell them at the local store.
\on my own\ - when the ore count began to consistently exceed a hundred, I had to use an autoclicker, since the developers didn't implement a ""sell everything from this tab"" button x)

To loot the wreck of yet another space loser, you need your own special laser.

And in general, any ship under the player's control very quickly turns into a porcupine, with its quills of various weapons pointed in all directions.

They're currently working hard on missions and promise to release them in the near future.
UP: Some simple missions have already appeared and are randomly generated when the player is out in space.

Q: How do I travel between star systems?
A: There are two ways. The first is through Stargates. They're marked with white lines on the galaxy map. You need to fly to the point where this line begins/ends in your system (usually a station) and travel to the other end of the gate—to another station, in another system.
The second method, as usual, is more complex—you'll need the ""Jump Drive"" subsystem.

That's it, in a nutshell. Original (already somewhat outdated) - http://steamcommunity.com/app/227160/discussions/0/540744475485931024/

There's also a ""First Steps"" guide in German and English - http://steamcommunity.com//sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=271950254

The sounds and music are pleasant. In earlier versions, the sound was ""killed"" for some unknown reason, but this issue was fixed in build D14.

Overall, this game has a lot of potential. The developers promise to add co-op, training, and other goodies.

Stay tuned (c)

Daher versuche ich nicht zu sehr auf Bugs und ähnliches einzugehen, sondern eher auf die Features selbst, die das Spiel bietet.

Wie oben gesagt ist das Spiel noch in der Alpha, daher werde ich nur kurz auf den Bau-Modus eingehen, den ""Dogfight"" (Kämpfen im Weltraum).

Ersteres ist nach lernen der Shortscuts sehr amüsant da bisher eine relativ große Anzahl an diversen Teilen zur Verfügung steht - für Alphastatus verkraftbar, allerdings für später noch etwas zu wenig, aber die Developer haben an dieser Stelle noch Zeit nachzubessern.
Der Dogfight ist derzeit noch etwas roh, und das merkt man an einigen Stellen - so habe ich es bisher noch nicht geschafft, mein Schiff auf ""Autofeuer"" einzustellen, sondern ziele mit der Hand - was im Vergleich zu der KI die Autofeuer besitzt und quasi immer trifft ein kleiner Nachteil ist.

Grundlegend ein sehr interessantes Konzept, besonders auch durch die Customization die man an seinem Schiff vornehmen kann, und die vollkommen offene Welt durch die man quasi Minecraft in Space hat.
Für den bisherigen Alphastatus kann ich das Spiel nur weiterempfehlen - unter anderem deswegen, weil es monatliche Updates gibt (in meinen Augen ein Kritikpunkt bei vielen anderen Spielen!), und immer wieder ""Hotfixes"" um nach und nach Bugs zu beseitigen.","First of all, it should be noted that ""Kinetic Void"" is a game in alpha.
Therefore, I'll try not to dwell too much on bugs and the like, but rather on the features the game offers.

As mentioned above, the game is still in alpha, so I'll only briefly discuss the build mode, ""Dogfight"" (combat in space).

The former is very entertaining after learning the shortcuts, as a relatively large number of various parts are available so far – manageable for alpha status, but still a bit too few for later, but the developers still have time to improve this.
The dogfight is currently a bit rough, and you can notice this in some places – for example, I haven't been able to set my ship to ""autofire"" yet, so I aim with my hand – which is a slight disadvantage compared to the AI, which has autofire and almost always hits.

Fundamentally, it's a very interesting concept, especially with the customization you can do with your ship and the completely open world, which is essentially Minecraft in space.
I can only recommend the game for its current alpha status – among other things because there are monthly updates (in my opinion, a criticism of many other games!) and constant ""hotfixes"" to gradually eliminate bugs."

Okay, how to improve.  First a tutorail on some basic controls (movement, weapon selection, and the like), building your ship and space combat.  Until these are ironed out I can not recomend this game."

This game has gone to a whole new level of epic with D14.2 just because of the fact that now i can basicly hover right over a planet, go as about 30 meters from the ground without being blowen up, but there are somethings that could be impermented to make this game better, first off, landing gears, to land on a planet, second, just maybe, add someway of exploring a planet, with a vehicle or running around on the planets. there are alot of things that could be added, but those twos where the first things that came to mind.

Ah, Kinetic Void. What can I say about this beauty? For starters, the ship building is easy to use an monumentally powerful. While I have encountered some games that give you about 20 pieces and 20 spots to put them, Kinetic Void's ship builder truly lets you build whatever you want. If you don't like using the node system to place pieces, there is a freehand mode that lets you put anything anywhere. There are tons of pieces and all are resizable. On the largest setting, the pieces are insanely massive, and the more creative will find many pieces to build full size replicas of some of sci-fi's most famous ships. But this game isn't just space ship builder simulator. It has an incredibly well made space exploration portion. The ships to show their size quite well, as maneuvering a giant capital ship take much longer than a small agile fighter. There are tons of weapons of different damages and types and there are also preset ships for new players to use. In conclusion, Kinetic Void is an absolute masterpiece and I cannot reccomend it more.","EDIT: Just wanted to come back 6 years later and say that the game is dead with no further development continuing.

As of todays patch I will be loading it up again to see the progress.  The newest patch made me reread some of the discussions and reviews, just to see the team be concerned over positive and negative reviews as they are, and the way they phrase the responses has led me to admire and respect them.

So far, it seems to have a solid menu system, and I love and hope that they try to make a little more sense of the icons, numbers, subsystems and such, because it wasn't all clear as to what they did, or meant, or how they affected the ship.

So, after a few minutes of confused silence, I decided to choose one of the pre-made ships, and set off on my journey through space.

I had fun. The distances were ridiculous, and the slip-space mechanic was a bit underdeveloped, but hey, it's a still-in-progress. What do you expect?

Then I went into the fighting mode, in which I was destroyed in seconds, and had a good laugh at how horrible I was at simulators, and confused as to how exactly the weapons functioned. Once they did fire at the enemies, however, their power was surprisingly underwhelming.

I see a lot of promise in this recently-aquired game, though I've barely tapped into its' evidently deep wells of entertainment.

Много разных  вариантов как посстроить твой корабль. Если вы играли в KSP то вам не надо даже будет обьяснять как игра работает. Но в целом идея мне очень нравиться. Со скидкой в 50% можно взять.

- На рынке уже есть игры такого плана
- Похоже на копию KSP

ВСЁ 
Спасибо за внимание!","I bought it today and played a little. I'll give you a quick overview: it's a parody of KSP (Kerbal Space Program), but there are no physics. You can make your ship completely disproportionate and it will fly. But I'm a big fan of these types of games. There are so many different ways to build your ship. If you've played KSP, you don't even need an explanation of how the game works. But overall, I really like the idea. You can get it with a 50% discount. But if you have money, I'd recommend Space Engineers; it's a similar game, but overall better. It's up to you whether to shave or not.
Pros
+ Good variety of parts
+ Decent graphics
+ Ships are well-drawn
+ You can choose between different tactical options for each ship part
Cons
- No physics
- There are already games of this type on the market
- ​​Looks like a copy of KSP

THAT'S IT
Thank you for your attention!"

It is still in development, however, and is lacking some important features. Right now, I'd still rather play X3... or even X Rebirth. But that is not to say that game has no future. How will it compare with Star Citizen? Well I think it might be able to top the single-player sandbox experience (given Star Citizen will be an instanced MMO), but the game feels a little arcady at present, and don't get me started on joystick support.

I'd recomment this game merely for trying out the ship building and galaxy generation features, but I wouldn't call its gameplay enticing just yet.

This review used to be a thumbs up as it showed a ton of promise and the Early Access was fun, But alas the Dev's walked away. So Kinetic Void shall stay an unfinished project which could of been something fun. Do not buy this, There are better games similar to this that are actually finished or have a Dev Team commited to completing the Early Access of their game.


Original Review which was based on the Dev Team actually not giving up;

Kinetic Void - I originally bought KV for the ship building as I just enjoy playing Lego star ship building. Alas at the time I bought KV actually flying the ship was not that good, But!!........

 (EDIT 5th August 2014 : Dev Build 14 ship control is quite good, totally enjoying flying  my crazy designs)

Things have changed for the better as patches came along. Now its fun to get your creation made and out into the galaxy, Combat has come a long way since release, and I myself find it fun whilst I fly my ship and bombard the unsuspecting with my weapons. Oh and Combat drones actually do their job, nothing like seeing a wing of my drones attacking the enemies along with my ships weapon systems.

Building your ship, at times looks tedious. But its actually quite fun and simple once you understand its mechanics. There is a snap to grid type of mode and freehand mode for fine tuning a module of your ship for that certain look. I can literally spend all my time building a ship save it and begin another as I find it a ton of fun - It is my personal starship lego in my pc - Just a big kid at heart I think.

Mining has also came quite a long way, drone now mine the asteroids etc, harvesting ores for selling (A lot more to come I am sure on mining, buts its off to a good start)

Updates/patches come fast (I have noticed most Mondays there is an update) which shows the team dedication to KV. Some of the latest updates included some nice new backgrounds for the galaxies (Which I found to be excellent)

Dev support is quite good, I think this is one place where any game company (AAA or Indie) can excel or die from. Thankfully KV's team is quite good at letting the game players upto date on things coming and patch information. I myself have posted a comment or two and have had the Dev Team reply auite quickly on the topics  (This is something I look for in an Indie Team/Alpha release games - A+ guys/gals)

KV is still very alpha and most of us by now know what ""alpha"" means and if your unsure maybe wait a little longer, but I have not been disappointed with my purchase. KV has a long way to go with what is planned, but I think its going to be a fun ride as KV progresses into a full release.

I own pretty much every space game from Elite on C64 to the latest flop by a AAA developer, and all I can say is:

KV is another space game that I am happy to of added to my list of games I play each time I log into Steam.

If space games are your genre, I recommend adding this Indie title to you collection, for the price you will get your moneys worth out of it indeed!!!!","EDIT 13th Jan 2018:

I'm satisfied; building ships is fun...a bit of flying around, and that's it. Anyone who's ever played SPORE and spent a while building knows what I mean :).
Graphics are good, this game has potential. The developers are releasing updates, and for beginners, there are tutorial videos that explain a few things. I always find it strange that some people rate a title negatively because they still expect a full-fledged game despite the ""Early Access"" notice.
So, here it is again: This game is far from finished. There are bugs, crashes can occur, and the full range of functions isn't available!!

in ""story mode"" it may just be me but flying around with that i was able to scrap together with what i started with was ok but working out how to make more money to upgrade said ship was beoynd me, not sure if there is away yet, but if there is its not obviouse, i blew up a few ships thining it was maybe on like a bounty system but no. and kills dont drop anything either so i left that and when back to just creative mode.

the only other thing i have to say thats negitive about it is the bug with faster speed, you are able to drop your kinetic barrier  (sheild) to gain more speed to move about faster, for me anything over a class 1 ship just droped my fraime rate to about 1fps. my rig is not small either, even when i droped all settings to very low it was the same i hope this is fixed later in a patch i know the devs seem to read the reviews as i saw alot of replies on the ones i read.

but to sum it up this game is very good if you enjoy deigning things. there is alot of potential for this to expand into a great sandbox builder. is it worth buying this early, personally yes if you liek to build things like i do, but if your looking for the roam around and kill stuff experience i would wait a little longer, altho saying that the more support they have early the faster things get done :) your choice, but it is a fun builder :)","i have played this now for a few hours and as for as the ship building side of things go its a great game, sadly at this level of development thats all it is, i spent 2 hours building a capital class ship with massive firepower and was looking forward to testing it when i undocked and went to look around after 45 mins of flying around all i found was a single fighter. not much of a match, or a test.

but to sum it up this game is very good if you enjoy deigning things. there is alot of potential for this to expand into a great sandbox builder. is it worth buying this early, personally yes if you liek to build things like i do, but if your looking for the roam around and kill stuff experience i would wait a little longer, altho saying that the more support they have early the faster things get done :) your choice, but it is a fun builder :)"

At this point in time KV is very much an early alpha - if it is even that. Consider waiting on a more finished version, unless you are a big fan of custom ship building and have little interest in actually using the ship in question.

Even the ship building itself is at this time incomplete. There is only one type of weaponry and many other critical features are still missing. The rate of update/patch progress is extremely slow.

From my point of view as a gamer, avoid KV for now, but keep an eye on it.

Since a number of people were asking me to re-review the game in its current state, I finally relented and decided to try the game again.  These are my thoughts.  

I find that many improvements have indeed been made.  This is to be expected, and very much welcomed.  I find that many of the features such as the shipyard and flight models have been improved with more easy-to-use controls and additional features.  A quick rundown of some of the key features and improvements I noticed:
* Better inter/intra-system navigation and map
* Slightly improved combat gameplay
* Improved flight model and warp systems
* Missions, Cargo, and semi-functional stores
* Semi-functional ""career"" mode.  More on this below.

Some things that are still issues:
* Not developer's fault, but many workshop ships no longer function out-of-the-box due to creators failing to update them for new patches.
* Overall, game still feels quite clunky and difficult to use.  Somewhat high learning curve unless you're wiling to read a lot.  
>> Documentation has been improved.  Just be prepared for lots of reading.  
* Crash to desktop is common.  Crashes more as your ship's # of modules increase
>> Relatively decent auto-save means you won't loose too much progress.
* See more below

The game is still quite confusing and you often still don't even know what's going on.  There's still a lot left to be desired I think.

Overall, the game has improved. Though I can't say that this is something to get especially excited about.  ""Why are you being such a debbie downer"" you ask?  Well, it's an alpha.  It is SUPPOSED to improve.  If it didn't, it's not worthy of even being sold.  

I still do not recommend this game.  There is a ""But"" however... Here are my thoughts

Many critical features have been added and improved to a more usable state.  The warp mechanism has been tremendously improved.  The shipyard build system also deserves a mention as a vast improvement.  More customizability and more controls to fine tune your construction.  Though this can make things a bit more confusing to the new person or returning player, as with some of the other expanded features.  This is made up for with the improved documentation.  But beware, decent amounts of reading is required.  There are also some tweaks and improvements to the combat system.  It makes more sense but can still be awkward.  The galaxy map has also gotten a big makeover and is MUCH easier to understand.  

There are many things that still are confusing and unfinished in this game.  The ""career"" mode is clearly unfinished and requires more attention.  From what I can tell, it's a misleadingly named ""survival"" mode at the moment.  However, it fails at that as well.  You have credits and the idea is to earn more through cargo or more ""illigitimate"" means. Basically, you start out by picking ANY ship from the workshop or stock selections.  No cost.  If you run out of money buying cargo to load into your mega-freighter you downloaded and didn't have to pay for, then just select any of the ship-part categories and sell any number of the ""999"" parts you somehow own from the start.  Just sell a couple Tier 5 weapons or ship bridges and you immediately have so much cash that the display has to use exponential notation (e.g. 1,000,000^E10).   

Verdict:  Not recommended.  The game is still definitely unfinished.  There is not much polish. While there are a number of great improvements, I still cannot justify this game as a purchase.  It's confusing for new/returning players unless you're a quick learner or wanna read all the documentation.  Without developer input, I estimate this game is less than 50% done; though considerably more than the 6% quoted by the dev around the time of my original review 7 months ago.  

My point still stands.  Do not buy the game unless you want to support the developer or really like the idea this game stands for.  It is playable now, so if you just really wanna get into space and do things, then go for it. I recommend waiting until a sale, however.  It is not worth $19.99 to me.  If it had a price-tag of about $10, it may be a good price if you're willing to put up with the downsides of a relatively mid-level-alpha.

ORIGINAL 1/15/2014
I don't recommend this game.  Yet.  If the features they have planned for this game come to pass, then this game will definitely be worth its price.   For now, I'd only recommend getting this on a Steam sale. This is a VERY early access with only a few of the main features added.  The building and customization functionality does have a lot going for it and has a lot of potential.  The rest of the game is still somewhat confusing, clunky, and still very clearly unfinished.

My advice?  Wait a while.  Or buy this game simply to support development of the game.  Buying it to play it may end you up with some serious disappointment.  Don't get me wrong though, as I said, this game has potential.  As the developer stated in another negative review, this game is only approximately 6% finished.  Do not expect much from it.","UPDATED 7/8/2014
Since a number of people were asking me to re-review the game in its current state, I finally relented and decided to try the game again.  These are my thoughts.  

I find that many improvements have indeed been made.  This is to be expected, and very much welcomed.  I find that many of the features such as the shipyard and flight models have been improved with more easy-to-use controls and additional features.  A quick rundown of some of the key features and improvements I noticed:
* Better inter/intra-system navigation and map
* Slightly improved combat gameplay
* Improved flight model and warp systems
* Missions, Cargo, and semi-functional stores
* Semi-functional ""career"" mode.  More on this below.

Some things that are still issues:
* Not developer's fault, but many workshop ships no longer function out-of-the-box due to creators failing to update them for new patches.
* Overall, game still feels quite clunky and difficult to use.  Somewhat high learning curve unless you're wiling to read a lot.  
>> Documentation has been improved.  Just be prepared for lots of reading.  
* Crash to desktop is common.  Crashes more as your ship's # of modules increase
>> Relatively decent auto-save means you won't loose too much progress.
* See more below

The game is still quite confusing and you often still don't even know what's going on.  There's still a lot left to be desired I think.

Overall, the game has improved. Though I can't say that this is something to get especially excited about.  ""Why are you being such a debbie downer"" you ask?  Well, it's an alpha.  It is SUPPOSED to improve.  If it didn't, it's not worthy of even being sold.  

I still do not recommend this game.  There is a ""But"" however... Here are my thoughts

Many critical features have been added and improved to a more usable state.  The warp mechanism has been tremendously improved.  The shipyard build system also deserves a mention as a vast improvement.  More customizability and more controls to fine tune your construction.  Though this can make things a bit more confusing to the new person or returning player, as with some of the other expanded features.  This is made up for with the improved documentation.  But beware, decent amounts of reading is required.  There are also some tweaks and improvements to the combat system.  It makes more sense but can still be awkward.  The galaxy map has also gotten a big makeover and is MUCH easier to understand.  

There are many things that still are confusing and unfinished in this game.  The ""career"" mode is clearly unfinished and requires more attention.  From what I can tell, it's a misleadingly named ""survival"" mode at the moment.  However, it fails at that as well.  You have credits and the idea is to earn more through cargo or more ""illigitimate"" means. Basically, you start out by picking ANY ship from the workshop or stock selections.  No cost.  If you run out of money buying cargo to load into your mega-freighter you downloaded and didn't have to pay for, then just select any of the ship-part categories and sell any number of the ""999"" parts you somehow own from the start.  Just sell a couple Tier 5 weapons or ship bridges and you immediately have so much cash that the display has to use exponential notation (e.g. 1,000,000^E10).   

Verdict:  Not recommended.  The game is still definitely unfinished.  There is not much polish. While there are a number of great improvements, I still cannot justify this game as a purchase.  It's confusing for new/returning players unless you're a quick learner or wanna read all the documentation.  Without developer input, I estimate this game is less than 50% done; though considerably more than the 6% quoted by the dev around the time of my original review 7 months ago.  

My point still stands.  Do not buy the game unless you want to support the developer or really like the idea this game stands for.  It is playable now, so if you just really wanna get into space and do things, then go for it. I recommend waiting until a sale, however.  It is not worth $19.99 to me.  If it had a price-tag of about $10, it may be a good price if you're willing to put up with the downsides of a relatively mid-level-alpha.

The ugly:
   This game is utterly lacking in polish.

This game has a ship design system very akin to that used in Galactic Civilizations 2 which should be counted as a good thing.  The amount of customization that is offered to players in the design of their ships is a welcome sight as it’s something I have seen lacking in several games with the same feature.  From building the fastest fighter to the most looming dreadnought the experience of testing out different parts and experimenting with style is a great joy.

Players are allowed to name their galaxy and select how many sectors and factions exist within, giving them some level of control of the environment that they start off with.  There is plenty of room for expansion in this area of the game’s development as further options in creating the play environment would add to the overall experience.

The combat system is decent but could use some work.  While offering a manual mode of firing your ships weapons, there is a means of auto fire via the lock on, and pressing the assigned weapons group number.  In this early build I recommend avoiding the use of the auto fire as my weapons seemed resistant to firing let alone hitting.  However due warning, there does not appear to be any form of aim assist for now, and larger ships will have issues contending with smaller vessels you just cannot seem to hit.  (I am sure that these features will be ironed out in the future)

Other than that there really isn’t that much left to do within the game, yet currently you can see the foundations for what have the potential to be engaging and immersive systems.  

I full heartedly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys building ships from the ground up and actually being able to use them, as well as to anyone who enjoys space simulation games.  For what this game could be twenty dollars is a fair investment into seeing the developers get the chance to finish this game.  Yet to be fair it should be mentioned that in its current state Kinetic Void is arguably worth its asking price, while I love building ships and taking them for a spin there is just not enough to do currently.  With the occasional frame rate issue and bugs, for those on a budget or those who are not willing to drop twenty dollars on an incomplete game I would still recommend getting this game but when it is on sale.  This way you can still support the game, get a great ship builder, and access to what has the potential to be a great game.

The combat system is decent but could use some work.  While offering a manual mode of firing your ships weapons, there is a means of auto fire via the lock on, and pressing the assigned weapons group number.  In this early build I recommend avoiding the use of the auto fire as my weapons seemed resistant to firing let alone hitting.  However due warning, there does not appear to be any form of aim assist for now, and larger ships will have issues contending with smaller vessels you just cannot seem to hit.  (I am sure that these features will be ironed out in the future)

Other than that there really isn’t that much left to do within the game, yet currently you can see the foundations for what have the potential to be engaging and immersive systems.  

I full heartedly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys building ships from the ground up and actually being able to use them, as well as to anyone who enjoys space simulation games.  For what this game could be twenty dollars is a fair investment into seeing the developers get the chance to finish this game.  Yet to be fair it should be mentioned that in its current state Kinetic Void is arguably worth its asking price, while I love building ships and taking them for a spin there is just not enough to do currently.  With the occasional frame rate issue and bugs, for those on a budget or those who are not willing to drop twenty dollars on an incomplete game I would still recommend getting this game but when it is on sale.  This way you can still support the game, get a great ship builder, and access to what has the potential to be a great game.

On ne peu presque rien faire dans l'espace car pour passer d'une planette a l'autre il faut compter au moin une heur.
Himage du jeux un peu trompeur...
Au final c'est plus un jeux de légo ou on peut ensuite le metre dans l'espace...
les combats... il y a le tir auto ou le tir manuelle qui est pas trop mal mais l'IA est un peu conne... elle tourne en orbite autoure de notre vesseau en nous tirent deçue puis des foix elle se crash toute seul sur notre vesseau tel un moustique...
On ne peut pas aller sur les planettes, on se crash deçue, même pas d'animation, d'explosion... juste un retour dans notre menu.
Breff, si vous voulez un shipbuilder, il est bien mais il est tres limité mais c'est pas trop un jeux d'action.
","No multiplayer, even though it was initially stated that there was one.
You can hardly do anything in space because moving from one planet to another takes at least an hour.
The image of the game is a bit misleading...
In the end, it's more of a Lego game where you can then put it in space...
The combat... there's auto-shooting or manual shooting, which isn't too bad, but the AI ​​is a bit stupid... it orbits our ship, shooting at us, disappointingly, and sometimes it crashes into our ship like a mosquito...
You can't go to the planets; you crash, disappointed, there's no animation, no explosion... just a return to your menu.
In short, if you want a shipbuilder, it's good, but it's very limited, but it's not really an action game."

it is much easier to install parts into your creations and build ships. though certain things are seperated out so if you want to install armor onto ALL your turrets you have to select them all individually same with your engines

 once you get into open space my framrate doesnt tank as badly as it once did. now it only tanks when im being swarmed by enemies and my turrets attempt to lock onto them. also framerate tanks whenever i open the map screen which is weird.

the building is first rate but the combat is based upon a turret system so if you want to actually control the weapons you have to press an auxilary button to fire them yourself. otherwise all the weapons feel really piss weak with no noticible difference between the large and small weapons in terms of damage though the smaller ones usually fire faster. the automated targeting with the weapons is rather slow and you can find your systems overloaded if you mark to many targets at once. even then i have had times when i have marked just one target and though its still within range they wont actually fire at the enemies.

can i recommend it now. on gameplay no. the menus have gotten better so i can recommend the game on that.","alright im redoing this review because there was an update recently that fixed some of the issues with the game. the game performs much better now and the interface has also improved.

Game as far as construction of ships is far more functional than when I first got the game if not buggy and great strides have been made in this area to make it approachable. However once you get into the game itself the fundimental problems with the game shine through again.  

Kinetic Void tries to reinvent the space sim wheel by making it square.  Controls are overly complicated for flight and space feels empty. Both of these problems have been solved by games made over a decade ago like Freelancer. Mouse flight needs to be implemented better. Warp gates need to be added to define sections of space. Weapons need to feel more powerful and stand out more. Procedural galaxies need to be dropped and replaced with a designed galaxy unless they can make them interesting which they currently are not. I could go on and on about how this game ignores problems that have been solved by older, better games.

My suggestion... save your money. Early Access games either have good bones that need to be fleshed out or they're like Kinetic Void where all they have is a good idea but no idea how to impliment it into a good game.

I have watched this game grow (and continue to do so) since July 2013 and am pleased by the progress that the developers have made so far, but there is still much work to be done in order to refine Kinetic Void. I would recommend this game to the following types of gamers:

-Gamers who enjoy being creative in taking parts and building something of their own, but poses the patience to have to tweak, rework, or even recreate what they make after major patches come out. This game is still early access so it is understandable that these things happen and the patches generally make things easier.

-People who enjoy a good RPG type simulation that takes place with ships, factions, and fleets, and can spend hours upon hours of trial and error to find out what works best in this game.
 
-People who have ever played Battlestar Galactica Online: the game has a similar feeling to it and I feel that people who enjoyed that MMO would feel right at home with Kinetic Void outside of the ship creation menu

-Peoplewho have played and enjoyed Kerbal Space Program: If you enjoyed the building mechanics in Kerbal, expect to enjoy Kinetic Void

-People with a lot of patience in general who can wait for something to blossom to its true potential.

I won’t lie, this game still has a lot of bugs (some are actually quite comical) but the Developers have done a good balance of both fixing these bugs as they come up and adding new content to the game, and I hope they continue to do so.","I would recommend this game for most people, but not everyone. I have watched this game grow (and continue to do so) since July 2013 and am pleased by the progress that the developers have made so far, but there is still much work to be done in order to refine Kinetic Void. I would recommend this game to the following types of gamers:

-Gamers who enjoy being creative in taking parts and building something of their own, but poses the patience to have to tweak, rework, or even recreate what they make after major patches come out. This game is still early access so it is understandable that these things happen and the patches generally make things easier.

-People who enjoy a good RPG type simulation that takes place with ships, factions, and fleets, and can spend hours upon hours of trial and error to find out what works best in this game.
 
-People who have ever played Battlestar Galactica Online: the game has a similar feeling to it and I feel that people who enjoyed that MMO would feel right at home with Kinetic Void outside of the ship creation menu

-Peoplewho have played and enjoyed Kerbal Space Program: If you enjoyed the building mechanics in Kerbal, expect to enjoy Kinetic Void

-People with a lot of patience in general who can wait for something to blossom to its true potential.
