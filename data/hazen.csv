Sadly, after advancing in the game, it begins to crash to desktop in a couple minutes or whenever you try to save the game.

Unplayable for me as it is.


--------------------- WHAT FOLLOWS DOESNT APPLY ANYMORE: old, 2022
I positively *loved* this game. 
Finished it with a happy smile and will always remember it fondly, play it again sometime.

Now, the not so fine disclosures and caveats: 
1- From Pineville on, some saves can fail to load, *as least for me*, making me load an older save, and try to not quit the game till I arrived at a new place via teleport.

Thanks the heaven I *always* backup the saves (when the game keeps only one) of all my games regularly as I play.

So in a failure to load I just past over the last save I kept.
C:\Users\your user name\Documents\Hazen\Profiles\you player name\saves.

2- Being 67 y.o. and somewhat slow now, I hacked it to death. 

As you can't use Cheat Engine (alt tab crashes the game), I use free HxD hex editor to look over the savegames in Documents, Hazen ... Save ... (Example, Darkvale.sav). Backup it first!.

Found all the Potions and Spell Scrolls and gave me 9900 of each, and gold, gave me 983039.
The Scroll of Exploding Trap is a wonder, works as grenades !
Also the Scroll of Henchman helps to fight and distracts some enemies.

If you are a mage as me, later on you can get the Spell of Ring of Fire: this is extremely useful as it makes short work of almost anything (including some bosses).

For gold, just find the hex number of the gold you had when saving, change it to FF FF 0E.

For Health, Magic, Experience and Stoneskin Potions and Scrolls, find and use only the *1st* occurrence  (found 3 or 2 always) of a text (always shown on the right side as you scroll the file). 

Attention, must be the name *with an explanation -not a short version-, just as it appears in the inventory*.

From the last letter or number of that explanation, count *always* 66 places, and you'll find the number of items on the inventory,  in hexadecimal of course. 
If it isn't there, you are not in the right occurrence of the desired text.
Replace it with AC 26 (9900). 

Save and load the game with the modified save.

Hopefully, enjoy it as much as me !","UPDATE: march 2025

O.K. I went through this ordeal and actually finished it.
Played with a mage. Completed in 9 hours with a lot of useless running around to check things out, out of curiosity. So you could finish it in 7 hours or even less if you don't waste time in (optional) dungeons and follow the main quest, all bosses (even the final one) have simple mechanics, you won't miss 1 level or 2 to beat them.
Everything is mediocre to bad : graphics, sounds, settings, level design, very short field of view (fog at 20 meters), extremely weak character customization, very generic scenario (a villain archdemon wants to destroy the world), very generic dialogs (""you are a hero, you must follow the path to the darkest evil and follow the Light from your heart"").
A lot of glitches, some bugs (lost interface a couple of times), crashed three times to desktop, you can't alt-tab, mispellt words (e.g. the Archangel's name in quest announcing you defeated the final boss, is Gabriel but text says ""Garbriel""). Some finished quests will stay in your log as unfinished. You'll sometimes feel the real ""game"" is about understanding what bad programming is expecting of you.
Very low monster diversity. Monster skills sometimes don't make sense (ice mages are hurt with a normal damage by your ice attacks, and will attack you with... fire).
Easy bosses, sometimes slow or barely reacting as if they were stuck, with +-2 attacks, AI is so weak, you'll ""exploit"" the game without even wanting it, you'll use basic mechanisms: block/spam attacks/block/spam attacks... Frustrated a lot by the spider boss, extremely hard to beat (it's the only hard boss of the game) because of unfair adds, nets, poisons, super attacks, you'll relive exactly where you die surrounded by the boss and adds, good luck to heal you and run away (or not... you can't -> nets and adds block you). But if you beat it and complete the quest, it'll respawn later (why ?) and EVERYTIME you go through the zone (even if the spider is blocked in a small corner of the map and can't get out) she'll glue and make you fall every 10 seconds even if you are like 2 kms away from her (you'll see her spit flying through the map to get you). It must have been one of the weirdest bug (pun intended) I've seen in a video game.
Some annoying things: for instance you'll portal to a new zone but monsters will wait for you just beside it so they can knock you down before you can take control of your loading character.
A grand total of 4 dungeons that are... exactly copy-pasted on 2 different zones. A dungeon will take you from 3 to 10 minutes max, you can't save in dungeons, they are optional and not linked to the story or any quest, the loot is common, the bosses are common, the XP is common, they are ugly (short pathways surrounded by abyss).
You have 3 paths for your character: melee, magic and archery (yeah so original), it doesn't make sense to mix them up so you'll choose only one path. I took magic (6 predefined skills in total) but in the first 2 zones my melee staff hurt more than my spells (yeah I know, Gandalf fought with staff too!). You are limited to your path equipment: e.g. you must equip a staff to use magic skills. Loot is inconsistent (even after final boss, I never found a second ring for my mage), elite monsters will give you usual XP and not necessarily good loot. There are very few gear sets, attributes on good items didn't seem consistent or relevant to any path.
You'll find the usual RPG/MMO nonsense: a spiderling dropping an armour. The exact same NPC in 2 zones at the same time, etc.
One of the most annoying things: you'll often ""miss"" enemies in melee or they'll resist your distance attacks. Seriously when a spiderling resist 3 times in a row your magic attack or when you miss a giant standing 50 cms away from you, it feels like devs wanted to add stupid randomness to spice up and make boring fights longer to pretend there's a sort of complexity. Moving is painful (constant right-click on the ground), you can't hold down mouse button to move your character around.
No initial nor final movies (at the end I was expecting at least something cool like a cutscene or credits, but nothing happens), you have no name, you can't customize anything at start for your character, you have no initial explanations of what you are doing here and who you are. No cutscenes, but camera moving around the zone in engine mode to show you where you are supposed to go (completely useless actually because zones are very small and you have like 2 paths to explore).
Conclusion: if you were born for a sort of desperate mission on Earth to complete ALL RPG's, you can play this one (no game-breaking bug for me anyway), but if you don't like bad games or only want the good RPG's, avoid this at all cost.
PS : it's titled ""Episode I"", and after final boss, archangels say there are other stones to destroy so it meant other episodes were coming. But they won't.

Есть такая народная забава - раз в год брать игру с дерьмовыми отзывами и смотреть, может быть все не так уж плохо? Но нет, не в этот раз. 

 [code][b]Hazen[/b] - action/RPG от студии Dagger Games, выпущенная в 2010 году под руководством известного канадского издателя Strategy First, подарившего нам прекрасную серию Disciples. Игра имеет 42 отзыва Steam, 77% которых - отрицательные. И мой не станет исключением. Давайте разберем по полочкам, что же тут не так.[/code]

[u] [b] ๑۩۩๑ СЮЖЕТ ๑۩۩๑ [/b] [/u]

Исория в игре практически отсутствует. Я категорически отказываюсь считать то, что нам подкинули, как голодной собаке в качестве игровой затравки, но раз уж я отчаянно пытался эти крохи из игры выдавить, сам бог велел свести их все воедино тут - если не заинтересованы в местных ""хитросплетениях"", можете сразу спуститься к следующему абзацу. Некогда жил-был принц. Был он никчемен и бездарен, а еще было у него много братьев, каждый из коих был на голову его выше во всем. И не видать бы Хэйзену трона как своих ушей, если бы в один прекрасный миг на его пути не повстречался таинственный старец, с настойчивым намерением готовый помочь во всем. За небольшую плату, разумеется. Он создал для Хэйзена магический камень, который давал принцу огромную силу, с помощью которой последний, по всей видимости, сумел удержаться у власти. О больших подробностях история умалчивает, по всей видимости, ""интересное"" разработчики припасли на последующие части.  

Мы начинаем игру от лица жителя одной из местных деревень, внезапно оказавшейся в осаде нежити разных мастей. Ну как разных - на самом деле одинаковых моделек скелетов, держащих разное оружие. Жители недоумевают, как такое могло произойти и попутно раздают нам кучу бесполезных поручений. И вот, после того как мы нашли всех потерявшихся грузовых ослов и надежно затворили все ворота, местный староста внезапно хлопает себя по лбу и вспоминает, дескать, здешний травник-лекарь что-то пропал, а до этого он чем-то странным у себя там занимался. Надо бы сходить его проведать. Впоследствии мы узнаем, что этот самый лекарь и станет корнем всех зол, ибо вместо лечения населения тот практиковал некромантию и прочую темную ересь, а еще в руки к нему неведомым образом попал тот самый камень, что когда-то вручили Хэйзену и тут уж сама Вселенная велела творить зло по полной. Впрочем, исходя из ""разнообразия"" здешних монстров - фантазия у главзлодея - не самое сильное место. 

[u] [b] ๑۩۩๑ ГЕЙМПЛЕЙ ๑۩۩๑ [/b] [/u]

Игровой процесс в сущности схож с любым другим диаблоидом. Если хотите в двух словах - эдакий очень сильно порезанный во всем Titan Quest. С некачественной даже по меркам 2010 года графикой - эти жуткие угловатые деревья и налезающие друг на друга текстуры выглядят ужасным приветом из прошлого. Отдельно хотелось бы упомянуть абсолютно одинаковые модельки монстров, переходящие из одной локации в другую. Бегаете по сельской местности - вот вам скелеты. Горящий город? Вот эти же скелеты, только с горящими глазами. Ледяная пустошь - и тут можно этих же скелетов, только теперь они будут вас морозить. Вместе с разработчиками. 

Прокачка персонажа весьма стандартна и шаблонна. Есть три прокачиваемых параметра - сила (влияет на запас здоровья и наносимый урон), ловкость (скорость атаки и урон в дальнем бою) и интеллект (мана и сила магических заклинаний), а также три ветки умений - для ближнего и дальнего боя, а также магии соответственно. Прокачивать равномерно не получится - каждый предмет снаряжения будет требовать от вас по мере продвижения по сюжету все больших и больших значений конкретного параметра, и недокачивая его, вы рискуете в итоге остаться без какого-либо мало-мальски приличного шмота. В итоге так или иначе придется концентрироваться на чем-то одном. Ваш покорный слуга отдал предпочтение дальнему бою, и прогадал по всем фронтам - луки в игре не особо разнообразны, а учитывая скорость прицеливания - не особо полезны, но мне настолько ужасно не хотелось перепроходить это адище заново, что я решил смириться и выкручиваться тем, что есть. Эмпирическим путем было выяснено, что лучше всего брать воинское ремесло и прокачивать силу - одним параметром сразу же увеличиваете себе и урон, и здоровье. А в идеале - лучше взять Grim Dawn. 

После смерти персонаж перерождается в том же месте, где и умер. В окружении все тех же убивших вас ваншотом противников. Зачистить локацию у вас не получится, как бы Вы ни старались - убитые монстры будут пачками появляться снова и снова, не пройдет и пары минут со смерти предшественников. И это ужасно раздражает, учитывая необходимость постоянно мотаться по всей карте туда-сюда. Забавно, что в ходе прохождения я вкачивал дальнобойный урон на максимум и покупал самые топовые вещи, но даже будучи 10+ уровня тратил несколько выстрелов, чтобы убить первоуровневого скелета. Но это все ерунда по сравнению с той безумной тратой времени, которую вы убьете на бесполезную битву с местным главным злом. Я всем сердцем желаю разработчикам на том свете попасть в бесконечный цикл прохождения финальной битвы с иступляющим обстрелом этих гребанных башен.    

Музыка здесь местами как будто стибрена из Titan Quest, а иной раз выдает такую жуткую какофонию, что лучше бы её не было вовсе. Чтобы купить что-то у торговца, вам нужно самим в ручную перетаскивать это из одного инвентаря в другой - и это реальный гемор, особенно когда надо купить много зелий. Карта мира - бесполезный и неинформативный кусок пищепереработанных отходов, из которого можно понять лишь только то, что мы в полной жо*е. Но самая большая беда здесь - баги. Их много и они разные, но самый вредный среди прочих - внезапные вылеты. По мере прохождения я начал сохраняться буквально на каждом шагу - неизвестно, когда внезапно увидишь рабочий стол. Еще в игре отсутствует русская локализация, а на заморской мове цели и задачи порой формулируются от балды. Так, цель ""Восстановитесь после битвы с монстрами"" подразумевает что мы должны перейти через другой портал и найти там нового злодея, и все в таком духе.  

[u] [b] ๑۩۩๑ СТОИТ ЛИ ИГРАТЬ? ๑۩۩๑ [/b] [/u]   

По итогу получился эдакий очень обрезанный прототип Titan Quest, абсолютно по всем фронтам уступающий оригиналу. Игра выглядит и является очень сырой и недоработанной, и изначальные планы разработчиков выпустить еще несколько частей по этому миру звучат искренне смехотворно. Игра абсолютно не стоит своих денег - даже 10 рублей, за которые была мною куплена по местной скидке.

There's a popular pastime: once a year, pick up a game with shitty reviews and see if it's actually that bad. But no, not this time.

[code][b]Hazen[/b] is an action/RPG from Dagger Games, released in 2010 under the supervision of the renowned Canadian publisher Strategy First, the creators of the excellent Disciples series. The game has 42 Steam reviews, 77% of which are negative. Mine is no exception. Let's break down what's wrong here.[/code]

[u] [b] ๑۩۩๑ STORY ๑۩۩๑ [/b] [/u]

The game has virtually no story. I categorically refuse to accept the information they fed us like a game bait, but since I was desperately trying to squeeze these crumbs out of the game, it was a godsend to put it all together here – if you're not interested in the local intricacies, you can skip to the next paragraph. Once upon a time, there lived a prince. He was worthless and untalented, and he had many brothers, each head and shoulders above him in every way. And Hazen would never have seen the throne if he hadn't encountered a mysterious old man one day, determined to help him in any way. For a small fee, of course. He created a magical stone for Hazen, which granted the prince immense power, which he apparently used to maintain his grip on power. The story is silent on more details; apparently, the developers saved the ""interesting"" ones for later installments.

We begin the game as a resident of one of the local villages, suddenly besieged by undead of various kinds. Well, not different—in fact, identical skeleton models holding different weapons. The villagers are perplexed as to how this could have happened and give us a bunch of useless tasks. And then, after we've found all the lost cargo donkeys and securely locked all the gates, the local elder suddenly slaps his forehead and remembers that the local herbalist/healer has disappeared, and before that, he was up to something strange. We should go check on him. We later learn that this same healer will become the root of all evil, for instead of healing the populace, he practiced necromancy and other dark heresies, and somehow got his hands on the very stone that was once given to Heizen, and now the universe itself has commanded him to commit evil to the fullest. However, judging by the ""diversity"" of the monsters here, the main villain's imagination isn't his strong point.

[u] [b] ๑۩۩๑ GAMEPLAY ๑۩۩๑ [/b] [/u]

The gameplay is essentially similar to any other Diablo game. In short, it's a severely cut Titan Quest. With graphics that are poor quality even by 2010 standards, those creepy, angular trees and overlapping textures look like a terrifying blast from the past. I'd also like to mention the absolutely identical monster models that move from one location to another. Running through the countryside? There you have skeletons. A burning city? There are the same skeletons, only with glowing eyes. An icy wasteland? And here you can find the same skeletons, only now they'll freeze you. Along with the developers.

Character progression is fairly standard and formulaic. There are three stats you can upgrade: Strength (affects health and damage), Agility (attack speed and ranged damage), and Intelligence (mana and spell power), as well as three skill trees: one for melee, one for ranged combat, and one for magic. Leveling up evenly isn't possible—each piece of equipment will require increasingly higher values ​​for a specific stat as you progress through the story, and if you under-level it, you risk ending up without any decent gear. Ultimately, you'll have to focus on one thing or another. Your humble servant chose ranged combat and failed on all fronts—the bows in the game aren't particularly diverse, and given the aiming speed, they're not particularly useful. But I was so reluctant to replay this hellish world that I decided to accept the challenge and make do with what I had. Empirically, I've found that it's best to take the Warrior craft and level up Strength—you'll instantly increase both damage and health with a single stat. Ideally, Grim Dawn is the best choice.

After death, your character respawns in the same place where you died, surrounded by the same enemies who one-shot you. You won't be able to clear the location, no matter how hard you try—the monsters you killed will respawn in droves, within minutes of their death. This is incredibly annoying, considering you have to constantly run back and forth across the map. It's funny that during my playthrough, I maxed out my ranged damage and bought the best gear, but even at level 10+, it took me several shots to kill a level 1 skeleton. But all this is nothing compared to the insane amount of time you'll waste on a useless battle with the local main villain. I sincerely hope that the developers, in the afterlife, end up in an endless loop of the final battle, with the frenzied shelling of those damn towers.

The music here sometimes feels like it was ripped from Titan Quest, and at other times it produces such a terrible cacophony that it would be better if it weren't there at all. To buy something from a merchant, you have to manually drag it from one inventory to another—and it's a real pain, especially when you need to buy a lot of potions. The world map is a useless and uninformative piece of processed food waste, from which you can only understand that we're completely fucked. But the biggest problem here is the bugs. There are many of them, and they vary, but the most annoying of all are sudden crashes. As I progressed, I started saving literally at every turn—you never know when you'll suddenly see the desktop. The game also lacks a Russian localization, and in the foreign language, goals and objectives are sometimes formulated haphazardly. So, the objective ""Recover after fighting monsters"" implies that we have to go through another portal and find a new villain there, and so on.

[u] [b] ๑۩۩๑ IS IT WORTH PLAYING? ๑۩۩๑ [/b] [/u] 

The result is a very truncated Titan Quest prototype, inferior to the original in every way. The game looks and feels very raw and unfinished, and the developers' original plans to release several more installments in this world sound genuinely laughable. The game is absolutely not worth the money—even the 10 rubles I bought it for at a local discount.

Well, I like pretty much all genres (yes, I'm one of those people who like [i]everything[/i] as long as it wants you to press buttons), but there's something about [b]ARPG[/b]s I find especially pleasant.

Naturally, I didn't want to miss this one. Just because it's an [b]ARPG[/b]. But as long as you're not like me and don't aim for beating each and every [b]ARPG[/b] out there? You shouldn't play this one. Seriously, you consider buying it? Just stop reading and remove it from your cart. It sucks. End of the story. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's take some time and go into some details.

First of all – this game is bad. Wait, did I already say that? OK, I did. And still, this game is [i]bad[/i]. But no matter how bad it is, it's not a scam. In other words, it isn't [b]Grind Zones[/b]. Isn't one of those games that were supposed to look OK on screens but were never supposed to be a real deal, to provide you any real gameplay. [b]HAZEN[/b]? It was supposed to be played. You pay for a game – you get a game. Well... sort of. See, there are two things about [b]HAZEN[/b] (the game is called after its main villain, exactly the same way with [b]Diablo[/b]). And the first thing is – it was supposed to be episodic. We have only five small maps here and the story (if we can call this bunch of cheap nonsense a story) ends with a cliffhanger. You know how it is... They planned an episodic game, the first one failed, there were no more episodes ever made. And that's the first thing about [b]HAZEN[/b]. It's only a first episode of the series that was never made.

And as for the second thing... Well, let's just say it was made by noobs. And it shows. The last time I saw something this noobish was in Ukrainian [b]ARPG[/b] called [b]Dark Tower Conspiracy[/b] (AKA [b]Dungeon Quest[/b], AKA [b]Заговор Тёмной Башни[/b]), back in [b]2006[/b]. And even though [b]HAZEN[/b] is Bulgarian game, it really does feel the same. But you can clearly see that it wasn't because the developers were scammers. It was just because some noobs with no experience decided that they are cool developers and can make their own [b]Torchlight[/b]. Here's a hint – they aren't and they can't.

But OK, what exactly is so bad about [b]HAZEN[/b]? Well, everything. Everything about it is bad. Looking at core gameplay here you'll thank God for this game being too short. Things like balance, tactics and stuff like that? Forget about them. I mean, I know that the genre is all about them. Just... forget about them here. [b]HAZEN[/b] is not a game where you count numbers and make builds. It's a game, in which you run through some small maps by using the only character you can use, click on some generic enemies, die, respawn right under your enemies' feet, finish your job and continue. That's pretty much it. Painfully cheap and painfully random experience.

So... yeah. [b]HAZEN[/b] is yet another disaster. The one where final product suffered from its makers having way too much ambitions without enough skill and talent to support them. You want a good game? Run as fast from here as you can. You don't mind something meh in the genre either? Nope, keep running. No matter how you look at [b]HAZEN[/b], it's a no-no product.

Find a donkey which gives you a quest. Nothing appears on the screen, I have to go into the quest log to find it. Apparently the town in which I came not only has a locked doors issue, but now needs flour. This donkey has flour. Time to save the day via bread. 

Then it crashed. 

Best part of the game in my opinion."

Игра мне очень понравилась, хотя некоторых нововведений сделать всё же не мешало бы. Например, более привычную систему управления, выбор и кастомизацию персонажей, более понятную карту местности и цели квестов на карте.
В остальном игра хороша. Не знаю, почему многие жаловались на графику, ведь она для игры и так отличная.
В общем, игра стоит своих денег. Для тех, кому нравится жанр РПГ, игра придётся в самый раз.","I read other reviews, but I still bought this game (and the reviews are mostly negative).
I really liked the game, although some improvements would have been nice. For example, a more familiar control system, character selection and customization, a clearer map and quest objectives on the map.
Otherwise, the game is good. I don't know why so many people complained about the graphics, because they are already excellent for the game.
Overall, the game is worth the money. For those who enjoy RPGs, this game is perfect."

I actually reloaded this game and forced myself to learn and play the game.  Objectively, it's pretty sound - as most hack-n-slash follow similar key-binding layouts and mouse-behaviours of well-known games of this genre (i.e. Diablo).  I think the majority of the negative reviews come from those that have played Diablo or similar hack-n-slash games as Hazen introduces a differing layout for control movement and attack.

If you must buy an ARPG get ether Torchlight 1/2, Van Hellsing, Titan quest, Grim Dawn or any other less known ARPGs.

Or go for gold just get 'Path of Exile' and never look back.
 Look on Youtube for videos of Hazen, it's plain broken and bad.","This is the worst ARPG I've ever played.

For a cheap game it's not that bad. Bit unpolished maybe. And I've been told it's pretty short (since it's an episode). My advice ? Hmm, I don't know...
