結尾是無限循環","I asked my friend to help me record my thoughts while playing:

The first thing I noticed when I started the game was the volume.

The settings are counterintuitive; I can't adjust the language or brightness.

The font is too small, and I need a 4K monitor to play it.

The optimization is terrible; it feels like playing the Switch version of Apex Legends.

The tutorial is choppy and makes me want to quit.

The rendering is terrible, and the screen is too dark, which echoes the second point.

The walking animation looks like tap dancing.

The animation and sound effects are terrible.

It's too dark, damn!

The game is called ""At Home,"" but I feel like he's not at home.

The game engine is great, but the optimization is terrible. I don't know why.

The rendering is terrible, I'll write it again.

You can't sit on the swings.

The textures are terrible.

The movement feels terrible, again.

The flashlight only has a view of the right half of the screen.

What are you thinking?

You can jump and run. Recommended.

The rendering is terrible, I'll write it again.

The sign behind the house is mirrored. Are you too broke to hire a director?

Genshin Impact is more fun.

The music is too repetitive. I'll keep writing.

The first door after entering the house is very obstructive.

The kitchen has too few unnecessary items. Delete
The clock won't move and the toilet won't work. Bad review. Cheap, cheap, cheap.
Botchi·za·roku
Chuunibyou's hands are so ugly.
A bunch of empty rooms, I don't know what they're for.
He's lost.
He doesn't know how to use the props, stupid idiot.
He keeps trying to open a door that won't open. I wish he'd grow some brains x3.
There's no instructions for the props.
Stuck on a level. Bad review.
Hey, help me find a walkthrough. This game shouldn't have a walkthrough.
The flashlight is stupid +1.
That utterly empty thing must have something inside it—this year's chuunibyou.
The game doesn't support driving into houses, even though you're given car keys.
Where's the keyhole for the car?—this year's chuunibyou.
You can't climb the ladder 😡
But you can climb the car, awesome!
There's no animation for driving. Bad review.
The plot doesn't make sense. Keep writing bad reviews. Oh, no, he doesn't have a plot.
There's a pile of shit in this large intestine.
It's too dark x3.
There's no reason I can't beat this thing—this year's chuunibyou.
Open I say Open fuck———This year's chuuni

He just broke into the house through a closed window. I don't know.

All the windows here are unlocked doors.

Got a crowbar, but can't knock on your own car.

Crowbar = front door key.

Entering the house through the window doesn't seem like a bug, it's the normal way to beat the game.

The driving time was too long, but I was just sitting in the car waiting for it to start.

This game is crazy———This year's chuuni

Oh my god, there are fucking animations. Good points. Keep writing.

There are two animations. Keep writing.

There are three animations. Keep writing.

The sound effects are terrible.

The font is very small. Write again.

Recalling the animations is pointless.

Where's my phone?———This year's chuuni

It doesn't make sense.

The ending is an infinite loop."

Я не знаю, может, тут есть какая-то глубокая мысль, но для меня она кончилась, когда персонаж попал во второй раз в локацию с домом: я нашла ключ, в доме есть закрытая дверь, которая не открывается этим ключом. А видно, что ключ от комнаты в доме, так как на ключ от машины он не похож. Эта игра - выброшенные деньги в никуда.","Don't buy this, don't. I don't know, maybe there's some deeper meaning here, but for me it ended when the character entered the house location for the second time: I found a key, and there's a locked door in the house that doesn't open with the key.

Так и не понял где конец, из-за этого прошел игру 2 раза(. Из плюсов геймплея, я хочу подметить довольно хороший саун-дизайн. Звуки постоянно напоминают, что наиграть надо меньше 2 часов, а то не вернуть деньги. Сюжет я так и не понял. Нас держат взаперти в каком-то сарае. Мы выбираемся оттуда, грабим дом, заправку и угоняем машину. Смысловая нагрузка, в отличии от чувства страха имеется. Сложно пройти мимо такого шедевра американского геймдева. Ставлю 7 мельниц из 10. (Напомнило PT)","People say they can't see anything. But there's a flashlight in the game, so you can see everything. The game is designed in an unusual way. I never figured out where the end was, so I played it through twice. On the gameplay side, I'd like to point out the pretty good sauna design. The sounds constantly remind you to play for less than two hours or you won't get your money back. I still don't understand the plot. We're locked in a barn. We escape, rob a house, a gas station, and steal a car. There's a meaningful message, as opposed to just the sense of fear. It's hard to pass up this masterpiece of American game development. I give it 7 out of 10. (Reminded me of PT)"

Mais une expérience comme celle-ci j'en ai jamais vécu/ En stream en plus.
C'est simple, c'est une abomination. La totalité de mon Walkhtough était un bug.
Littéralement. Quand j'ai été voir une vidéo sur Youtube parce que n'arrivait plus à avancer, je n'ai pas vu le même jeu.
La clé que je devais trouver n'existait pas dans mon jeu. Et toutes les autres ""énigmes"" du jeu, je ne les avait pas eu : les portes censées être fermées étaient ouvertes. Résultat, dans l'hilarité générale, j'ai pu lancer une sorte de fin de jeu juste en déclenchant ce qui permettait de le faire, sans avoir du tout à faire le jeu. Puis j'ai fini dans un décors sans fin. puis en forçant, le jeu a rebooté, cette-fois ci il semblait correctement lancé. 
Il ne se finit pas, il reboote en boucle, en laissant supposer que c'est fait exprès mais en fait c'est complètement buggué et semble se comporter aléatoirement.
Le reste est à l'avenant, optimisé avec le zboub peu importe le PC (obligé de jouer en qualité Moyenne), avec des bugs graphiques rarement vu et un Headbobbing de l'enfer qui donne la gerbe.

Je me fais rembourser mes 40ct, pas un sou dans la poche d'un dev qui a voulu faire croire que son truc bricolé en soirée cuite puisse être vendu, jouable, voire même avec une idée ou un fond. 

La dernière fois que j'ai eu cette sensation de jouer au pire jeu de Steam, c'était un jeu avec du caca, c'est dire.","I've played some crappy games. Seriously. It's even disturbing.
But I've never had an experience like this before/ Even on stream.
It's simple, it's an abomination. My entire Walkthrough was a bug.
Literally. When I went to watch a video on YouTube because I couldn't progress anymore, I didn't see the same game.
The key I was supposed to find didn't exist in my game. And all the other ""puzzles"" in the game, I hadn't gotten them: the doors that were supposed to be closed were open. As a result, amidst general hilarity, I was able to trigger a sort of endgame simply by triggering whatever allowed it, without having to play the game at all. Then I ended up in an endless landscape. Then, by forcing it, the game rebooted, this time it seemed to be running correctly.
It doesn't finish, it reboots in a loop, leading you to believe it's done on purpose, but in fact it's completely buggy and seems to behave randomly.
The rest is similar, optimized with the zboub regardless of the PC (forced to play on Medium quality), with rarely seen graphical bugs and headbobbing from hell that makes you puke.

I'm getting my 40 cents refunded, not a penny in the pocket of a developer who wanted to make people believe that his thing, cobbled together during a drunken evening, could be sold, played, or even had an idea or substance.

The last time I had this feeling of playing the worst game on Steam, it was a game with crap, that's saying something."

Нічого цікавого. Ходиш по невеликій локації (яка, до речі, перекочувала з гри Polterheist), знаходиш предмети: ліхтарик, лом, ключ від машини та зовсім не потрібний ключ від заправки. Не потрібний він, бо адекватно в заправку всерівно не потрапити - треба лізти через вікно (про даний трюк знаю ще з проходження гри Polterheist).
Знайшовши ключ від машини - можна втекти. При першій втечі потрапляєш в глухий кут, де у лісі після нетривалих блукань тебе знову ловлять й повертають назад. При другому ж заході, ти зіткнешся з ворожою машиною й зловиш глюки, після чого цикл починається спочатку. Я так зрозумів, що гра не має кінця, принаймні, я не бачив щоб хтось її пройшов.

There's not a lot of substance to the game and *spoiler* there's no real threat the entire time. The ambiance is pretty good as I was on edge a bit with the creaking windmill and such, despite being pretty sure there was no real threat. The ambiance and approaching sounds in the woods when you attempt to escape where pretty good too.

Towards the beginning, the lights go out and the doorbell rings. At this time, while you can still find your way to the door, it's very difficult to see and from a game playing perspective near total darkness in a game where you have to actually feel your way around is not fun, it's just annoying. I also felt like some mechanics weren't really explained, such as starting up the car and in a much smaller case, opening the shake's door. Both require multiple tries, with the car being a lot more unpredictable as far as how long you have to hold the button, or how many times you have to press it.

All in all, I do appreciate the effort that that creator(s) put into making a game. Like I said, good ambiance and graphics. The controls were a bit off, some minor details weren't very clear, the game didn't really have an actual end, and that scene at the beginning was waaay too dark. Honestly, if the game didn't loop (or if it had and ending to be more clear that I missed it) and it had an actual resolution and the scene at the beginning wasn't so pitch black, I could be a bit more iffy. Hope you create more stuff, stay on it because you've got a start to something, but it just needs a little more of a push.","While this game's visuals are pretty nice, $5 to me is kind of pushing it.

54132912,german,2019.06.16 22:21,❌,✅,0.6109475493,7,"""At Home"" ist ein First-Person Horror-Game.

Wir werden von ein paar Unbekannten überfallen und  in ein kleines Versteck gesteckt. Als wir aufwachen kriegen wir zwar die Tür auf, können aber von dem Grundstück, auf dem ein normal großes Haus, eine Scheune und eine kleine Tankstelle steht nicht entkommen. Das liegt eigentlich nur an den unsichtbaren Wänden, die um das Areal gezogen wurden. Würden wir es realistisch sehen, bräuchten wir einfach nur loszuspazieren...

Aber davon abgesehen ist das Game auch ansonsten eine einzige Frechheit, denn es ist dasselbe Spiel wie ""Polterheist"". Also nicht nur vom Prinzip her, es ist genau das gleiche Spiel. Wir befinden uns auf genau demselben Grundstück mit demselben Haus, vor dem dieselben Autos stehen und dieselbe Scheune steht. Alles ist genau gleich. Sogar die Sounds sind gleich. Nur das grottige, nicht funktionierende Gameplay hat eine etwas andere Ausrichtung. Also, wir müssen auch Schlüssel finden und so, nur halt irgendwie anders. Also irgendwie so. Und müssen immerhin nicht einbrechen.

Ansonsten funktioniert gar nichts in dieser Asset-Set-Ansammlung. Witzig, daß wir eines der Autos, die vor dem Haus stehen einfach so vor uns herschieben können. Voll die Superkräfte.

Selbst wenn es nicht eine Kopie von ""Polterheist"" wäre, würde das Spiel auch so null Spaß machen. Das Spielgefühl ist grauenhaft, die Atmosphäre bescheuert, mechanisch funktioniert so gut wie gar nichts und man fragt sich immer nur, weshalb man denn mit diesem Datenmüll belästigt werden muss.

Am besten auf den Punkt bringen läßt sich das Game durch den Hintereingang des Hauses. Macht man diese Tür auf, befindet sich dahinter ein winziger, völlig leerer Raum von zwei Mal zwei Meter. Keine Tür, nichts. Vorhanden, aber völlig sinnfrei. Und genauso ist das ganze Spiel.

[h1]Fazit:[/h1]
1 zu 1 Kopie von ""Polterheist"".

[h1][b]1/10 Gesamtwertung","""At Home"" is a first-person horror game.

We're ambushed by a few strangers and put in a small hideout. When we wake up, we manage to open the door, but we can't escape from the property, which contains a normal-sized house, a barn, and a small gas station. This is actually only due to the invisible walls that have been built around the area. If we were to be realistic, we'd just have to start walking...

But apart from that, the game is also a complete joke, because it's the same game as ""Polterheist."" And not just in principle, it's exactly the same game. We're on the exact same property with the same house, with the same cars parked in front of it, and the same barn. Everything is exactly the same. Even the sounds are the same. Only the crappy, dysfunctional gameplay has a slightly different focus. So, we also have to find keys and stuff, just somehow differently. Like, kind of like that. And at least we don't have to break in.

Otherwise, nothing in this asset set collection works. It's funny that we can just push one of the cars parked in front of the house in front of us. Superpowers.

Even if it weren't a copy of ""Polterheist,"" the game would be zero fun anyway. The gameplay is horrible, the atmosphere is stupid, mechanically almost nothing works, and you're constantly wondering why you have to be bothered with this data garbage.

The game can best be summed up by the back entrance of the house. If you open this door, there's a tiny, completely empty room measuring two meters by two meters. No door, nothing. There, but completely pointless. And that's exactly what the whole game is like.

During your first few seconds of the game, you'll be stopped at 1 second intervals to be fed a haphazard tutorial. The lights will go out and you'll be stuck, wandering aimlessly in the pitch-dark for a phone. You've seen a phone, so you try to pick it up to no avail. You wander around more, maybe find a door that opens to the outside and you step through it. You then wake up in a shack that you have to stumble out of. You'll find a flashlight and, eventually, a key amid the primarily empty rooms of the house you were just in. You'll try to use the key everywhere, including a barn and a gas station, until you realize that you need to use it in a vehicle. The vehicle does nothing... unless you keep holding the W key and then it will eventually go.

What do you do then? Do you drive away from this abominable shack? Of course not. The truck drops you off in the middle of a road, presumably having broke down, and you run in a straight line for the next 2 minutes until you wind up back at... you guessed it... the same house. You find a key, go into the house and find another key, go back to the gas station to get, le gasp, a crowbar, so that you can go get the key to the same truck that broke down which is now somehow back at the house, and you get in the truck and drive away. Game over, you start again from the beginning. Freaking BRILLIANT.

You'll do all of this garbage while using a flashlight that only points to the right 1/3rd of your screen; making the other 2/3rds completely useless. Let this be a lesson to you folks, always check and double check the developer and publisher of a game. If I had noticed that At Home was made by the same dingleberry that made Polterheist I would've never wasted a buck. The best thing about this game is that the store page (and in-game tutorial) says that you have to be quiet and stealthy to avoid being detected by cameras. Spoiler alert, there are no cameras. One of the biggest crocks of crap on Steam, neigh unrivaled.

[quote=][u]At Home[/u] is a game with failed potential. In At Home, strangers come into your house and kidnap you. You then must escape from the locked hut you find yourself in. The description can continue, but as another reviewer put it, “[a] lot of words [in the description,] but not all true.” The story is poorly written, there is no fear of dying because you never see the kidnappers, there is no need for stealth, the game is plagued with bugs, and questionable technical decisions run amok.

Where is the storyline? In At Home, there are no journal notes, no dialogue, and no other information that offers any insight into the story. We never see the kidnappers and the game has no real ending – it just loops to the beginning. A big point of contention for me and other players is the power outage event during the introduction. Here, we must echolocate a phone ring in a pitch-black apartment. It is frustrating because you can literally see nothing, movement seems clunky, and we had no prior opportunity to scan the layout. 

The element of ‘stealth’ should be excluded from the game’s description. At Home advises us to be careful of where we hide because the kidnappers have placed CCTV cameras around the house. But until those CCTV  are actually implemented, we will remain free to run around and explore without fear of dying. In addition, if you were to die, or say, take a break, then you would have to start over from the beginning because there are no save points.

[u]At Home[/u] has the potential to become a good Stealth game. But developer [u]BisquitPlay[/u] has to become more involved with the community for that to happen. They released At Home on March 27, 2019 and already by May of the same year it was discounted at 90% of the original price. That is not a good indicator.

Сюжет в двух слова: сидишь такой у себя дома, и вдруг кто-то НЕОЖИДАННО отключает свет! ВДРУГ зазвонил телефон!! Пытаешься найти источник звука, но находишь лишь проблемы: ВАС ПОХИТИЛИ!!!

Позже мы оказываемся в каком-то сарае с дверью, которая открывается после ""N"" нажатий. Выбравшись из него мы попадаем на не большую локацию с домом, абсолютно пустым амбаром, заправкой и парой тачек. 

Найдя заботливо подсвеченный разработчиком фонарик, который освещает только ПРАВУЮ часть экрана вместо центральной, а после исследования дома и ключ от машины(!), нам дают проехать на ней целых  ДВА МЕТРА, после чего магия загрузки перенесет нас в тупик дороги, откуда нам уже без фонарика(!) придется бежать по лесу до очередного удара тупым предметом по голове.

И тут начинается ""День сурка"", который я, честно, сам осилить не смог, а попытки найти тех, кто смог, не увенчались успехом.

Игроку предстоит совершить те же действия, но теперь вам будут мешать закрытые двери, для которых надо искать ключи или просто зайти через окно. А точнее сказать СКВОЗЬ окно. Опять попытки уехать, какие-то кат-сцены с едущей нам на встречу машиной и потом вроде бы все повторяется. Или это игра уже закончилась и началась заново. Я не знаю. Никто не знает.
На этом вроде бы весь контент и заканчивается. 

[h1]ВЫВОД[/h1]
Этот ""хоррор"" не разу не страшный, сюжета здесь нет, а геймплей вызывает не увлечение, а раздражение. Карточек и ачивментов тоже не завезли. Покупать ЭТО не рекомендую.

","At Home is a game in the ""What should I do? Where should I go?"" genre, very popular among indie developers, with a hint of horror.

The plot, in a nutshell: you're sitting at home, and suddenly someone UNEXPECTEDLY turns off the power! SUDDENLY, the phone rings!! You try to find the source of the sound, but all you find is trouble: YOU'VE BEEN KIDNAPPED!!!

Later, we find ourselves in a barn with a door that opens after ""N"" keystrokes. After escaping, we find ourselves in a small location with a house, a completely empty barn, a gas station, and a couple of cars.

Having found a flashlight, thoughtfully illuminated by the developer, which only illuminates the RIGHT side of the screen instead of the center, and after exploring the house and the car key (!), we're allowed to drive it a full TWO METERS, after which the loading magic takes us to a dead end, from where we, now without a flashlight (!), must run through the forest until we get hit again with a blunt object.

And then ""Groundhog Day"" begins, which I honestly couldn't complete on my own, and attempts to find those who could were unsuccessful.

The player must complete the same actions, but now you'll be hindered by locked doors, for which you'll have to find keys or simply enter through a window. Or rather, THROUGH a window. More attempts to leave, some cutscenes with a car driving towards us, and then everything seems to repeat itself. Or maybe the game has already ended and started over. I don't know. No one knows.
That seems to be where all the content ends.

[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]
This ""horror"" isn't scary at all, there's no plot, and the gameplay is irritating rather than engaging. There are no cards or achievements either. I don't recommend buying THIS.

in the first 5 minutes I got stuck because they turn off all of the lights at the start FORCING you to wander through pitch darkness until you get clocked in the back of the head,
Then you wake up in a cabin where the only way out is getting bored/frustrated resulting in mashing E on the door until the lock actually breaks.
and then you have to wander another house in PITCH BLACK AGAIN to find a car key,
and even if you manage to find the flashlight near the van its super-awkward to use since its stuck pointing to the far right of your screen.
I dont want to spoil more but I just want to say I was dissapointed that almost ALL of the puzzles could only be solved by getting either frustrated or bored and mashing the E or A key.
I also want my money back","It was a very big mistake of me to buy this game.

But all I ended up doing was finding texture pop in, glitches, and aggravation. I feel like I'm just stupid, but that'd be too brutally honest. So I'll just give the game a 5/10
