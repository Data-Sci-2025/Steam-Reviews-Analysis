The language select launch is also buggy and unreliable crashing the game preventing it from launching or stubbornly launching it in German anyway a few times before it somehow remembered my preference to finally display in English.,I could forgive potato graphics but I cannot forgive the unreliable jank of how this game sets you up to see color coded failures in beam loads and suddenly decides to hide this along with your entire bridge beams disappearing.

Lack of customization, a bit unclear for the stress test (because sometimes the bridge is green, but as soon as the first car enters the first section of track, the bridge collapses, so it goes from green to collapse. Yeah :-( ) (even Bridge Constructor on Android does better)
Lack of variability in the levels because the designer wants us to build the bridge he decided on (the budget is generally too short or just a piece) (at least in the first 8 easy levels, we'll see later).
I haven't tried the sandbox yet because you have to earn/unlock the coins.
The soundtrack is a bit lacking in change, the music is nice, but it's the same for all the It's a bit of a loop.
It lacks the ability to rotate around the pond, and it lacks the ability to test several different types of traffic or test the pond against the earthquake, the wind, etc.

Was in der ersten Minute nach einem einfachen Spiel aussieht entpuppt sich als anspruchsvolles Knobelspiel. Die Physik arbeitet einwandfrei und unermüdlich gegen den Spieler. Sind die ersten Brücken noch schnell gebaut so steigt der Schwierigkeitsgrad später stark an. Viele verschiedene Bauelemente die mit einer ausgewogenen Lernkurve verknüpft sind sorgen für Abwechslung. Das tolle an dem Spiel ist allerdings die Herausforderung. Oft habe ich mich erwischt, wie ich aufhören wollte aber dann ist mir wieder was eingefallen wie meine Brücke doch stabil und befahrbar werden könnte. Bridge sieht einfach aus, fordert einem aber alles ab und lässt einen nicht mehr los. Echter Suchtfaktor und das Erfolgserlebnis nach Fertigstellung einer stabilen Brücke sind die großen Stärken dieses Games. Jeder Hobbybastler der weiß warum ein Stein nach unten fällt kann hier bedenkenlos zuschlagen. Für echte Ingenieure oder die die es werden wollen ist das Spiel ein absolutes Muss um gerade auf den Höheren Levels sich selbst sein Können und Talent zu beweisen. Daumen hoch für Bridge.   
","An addictive challenge.
What looks like a simple game at first turns out to be a challenging puzzle game. The physics work flawlessly and tirelessly against the player. While the first bridges are quickly built, the difficulty level increases significantly later on. Many different building elements combined with a balanced learning curve ensure variety. The great thing about the game, however, is the challenge. I often found myself wanting to give up, but then I came up with another way to make my bridge stable and drivable. Bridge looks simple, but demands everything from you and doesn't let you go. The real addictiveness and the sense of achievement after completing a stable bridge are the great strengths of this game. Any hobbyist who knows why a stone falls can jump in without hesitation. For real engineers or those who want to become one, the game is an absolute must-have, especially at the higher levels, to prove their skills and talent. Thumbs up for Bridge.

Die Missionen sind anfangs recht leicht, spätere Levels sind dann wirklich anspruchsvoll. Wenn man länger spielt kommen acuh immer mehr Nauteile hinzu, erst dann sieht man auch wie real die Physik umgesetzt worden ist. Vom Gameplay und der Grafik bin ich völlig zufrieden. Insgesamt ein sehr schönes Game was man auch mal zwischendurch spielen kann aber dennnoch den Ansprüchen einer echten Simulation erfüllt.","Bridge may be a few years old, but it's still fun to play. The missions start off fairly easy, but later levels become truly challenging. As you play for longer, more and more elements are added, and only then do you really appreciate how realistic the physics are. I'm completely satisfied with the gameplay and graphics. Overall, it's a very nice game that you can play now and again, but still meets the requirements of a true simulation."
