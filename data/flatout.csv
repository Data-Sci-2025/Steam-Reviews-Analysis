For your sake (you, go drink some water), I wouldn't recommend this game. It's a glitch-fest and written badly. In arenas, every car will target you (counterpoint: the chaos can be enjoyable), in races cars handle like boats (counterpoint: learning how to circumvent the issues is satisfying) and the game overall feels hollow (counterpoint: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯).

It feels like a product of its time and yet much older (NFS High Stakes felt more progressively rewarding). Character models look like something out of a mobile game (worse than Payback 2 on Android, actually). The cars aren't memorable. The zombie hunting mode is alright, but damage against and from other cars is more inconsistemt than many DS games (they're like 32MB tops for goodness sake, look into it one way or another).

The soundtrack is pretty cool though.

TL;DR, don't spend more than a quid on this if you must.

In 2025 I played on Linux Mint 22.1 (now 22.2) with an AMD 4500U. I get 60fps everywhere with Proton 9 (save for very heavy explosions), but restarts freeze the game for 3 seconds. I think it did this when I originally played on Windows 10 with an AMD A9-9400 APU (HP 24-e080na), so don't expect the game to be solid.","There are times when I can enjoy this game.

Aver, como se sabe es de los peores juegos reseñados en la plataforma, que decir... es malo si jasjsaj pero, no le encontré bugs que afecten o dañen tu partida, a lo mucho bajabas una rampa elevada y tu coche salia por los aires bien random pero ocurrió poco, de resto tiene una gran variedad de vehículos y personalizables, que se van desbloqueando a lo largo que ganes eventos, si tienes habilidad al conducir te las arreglas para la conducción y estilo del juego... (si aguantas)

Muchos eventos, el de monster truck y acabar con zombis me parecieron bastante divertidos, el restos bueh... a veces te toca una IA rotisima que no podrás alcanzar jamas, por suerte te sales de la carrera y volves a entrar para que te salga otro rival, en el tema de logros se demora un poco en las carreras que son varias y por si no fuera poco, te ponen un modo desafió para volver a sufrir la mayoría de pruebas que lograste superar xd

No lo jueguen por su salud ☠️ pero, si son caza logros y quieren un desafió pues adelante y sufre como yo, ten en cuenta que necesitas un amigo para sacar el logro de jugar una partida online, el resto es singleplayer. 
Adiós flatout 3 me voy con orgullo de tenerte junto a mis juegos completados 🍷



","God Flatout 3... I don't know what was going through my head when I decided to play this title and on top of that, platinum it 💀 They already label it as psychological horror XDD

Well, as we know, it's one of the worst games reviewed on the platform, what can I say... it's bad, yes, hahaha, but I didn't find any bugs that affect or damage your game. At most, you'd go down an elevated ramp and your car would fly through the air, very randomly, but that didn't happen much. Otherwise, it has a wide variety of customizable vehicles, which are unlocked as you win events. If you're skilled at driving, you'll manage to master the driving and style of the game... (if you can handle it).

There are a lot of events. The monster truck and killing zombies seemed quite fun to me. The rest, well... sometimes you run into a really broken AI that you'll never be able to catch. Luckily, you can leave the race and re-enter so that another rival can appear. Regarding achievements, it takes a while in the races, which are several, and just in case... If that weren't enough, they give you a challenge mode so you can replay most of the tests you managed to overcome lol

Don't play it for your own good ☠️ but, if you're an achievement hunter and want a challenge, go ahead and suffer like me. Keep in mind that you need a friend to get the achievement for playing an online match; the rest is single-player.
Goodbye Flatout 3, I'm proud to have you next to my completed games 🍷

Геймплей почти ни о чём, единственное, что там было хоть чуть-чуть прикольно, - так это ехать и сбивать зомби.

Игра никак не относится к остальным частям Flatout - просто посмешище, а не игра. Не старайтесь даже пройти игру, не портите себе нервы, просто унылая часть игры, над которой, по-моему, не старались. Лучше поиграйте в Flatout 2 - реально годная часть игр Flatout.

There are simply no physics in the game, or the developers, when they were making it, said, ""Oh, fuck physics, who needs it?""

This game has nothing to do with the other Flatout games—it's a complete joke. Don't even bother trying to beat it; don't waste your time. It's just a dull part of the game that, in my opinion, wasn't even worth the effort. It's better to play Flatout 2—it's a truly decent Flatout game.

Итак, почему же игра так плоха?

Меню встречает нас регулярно всплывающим информационным окном, настоятельно рекомендующим получить рейтинг производительности (был такой показатель в Windows 7; возможно имеется в виду что-то другое, но не факт). Кроме главного меню эта просьба указать рейтинг так же отображается в настройках графики. Причём вы не можете зайти в дополнительные настройки без указания рейтинга. Благо, что окно вылезает только при первом запуске, хотя в дальнейшем у меня всё равно не получилось зайти в дополнительные настройки. Игра в целом плоховато оптимизирована, заметны подлагивания на каждом переходе по пунктам меню.

Управление очень неотзывчивое — машина скользит по дороге как коробок насвая по карману разработчика, но при этом она как будто приклеена к поверхности трассы и очень неохотно реагирует на на ваши попытки ей управлять. В то же время, стоит только коллизии дать себя проявить, как машина отправится покорять околоземную орбиту, вращаясь при этом вокруг своей оси, но шанс такого всего лишь 50/50 при каждом столкновении с посторонним объектом.

Графика. Я не из тех, кто будет ругать игру за плохую графику, потому что это всегда можно обыграть стилем и придать игре этакий ретро-шарм, но даже без этого у меня почти никогда не возникает претензий к игре с очевидным отсутствием сглаживания или плохо сделанными эффектами, однако... Когда я выставляю настройки на ""ультра"" и вижу какое-то ""мыло с лесенками"", у меня возникают вопросы, потому что игра 2011-го года выглядит как консольный/мобильный порт малоизвестной низкобюджетной игры.  

Режим ""карьеры"", насколько я понимаю, отсутствует. Вместо него нас ждёт ряд испытаний (всего 50) и другие режимы игры, каждый из которых видимо можно настроить, выбрав количество соперников, кругов и прочие атрибуты. Тюнинга нет, иногда только можно выбрать готовые пресеты под определённые задачи, причём несмотря на то, что указываются параметры автомобиля, вам не показывают их изменение в зависимости от выбранного тюнинга...

Какие режимы есть в игре? 

Обычная гонка
- Дерби (зачем-то разделены на два вида: большие и маленькие)
- ""Найди и разрушь что-то на большом траке""
- Гонки на боллидах
- Гонка ночью при дожде и тумане
- Бездорожье без правил, но с подсчётом очков за определённые действия
- Проезд по маршруту с зомби, которых надо сбивать чтобы заработать очки
- Трюки, в которых даже нельзя управлять ""запуском"" водителя (в предыдущих частях игра показывала угол ""броска"" и замедляла время для точности, тут такого нет)

При этом игра не запоминает настройки камеры между гонками, хотя в предыдущих двух частях это было. Мелочь, но неприятно.

Ещё в игре довольно странно подсчитываются показатели, что, возможно, связано с метрической системой, но я не уверен. Пример: ваш прыжок на 2 метра может быть отображён как прыжок на 20 метров. Это, наверное, ни на что не влияет, но это показалось мне странным, поэтому я решил отметить данный факт.

Вердикт: не стоит вашего внимания (и уж тем более денег)

","Despite the game's ""Extremely Negative"" ratings, I decided to check it out myself, as most reviews don't provide any specifics.

So, why is the game so bad?

The menu regularly greets us with a pop-up information window, strongly recommending we get a performance rating (this was the same metric in Windows 7; perhaps they're referring to something else, but I'm not sure). In addition to the main menu, this request to enter a rating also appears in the graphics settings. Moreover, you can't access the advanced settings without entering a rating. Fortunately, this window only appears on the first launch, although I still couldn't access the advanced settings afterward. The game is generally poorly optimized, with noticeable lags every time I navigate through the menu items.

The controls are very unresponsive—the car slides along the road like a box of naswar in the developer's pocket, but at the same time, it feels glued to the track surface and is very reluctant to respond to your steering attempts. At the same time, as soon as a collision occurs, the car will launch into near-Earth orbit, spinning around its axis, but the chance of this happening is only 50/50 with each collision with a foreign object.

Graphics. I'm not one to criticize a game for poor graphics, because it can always be played up with style and give the game a certain retro charm. Even without that, I almost never have complaints about a game with a clear lack of anti-aliasing or poorly executed effects. However... When I set the settings to ""ultra"" and see some kind of ""jaggy"" blur, I have questions, because a 2011 game looks like a console/mobile port of an obscure low-budget game.

There's no career mode, as far as I know. Instead, we'll be treated to a series of challenges (50 in total) and other game modes, each of which can apparently be customized by selecting the number of opponents, laps, and other attributes. There's no tuning; sometimes you can only select ready-made presets for specific tasks. Although the car's parameters are specified, you're not shown how they change depending on the tuning selected...

What modes are there in the game?

A regular race
- Derby (for some reason, divided into two types: large and small)
- ""Find and destroy something on a big truck""
- Bolt racing
- Night racing in rain and fog
- Off-roading with no rules, but with scoring for certain actions
- Driving along a route with zombies that you have to knock down to earn points
- Stunts where you can't even control the driver's ""launch"" (in previous games, the game showed the ""throw"" angle and slowed down time for accuracy, but this is not the case here)

The game doesn't remember camera settings between races, although this was the case in the previous two games. It's a small thing, but annoying.

The game also calculates stats rather strangely, which might have something to do with the metric system, but I'm not sure. For example, your 2-meter jump might be displayed as a 20-meter jump. This probably doesn't matter, but it struck me as odd, so I decided to point it out.

Verdict: Not worth your attention (and certainly not your money).

201672590,russian,2025.07.08 04:43,❌,✅,0.572206378,5,"Прошёл игру полностью... не спрашивайте зачем.
Мне тяжело описать, как она играется, но в моём понимании очень похоже на то, как я в машинки играл в детском саду. Никакого драйва. Нет ощущения, что это гонки.

Машины взрываются и лопаются от любого встречного ветерка. Затем мгновенно возрождаются за спиной у лидера (Вас, потому что тут конкуренции нет вообще никакой), вне зависимости от местонахождения до этого, хоть в двух минутах позади ехали.

Трассы либо очень длинные и прямые, либо короткие и с постоянными поворотами в 90 градусов.

ИИ здесь нет. Есть заранее прописанные траектории по которым перемещаются машинки. Можно сбить любую машину и она будет стоять смотреть в стену. Например, есть пару гонок 1х1, где противник быстро стартует, затем резко входит в поворот 90 градусов буквально ложась на бок, не теряя скорости, едет дальше. Если не врезаться в него в момент поворота и не сбить с траектории, то у вас больше не будет шанса победить. Но если сбить - он никогда не сможет вас догнать.

Трюки в этой серии - вечная боль. Многие зависят только от удачи, например летать внутри сферы и пытаться взорвать сколько-то бочек, вот только если от любого взрыва вы полетите немного не в ту сторону - вам не пройти испытание.

Короче эта игра местами забавная,  но в 95% времени абсолютно унылое рандомное нечто. Это не гонки, хотя внешне вроде похожа.","I've completed the game... don't ask me why.
It's hard for me to describe how it plays, but to me, it's very similar to playing with cars in kindergarten. There's no thrill. It doesn't feel like a racing game.

Cars explode and burst from any oncoming wind. Then they instantly respawn behind the leader (you, because there's no competition here at all), regardless of their previous location, even if they were two minutes behind.

The tracks are either very long and straight, or short and full of 90-degree turns.

There's no AI here. There are predetermined trajectories for the cars to follow. You can hit any car, and it will stare at the wall. For example, there are a couple of 1v1 races where the opponent starts off fast, then abruptly takes a 90-degree turn, literally flipping onto its side without losing speed, and then continues on. If you don't hit him while he's turning and knock him off course, you'll never have a chance to win. But if you do, he'll never be able to catch up.

The stunts in this series are a constant pain. Many rely solely on luck, like flying inside a sphere and trying to blow up a few barrels, but if any explosion sends you flying slightly off-course, you'll fail the challenge.

In short, this game is fun in places, but 95% of the time it's a completely boring, random experience. It's not a racing game, even though it looks like one."

Вообще про физику хочется отдельно сказать. Ощущение, будто ты ездишь по рельсам, сцепление настолько нереалистичное, насколько это возможно.

Вместо карьерного режима набор каких-то мини-заездов, мини-игр, зомби режим (?!)

Яркий показатель некомпететности команды разработчиков, это 19 уровень. В игре появляется новинка, гонка на туристических автобусах (те, самые знаменитыедвухэтажные красные из Лондона). Все было бы круто, только вот карта с пропастью и трамплинами. А скорость автобуса ограничена и физически невозможно перепрыгнуть трамплин. Бот до бесконечности пытается это сделать, а у игрока три варианта:

1. Выключить, удалить и забыть об этом куске испражнения разработчиков
2. Развернуться и проехать круг задом-наперед, проехав до чекпоинта и сделать ресет
3. Поменять файл игры с аттрибутами автобуса, прибавив ему максимальную скорость

Я пошел по второму пути, но только из своего желания посмотреть все 40 уровней, но любому адекватному человеку советую либо воспользоваться первым способом, либо, что еще лучше, даже не устанавливать это позорище.

Худо-бедно, получилось пройти все 40 уровней, был рад закрыть для себя эту ужасную главу моего игрового пути и больше никогда не возвращаться. Очень жаль, что права на великую серию достались каким-то криворуким жадным олухам.

У игры один из худших рейтингов в стиме, что не может не радовать. Значит еще осталось чувство вкуса у нынешних геймеров.","What a disgrace. What this joke has to do with the Flatout series is beyond me. It's some kind of mobile port, with absolutely no physics or graphics.

I'd like to comment specifically on the physics. It feels like you're driving on rails; the grip is as unrealistic as possible.

Instead of a career mode, there are some mini-races, mini-games, a zombie mode (?!)

Level 19 is a clear indicator of the development team's incompetence. The game introduces a new feature: a tourist bus race (those famous red double-deckers from London). It would be great, except for the map with a chasm and ramps. The bus's speed is limited, and it's physically impossible to jump over the ramps. The bot keeps trying to do this, and the player has three options:

1. Turn off, delete, and forget about this piece of developer excrement.
2. Turn around and drive a circle backwards, reaching the checkpoint, and reset.
3. Edit the game file with the bus attributes, increasing its maximum speed.

I went with the second option, but only out of a desire to see all 40 levels, but I advise any sane person to either use the first option or, even better, not even install this disgrace.

At least, I managed to complete all 40 levels. I was glad to close this terrible chapter of my gaming journey and never return. It's a shame that the rights to this great series were acquired by some incompetent, greedy idiots.

The game has one of the worst ratings on Steam, which is good news. It means today's gamers still have a sense of taste."

The car designs are unlikely to win fans among the fully-sighted, and for the most part their handling is intolerable, but there are maybe one or two per class that drive ok and are usable. The physics are... strange, but you get used to them after a bit. Events are very highly configurable, you can choose everything from the number of laps to the number of opponents and even what car classes the opponents are allowed to drive- but despite this events still tend to be very short and difficulty is all over the shop from race to race.

The one event that does last a good amount of time is the derby events, which I would argue are the best part of the whole game despite the very simplistic AI which simply makes a beeline for the player (like the cops in Driver on the PS1) and the slightly glitchy score system that encourages you to rub up against opponents more than ram them at speed. It's pretty fun and each derby might last about 5 minutes until your car blows up, but there aren't very many of them.

The Speed and Splatout events are decent too, Speed basically being normal races with proper racetracks and formula-style cars; and Splatout being a zombies mode where you drive around the regular circuits trying to run over as many people as possible, and as these use Race, Speed and Derby maps there are a lot of them to work through.

The maps range from pretty decent in design, maybe a 6/10, to redefining the word pain (looking at you, Tatras Mountains), but you can't deny there's plenty of variety throughout your playthrough.

In my quest to get all achievements in my library this was next on my list. Finished in roughly 11 hours, and for a good hour or so was looking up how to beat some of the stuntman tracks. Apparently there is a control mechanic that is never explained or shown on screen for less than a milisecond. Turns out you can hit the eject key and get a jump mid air, imagine that.  This kind of constant trying to figure out stuff as I progressed was so annoying. I can tell that no testing went into seeing if everything can be completed. Example, there is a challenge where you have to drive a bus through the race track. Except the bus is so slow that a required jump in the track is impassable. So instead of driving the track like normal, you back track through the level to hit the required checkpoint, then drive back to the jump the other way around. The race is 3 laps so this took forever.

So as far as the gameplay goes. Its about what I expected from Flatout, except that quantity over quality doesn't work with the Flatout formula. The physics in this game are shit, that doesn't work well when the game is known for good crash physics.

I can plainly see this is a rushed shovelware game that left when it was deep in a beta state. Because who the crap decided that the tracks should be repeated about 5 times for ""different event types"". This got so repetitive and boring. Definition of milking what you have. 

Onto some more random notes I have. IF you intend on actually playing this game. DO THE CHALLENGES FIRST. 50 challenges that give you a preselected car and track setup. This helps alot when unlocking stuff because its a required mode to get all the achivements, and it gets you familiar with the tracks. The only good thing I can say is there are some funky options that allow you to make the game way faster to beat.

Use the Alarma Special car. Its the best car for handling. 

Some challenges and tracks require the speed to be set faster or classic rather than Default. This alludes to some of the options that can be set before you enter a race. There is a setting that can set how fast the gameplay/cars are. Yeah some fiddling was required in order to make it through some of the events.

Another bug, sometimes the AI can glitch and do an entire race with boost making it unwinnable, usually you can fix it by restarting the race. The AI will boost for a little when the race starts but I had about 40 times where the AIs boost never ran out so they just flew by never to be seen again.

The physics suck but some computers may benefit from disabling the multithreaded physics option in the menu. Apparently my computer is so beefy that the physics can break from how fast the physics calculations are handled. There is a setting in the options at the bottom to force the physics to run on a single core/thread only. 

Overall 3/10 Almost felt like playing Solitare, something so boring and mindless it sucks everything away until you realize you paid money to play this. Unless you happened to get this game with the Flatout bundle, which I hope is the only way this game makes it into peoples library.","tl;dr Get it on sale for less than a dollar if you want to experience the definition of mediocrity.

In my quest to get all achievements in my library this was next on my list. Finished in roughly 11 hours, and for a good hour or so was looking up how to beat some of the stuntman tracks. Apparently there is a control mechanic that is never explained or shown on screen for less than a milisecond. Turns out you can hit the eject key and get a jump mid air, imagine that.  This kind of constant trying to figure out stuff as I progressed was so annoying. I can tell that no testing went into seeing if everything can be completed. Example, there is a challenge where you have to drive a bus through the race track. Except the bus is so slow that a required jump in the track is impassable. So instead of driving the track like normal, you back track through the level to hit the required checkpoint, then drive back to the jump the other way around. The race is 3 laps so this took forever.

So as far as the gameplay goes. Its about what I expected from Flatout, except that quantity over quality doesn't work with the Flatout formula. The physics in this game are shit, that doesn't work well when the game is known for good crash physics.

I can plainly see this is a rushed shovelware game that left when it was deep in a beta state. Because who the crap decided that the tracks should be repeated about 5 times for ""different event types"". This got so repetitive and boring. Definition of milking what you have. 

Onto some more random notes I have. IF you intend on actually playing this game. DO THE CHALLENGES FIRST. 50 challenges that give you a preselected car and track setup. This helps alot when unlocking stuff because its a required mode to get all the achivements, and it gets you familiar with the tracks. The only good thing I can say is there are some funky options that allow you to make the game way faster to beat.

Графіка і артдизайн

Піздець. Графіка схожа на флеш-ігри з 2005 року. Машини виглядають так, ніби їх моделювали в Paint 3D з зав’язаними очима. 

Атмосфера

Яка нахуй атмосфера? Тут атмосфери стільки ж, скільки душі в лопаті. У FlatOut 2 ти відчував драйв, розгром, м’ясо, кайф. Тут — тиша, порожнеча і відчуття, що тебе обісрали за твої ж гроші.

Геймплей

Це просто їбучий цирк. Машини поводять себе як зневажені собаки з судомами. Керування — це жах. Граєш — і не розумієш, чи ти в гонці, чи в мильній опері з епілепсією. У кожному заїзді якась хуйня: тебе викидає в небо, провалюєшся під землю, ШІ їде боком по вертикальній стіні.
Фізика? Та яка в сраку фізика?! Це навіть не аркада — це клятий баг-фест із синдромом турбулентного лайна.

Ця гра — це одна велика технічна проблема. Фрізи, баги, вилітання, меню лагає, машини зависають в текстурах, ворожі боти поводяться як мудаки з тремором.

Le comble de l’ironie, c’est qu’il n’a guère de terres désolées, et encore moins dans la capitale américaine, là où l’analogie à la troisième retombée radioactive guette l’œil des plus perspicaces — ou des psychotiques non loin des poubelles du Franprix de Sarcelles.

Je suis Fabrice Poisson-Oméga, et du haut de mes 38 ans, je croque la vie à pleines dents ! Je fais des études sociologiques sur moult expériences vidéoludiques pour l’épatement personnel de moi-même. Et vous savez quoi ? C’est unanime !

Alors, ayez de grâce… et respectez ma vie ? Je suis en peignoir, actuellement, en train de siroter mon thé à la camomille mélangé à de la vodka rose, avec un brin de Coca-Cola à la vanille. Et je me sens confus… mais également heureux !

Heureux, parce qu’avec cette substance thérapeutique, j'ai eu l'audace d'acheter un beau livre qui émane la vérité dure : le DSM III. Je reçois fort bientôt ce dernier par l'intermédiaire d'un casier Mondial Relay, là ou séjourne des comateux en quête de V-Bucks et autres 8.6 tiède.

Le DSM III serait apparemment une ode à l'aventure, à l'occultisme sans une once de bavardage fiévreux. Ce qui faut comprendre, c'est qu'il est supérieur au catalogue de E.L James ! 

Et lors de cette commande fortuite faite sur Rakuten, j'ai lu un avis qui m'a fait un rapprochement vis à vis de FlatOut 3, allant visiter des forums obscurs des années 2000, regroupant chaque information afin de mieux comprendre la petite bête dans la cochenille des M&M's...

Sociologiquement parlant, des milliers d'anthropologues de l'industrie néo-chocolatière de la Roumanie du sud-est ont émis l'hypothèse que ce jeu crée un ""dégoût subjectif"" et que les avis négatifs sont le fruit d'un mécanisme de défense vis-à-vis d'une réalité qui provoque une confusion énorme au niveau de l'abdomen des poumons du cerveau, soit l'amygdale de l'extrême gauche à l'étalon du postérieur de la matière grise de la zone B. Jusqu'ici tout me semble clair.

De ce fait, le.a joueur.euse hurle en sanglots et tente de fuir le jeu coûte que coûte. À savoir que des intellectuels de Saint-Marin estiment qu'un fort taux de radon peut causer des symptômes tels que la détresse, la colère, le dégoût et un besoin subjectif d'avoir une réponse claire, fort similaire à la paranoïa aiguë.

Et j'approuve ces théories car l'équipe de Team6 a réussi à développer le jeu sans partir en vrille, et ils semblent être fiers de leur œuvre, et c'est tout à leur honneur.

La fuite est en somme subjective.

Mais moi, est-ce que je fuis FlatOut 3 ?
Ses rues, qui rendent hommage à la ville sécuritaire du Michigan, me laissent dénué de pistache : je ressens la sensibilité d’un goudron huilé par la coquette pluie qui embrasse le vent d’un Marshall Mathers, avouant son erreur de ne s'être excusé auprès du king du hip-hop : Benzino.

C’est un bien-être qui s’installe, et la jouabilité nous l’invite naturellement, comme si Team6 avait ouvert le DSM-III et incorporé, sans concession, chaque diagnostic, afin que chaque humain, clodo, cheval, capybara, et taré des caniveaux hurle en sanglots face à la réponse d’une vie : se prendre une étiquette dans la tronche.

Face à cette révélation, sous les couleurs de cette œuvre, j’ai couru vers ma mère pour avouer qui j’étais, le pourquoi du comment, ma différence.

J’ai descendu les escaliers. Ma génitrice était à la cuisine, en train de préparer un gâteau au yaourt. J’ai aussitôt exclamé, en levant mon annulaire du centre :

""Mère, c’est avec grâce que, sous mon peignoir en satin pourpre doré, je fais appel à ta trachée et tes pupilles pour analyser ce qui va suivre.
FlatOut 3, un jeu de course développé par Team6, m’a fait voir une lumière invisible, qui ne se trouve qu’au sein de mon corps et de mon esprit. Et je t’en conjure, c’est complexe d’en parler, car j’ai peur que tu sanglotes.
Je suis ton fils, et tu dois comprendre que le bitume huilé par la coquette pluie m’a ainsi mis, sur mon palpable front, une étiquette…
Mère, j’ai le TSA de niveau 1, soit le Trouble du Spectre Angulaire.
Et avant que tu me fasses une étreinte d’empathie : ce n’est pas une maladie, mais une différence. Une différence qui me permet de ne pas être victime d'une fuite panique subjective : je peux consommer le jeu sans dégoût, le savourer sans concession tel qu'il est. Alors sois indulgente envers moi. Je le sais, car c’est unanime !""

Ma génitrice, du haut de ses 68 ans, a développé un regard de terreur, le tout avec des tremblements, comme si elle avait lu une œuvre de E. L. James, avant de baisser les yeux et de sortir de sa bouche :

""Mais… mais Fabrice, y’a quoi qui cloche dans ta tête ?!
J’ai rien capté à tes propos et… et… Et puis... ahh ! Regarde-toi : tu portes des lunettes de soleil à la maison, un t-shirt Lionel Jospin 2002 qui sent je ne sais pas trop quoi, et… par pitié, va mettre un slip !""

Je tremblais d’incompréhension. J’ai fait un meltdown angulaire :

""Jeeeee… C’est… haha… euh… JE SUIS ANGULAIRE, MAMAN ! TU CAPTES OU PAS ?!
OUI, JE SAIS, JE SUIS DIFFÉRENT, MAIS CE N’EST PAS UNE MALADIE… JE DÉTIENS LA VÉRITÉ OBJECTIVE SELON LA VISION DE TEAM6...""

Je souffle, puis reprends :

""Et pour le slip… c’était la volonté du bitume du Michigan. De la coquette… machin chose.""

Sans comprendre son comportement d’hystérique d’un autre temps, je l’ai vue sangloter avant de sortir un Coteaux de Montélimar, cuvée 2015.

Peut-être savoure-t-elle ma différence ?
Va-t-elle s’excuser de son comportement atypique ?
Elle est peut-être neurotypique… mais moi… moi, je suis neuroangulaire, et il faut l’accepter.

Que ses sanglots l’embarquent dans les contrées de Team6, et peut-être qu’elle verra qui je suis — avec une lucidité scandaleuse à l’odeur d’un monde empathique de compréhension mondaine.

Merci, FlatOut 3.
Tu es venu quand il me manquait un élément crucial pour que ma santé mentale soit propre : l’angulaire.

Pour aller plus loin : https://steamcommunity.com/id/Yzsatis/recommended/2613400/","FlatOut 3… a title that evokes a sense of desolation and apocalypse in millions of people on Earth, as well as in the distant lands of Andromeda and beyond!

The irony is that there are hardly any desolate lands, and even fewer in the American capital, where the analogy to the third radioactive fallout catches the eye of the most perceptive—or of the psychotic not far from the garbage cans at the Franprix store in Sarcelles.

I'm Fabrice Poisson-Oméga, and at 38 years old, I live life to the fullest! I'm conducting sociological studies on numerous video game experiences for my own personal amazement. And you know what? It's unanimous!

So, have some mercy… and respect my life? I'm currently in my bathrobe, sipping chamomile tea mixed with pink vodka, with a dash of vanilla Coca-Cola. And I feel confused... but also happy!

Happy, because with this therapeutic substance, I had the audacity to buy a beautiful book that emanates the harsh truth: the DSM III. I'll be receiving it very soon via a Mondial Relay locker, where comatose people in search of V-Bucks and other lukewarm 8.6s stay.

The DSM III is apparently an ode to adventure and the occult without a hint of feverish chatter. What you have to understand is that it's superior to E.L. James's catalog!

And during this random order on Rakuten, I read a review that made me think of FlatOut 3, visiting obscure forums from the 2000s, gathering every piece of information to better understand the little beast in the M&M's cochineal...

Sociologically speaking, thousands of anthropologists from the neo-chocolate industry in southeastern Romania have hypothesized that this game creates a ""subjective disgust"" and that the negative reviews are the result of a defense mechanism against a reality that causes enormous confusion in the abdomen of the lungs of the brain, that is, the amygdala from the far left to the posterior standard of the gray matter of zone B. So far, everything seems clear to me.

As a result, the player screams and sobs and tries to escape the game at all costs. Namely, intellectuals in San Marino believe that high radon levels can cause symptoms such as distress, anger, disgust, and a subjective need for a clear answer, very similar to acute paranoia.

And I agree with these theories because the Team6 team managed to develop the game without going off the rails, and they seem to be proud of their work, which is to their credit.

Escape is ultimately subjective.

But am I escaping FlatOut 3?

Its streets, which pay homage to the safe Michigan city, leave me devoid of pistachio: I feel the sensitivity of a tarmac oiled by the coquettish rain that embraces the wind of a Marshall Mathers, admitting his mistake of not apologizing to the king of hip-hop: Benzino.

A sense of well-being sets in, and the gameplay naturally invites it, as if Team6 had opened the DSM-III and incorporated, without compromise, each diagnosis, so that every human, homeless person, horse, capybara, and gutter freak would cry out in tears at the answer of a lifetime: getting labeled.

Faced with this revelation, under the colors of this work, I ran to my mother to confess who I was, the why and how, my difference.

I went down the stairs. My mother was in the kitchen, making a yogurt cake. I immediately exclaimed, raising my ring finger from the center:

""Mother, it is with grace that, beneath my purple-gold satin bathrobe, I call upon your trachea and your pupils to analyze what is to follow.
FlatOut 3, a racing game developed by Team6, made me see an invisible light, which is found only within my body and my mind. And I beg you, it's difficult to talk about it, because I'm afraid you'll sob.
I am your son, and you must understand that the asphalt, oiled by the coquettish rain, has thus placed a label on my palpable forehead...
Mother, I have ASD Level 1, or Angular Spectrum Disorder.
And before you give me a hug of empathy: it's not an illness, but a difference. A difference that allows me to avoid falling victim to subjective panic flight: I can consume the game without disgust, savor it uncompromisingly as it is. So be indulgent with me. I know, because it's unanimous!""

My mother, at 68 years old, developed a look of terror, all trembling, as if she'd read a work by E. L. James, before lowering her eyes and blurting out:

""But... but Fabrice, what's wrong with your head?!
I didn't understand a word you were saying and... and... And then... ahh! Look at you: you're wearing sunglasses at home, a Lionel Jospin 2002 t-shirt that smells of I don't really know what, and... please, go put on some underwear!""

I was trembling with incomprehension. I had an angular meltdown:

""Jeeeee… It's… haha… uh… I'M ANGULAR, MOM! DO YOU GET IT OR NOT?!
YES, I KNOW, I'M DIFFERENT, BUT IT'S NOT A DISEASE… I HAVE THE OBJECTIVE TRUTH ACCORDING TO TEAM6'S VISION...""

I sigh, then continue:

""And as for the underwear… it was the will of the Michigan asphalt. Flirty… thingamajig.""

Without understanding her hysterical behavior from another era, I saw her sob before pulling out a Coteaux de Montélimar, 2015 vintage.

Perhaps she savors my difference?
Will she apologize for her atypical behavior?
She may be neurotypical… but me… I'm neuroangular, and you have to accept that.

May her sobs carry her away to the lands of Team6, and perhaps she'll see who I am—with a scandalous lucidity that smells of an empathetic world of mundane understanding.

Thank you, FlatOut 3.
You came when I was missing a crucial element to clean up my sanity: the angular.

🏎️ Une physique révolutionnaire

La physique de FlatOut 3 ? Un chef-d’œuvre d'avant-garde. On dirait que chaque voiture a été remplie de gelée et posée sur des patins à glace. C’est pas une conduite approximative, non : c’est un hommage vibrant à la gravité... version Looney Tunes. Chaque virage est une expérience métaphysique. Chaque collision est une lettre d’amour envoyée à la NASA, mais avec les pieds.
🤖 Une IA qui pense... différemment

L’intelligence artificielle ? Une œuvre d’art conceptuelle. Ici, les pilotes ne cherchent pas à gagner — ce serait trop simple — ils cherchent à vivre une aventure intérieure. Tantôt suicidaires, tantôt complètement figés dans une transe numérique, ces adversaires sont des philosophes en pleine introspection. ""Et si, au lieu de finir la course, je fonçais droit dans un mur à pleine vitesse ?"" Une question existentielle que seule l’IA de FlatOut 3 ose poser.
🎨 Des graphismes dignes des plus grands jeux… de 2002

Quel audace visuelle ! FlatOut 3 ne s’embarrasse pas de fioritures modernes. Le jeu propose une esthétique brute, presque primitive. Certains diraient ""moche"", mais non : c’est du post-rétro-industrialisme pixelisé. Des textures floues ? Non, c’est de l’art abstrait. Un framerate qui tremble ? Une immersion dans l’angoisse contemporaine. On n’est pas là pour être confortables, on est là pour ressentir.
🔊 Une ambiance sonore... inoubliable

Des bruits de moteur dignes d’un mixeur de cuisine, des musiques qu’on jurerait sorties d’un CD de démos gratuites, et des cris humains dont l’origine semble incertaine (est-ce une douleur réelle ou une performance d'acteur ratée ?)... Un cocktail sonore détonnant ! C’est un peu comme si FlatOut 3 avait voulu faire un album conceptuel sur la folie mécanique.
💥 Un chaos total — donc fidèle à son titre

Fidèle à son nom, Chaos & Destruction, le jeu te promet un bordel total, et il livre. Tu ne contrôles pas une voiture, tu participes à une expérience chaotique sur le sens même de la course. C’est pas un jeu, c’est un manifeste anti-course. Une ode à l’anarchie sur quatre roues. Mario Kart pour les gens qui veulent souffrir.
🧠 Un jeu qui reste gravé dans la mémoire

Soyons honnêtes : tu oublieras peut-être le nom de ton premier amour, mais FlatOut 3, lui, tu n’oublieras jamais. C’est une cicatrice numérique. Une fois que tu l’as lancé, il fait partie de toi. Comme un tatouage mal fait ou un plat trop épicé que tu regrettes immédiatement mais que tu racontes pendant des années.
🏁 En résumé

FlatOut 3 est un jeu visionnaire, dans le sens où il t’ouvre les yeux... sur ce qu’un jeu ne doit jamais être. Mais grâce à lui, tu apprécieras tous les autres jeux de course. Même ceux faits en une semaine par trois stagiaires sous Excel te sembleront des chefs-d’œuvre après ça.

The physics of FlatOut 3? A cutting-edge masterpiece. It's as if every car has been filled with jelly and placed on ice skates. This isn't rough driving, no: it's a vibrant homage to gravity...

Artificial intelligence? A work of conceptual art. Here, the drivers aren't looking to win—that would be too simple—they're looking to experience an inner adventure. Sometimes suicidal, sometimes completely frozen in a digital trance, these opponents are philosophers deep in introspection. ""What if, instead of finishing the race, I drove straight into a wall at full speed?"" An existential question that only FlatOut 3's AI dares to ask.
🎨 Graphics worthy of the greatest games... from 2002

What visual audacity! FlatOut 3 doesn't bother with modern flourishes. The game offers a raw, almost primitive aesthetic. Some might say ""ugly,"" but no: it's pixelated post-retro-industrialism. Blurry textures? No, it's abstract art. A shaky framerate? An immersion in contemporary angst. We're not here to be comfortable, we're here to feel. 🔊 An unforgettable soundscape

Engine sounds worthy of a kitchen blender, music that sounds like it came from a free demo CD, and human screams whose origin seems uncertain (is it real pain or a failed acting performance?)... An explosive sound cocktail! It's a bit like FlatOut 3 wanted to make a concept album about mechanical madness.
💥 Total chaos — true to its title

True to its name, Chaos & Destruction, the game promises total chaos, and it delivers. You don't control a car; you participate in a chaotic experience about the very meaning of racing. It's not a game, it's an anti-racing manifesto. An ode to anarchy on four wheels. Mario Kart for people who want to suffer. 🧠 A game that stays etched in your memory

Let's be honest: you might forget the name of your first love, but FlatOut 3, you'll never forget. It's a digital scar. Once you start it, it becomes part of you. Like a poorly done tattoo or an overly spicy dish that you immediately regret but talk about for years to come.
🏁 In summary

FlatOut 3 is a visionary game, in the sense that it opens your eyes... to what a game should never be. But thanks to it, you'll appreciate all other racing games. Even those made in a week by three interns using Excel will seem like masterpieces afterward.

Rating: 10/10. A misunderstood masterpiece. Worth showing at game design schools."

BUT! (and thus my thumbs up to have your attention :)
It's UNDONE. It's ALPHA, in fact. It was half-baked and released out of financial pit.

I'd say it doesn't deserve its absolute hate that it received at the release. There are many signs of a larger and better game as it was actually planned to be. Unfortunately, due to troubles with publishers, the development was stopped at a random point, everything was packed into a playable game as-is and released abruptly, and then, mostly due to being named as a sequel to beloved FlatOut series, it was absolutely destroyed by critics.

But here's what it actually has:
— a lot of cars
— a lot of tracks
— a lot of carefully designed characters
— a lot of game mechanics
— a variety of game modes
— a lot of sounds and special effects / interactive objects on tracks
— a short, but nice licensed soundtrack — however, due to a small flaw in settings menu, many players didn't know about it and couldn't hear it at all :P

And that's where it all falls apart:
— game mechanics being undone / unbalanced / dropped at all, like monster truck missions where failure is treated as a success, or splatout mode which looks and feels empty like something at the very first days of its development
— physics and collisions are all over the place, damage (both dealt and received) seems totally random and unrelated to neither speed nor point of impact
— cars being barely different from each other except maybe their size, and concept of different characters is not utilized at all
— bugged / undone interactive objects on tracks, possible crashes to desktop on restarts
— pretty basic AI which can often find itself driving in circles at one point
— unresponsive / non-working controls at times
— overall feeling that everything is in draft / alpha / tech demo / testing state, including the overall game progression and winning conditions

You see, all these issues might be resolved with just more time and budget to finish everything that was initially planned for the game, but the real life decided otherwise.

However, if we return to the fact that this was set up as a sequel to FlatOut by Bugbear, I'd honestly say that Team 6 Studios couldn't have reached the same level even if they were allowed to complete the development properly. They are obviously smaller, less skilled (and paid) with much more dated game engine than even the original one, so even in its best state the game would receive 5-6 stars out of 10, in my opinion. But that's how their previous games were also rated, and they were OK with that. For us, the game would have been at least much more fun to play.

In summary, I wouldn't honestly recommend this game to anyone, BUT.

If you just imagined that this has never been released commercially, but uploaded freely to the web as ""unfinished playable alpha of FlatOut 2 sequel that was cancelled 15 years ago due to financial problems"", you would definitely look at this game from a different perspective, more curious and closer to the reality, to be honest.

And, given the source code and/or proper modding tools, it could've even become a great community-driven game like, say, Unreal Tournament 4.

It's a shame that this will never happen.","By no means it's a good game, it's 3 stars out of 10 at best in its current state.

1, ГРАФИКА, Она здесь какая-то пластилиновая короче говно, 
2, РАЗРУШЕНИЕ МАШИН, Я хвалил первую и вторую часть за то что там разрушение машин проработано просто ахуительно там можно было так распидорасить машину и это смотрелось красиво а тут разрушение деградировало так плюсом графон пластилиновый это смотрится в двойне плохо 
3, УПРАВЛЕНИЕ СТРЕЛОЧКАМИ, Начнём с того что для первой части это простительно ведь игра 2003 года и это норма для тех лет, Вот уже во второй части это смотрелось странно, но сука в третей части 2011 года это уже раздражает, Так даже это нельзя поменять в настройках или это у вас блять традиция?
4, КАРТЫ, Они такие скучные и неинтересные так ещё плюсом этот уёбский мутный фильтр который делает все карты однотипными,
5,МЫЛО, Сука всё такое мыльное что пизда в предыдущих честях такого не было,\

Плюсов в этой игре нет это просто кусок разочарования, Но этому есть оправдание игру делали не те разрабы которые работали над первой и второй частью веть это была первая их крупная работа и он как уже видно всё проебали","I'll start right off the bat. I didn't like the game at all. For the following reasons:
1. GRAPHICS. They're just so plasticine-y, crap.
2. CAR DESTRUCTION. I praised the first and second games for their incredibly well-designed car destruction. You could really screw up a car there and it looked beautiful, but here the destruction has degraded so much. Plus, the graphics are like plasticine, it looks doubly bad.
3. ARROW CONTROLS. Let's start with the fact that for the first game, this is forgivable, since it's a 2003 game and that's the norm for those years. It already looked weird in the second game, but in the third game from 2011, it's already annoying. Can't you even change this in the settings, or is this some fucking tradition?
4. MAPS, They're so boring and uninteresting, plus there's this fucking murky filter that makes all the maps look the same.
5. SOAP, Fuck, everything's so soapy it's fucking impossible. I didn't see anything like this in the previous games.
I don't think I forgot anything.
There are no advantages to this game; it's just a shambles of disappointment. But there's an excuse: the game wasn't made by the same developers who worked on the first and second games, because this was their first major project, and, as you can see, they screwed everything up."

Выходцы из ""Team 6"" разрабатывающей данную часть рассказывали позже об удручающей обстановке во время разработки, как они буквально ""за еду"" создавали видеоигру, а глава компании месяцами не выплачивал себе зарплату, так как денег у издателя практически не было. По этому, результат в виде худшей части в серии и впринципе видеоигры в истории, которую лучше бы не создавали вообще, становится очевидным. И видимо осозновая тот ужас, что сотворили, разработчики решили заботливо ввести облегчающие прохождение функции в виде настройки каждого заезда, например, выставив 1 круг в гонке для победы и возможность ускорить игровой процесс. Видеоигра не может порадовать абсолютно ничем, движок устаревший, ведь у команды разработчика не было денег на современный, игровой процесс не увлекает, управление машиной не вызывает удовольствие, даже ""ИИ"" в некоторых заездах не может адекватно проехать задуманную трассу разработчиками, например, как в испытании с ""двухэтажными автобусами из Лондона"". Автопарк из множества тачек разных видов, но, они по ощущениям - все, как одна. Чуть различаясь во время установки тюнинга. Драйвовых песен от культовых исполнителей не завезли, вместо них невзрачный саундтрек, который надоедает спустя 5 минут и порой приятнее игралось без звука. Ведь и сам звук окружения посредственный. Главная фишка серии ""Flatout"" в виде ""каскадёрских трюков"", что были достаточно интересно исполнены в первых 2-х частях, здесь совсем не увлекательно играются. Если бы не моё желание пройти все части серии, не смотря на поршивость и достижения, то я бы наверное так и закинул спустя первых 10 минут игры, а так, пойдёт для ""убийства времени"" и под определённое настроение. Хотя, нет...","This isn't ""Flatout."" Unfortunately, this video game is only connected to the legendary first two installments in the series by name. Former members of Team 6, the developers of this game, later described the depressing environment during development, how they literally created the game for scraps, while the head of the company went months without paying himself because the publisher had virtually no money. Therefore, the result—the worst game in the series and, in essence, a video game in history that should have never been created—is obvious. Apparently aware of the horror they created, the developers thoughtfully decided to introduce features to make progress easier, such as customization options for each race, such as a one-lap win limit and the ability to speed up the gameplay. The video game offers absolutely nothing to delight. The engine is outdated, as the development team didn't have the money for a modern one. The gameplay is unengaging, the driving is unsatisfactory, and even the AI ​​can't adequately navigate the tracks the developers designed in some races, such as the ""London double-decker bus"" challenge. The fleet consists of numerous cars of various types, but they all feel identical, with slight variations depending on the tuning. There are no upbeat songs from iconic artists, but instead a bland soundtrack that gets boring after five minutes, and sometimes it's more enjoyable to play without sound. The ambient sound itself is mediocre. The main draw of the Flatout series, the stunts that were quite engaging in the first two games, are not at all engaging here. If it weren't for my desire to play through every game in the series, regardless of the grind and achievements, I probably would have given up after the first 10 minutes. But otherwise, it's a good time-killer and suits the right mood. Actually, no..."

- die Grafik ist schlechter als bei Flatout 2
- die Schadensmodelle der Fahrzeuge für den Allerwertesten
- die (Fahr)physik, welche immer ein Augenmerk von Flatout war, ist unter aller Kanone

Das Spiel fühlt sich für mich mehr wie ein frühes Need for Speed an, bei dem man ein bisschen Fahrzeugschaden eingebaut hat. Man kann mit 200 problemlos lenken und kommt locker durch Kurven oder den Rasen.

- the graphics are worse than in Flatout 2

Ну что же... 12 часов сущего ада закончились, теперь можно и поделиться своими эмоциями об этой игре. Если вы играли с первую часть FlatOut, или может быть во вторую, то пожалуйста, не заходите вообще сюда, я вас умоляю. Здесь даже не о чем говорить, Разработчики решили разнообразить свою игру, добавили много ненужных режимов, например ночные гонки с более сложными соперниками, гонки 1v1, обычные гонки, командные игры 2v2, в которой нужно ""собирать"" уже взорванные и расставленные автомобили или бочки, режим по бездорожью, сбивание зомби и возможно что-то ещё. Жалко, что нет ответа на вопрос ""А зачем это всё?"". Потому что взамен множества режимов мы получили отвратительную физику ""картонных автомобилей"", саундтрек, после которого из ушей льется кровь(да, здесь нет прямой вины разработчиков, но...), непроработанные карты, по которым просто скучно ездить, откровенно тупой ИИ, то есть буквально здесь 2 варианта событий, либо это гонщики Формулы-1, которые знают карту как свои 10 пальцев, либо сельские подростки, которые путают газ и тормоз. А что насчёт режима ""Испытания"", который насчитывает 50 различных вариаций гонок? Дело в том, что в одном из этих испытаний, а именно в 19, мы вместе с нашим соперником сядем за лондонские двухэтажные автобусы, чтобы выявить победителя. Вроде бы круто, но есть один недочёт. Во время гонки есть перелёт через пропасть, перед которым надо круто так разогнаться. А вот и нет, во-первых не хватает мощностей для автобуса, а во-вторых он замедляется при приближении к подъёму перед пропастью. И что же делать? А надо просто развернуться, доехать до обратной стороны пропасти, взять контрольную точку и вернуться обратно. И так сделать 3 круга, весело, не так ли? Также есть вопрос к достижению, в котором требуется уничтожить 10.000 зомби, просто дело в том, что в среднем за гонку удаётся задавить около 150 зомби. А значит, нам потребуется около 60 однообразных и скучнейших гонок, чтобы выполнить это достижение. И стоит признаться, что я просто устал играть в эту ""недоигру"", что я скачал 2 сохранения на последнее испытание и 10.000 зомби. И я не жалею, что поступил именно так. За что можно поставить два балла этой игре? Накидываю балл за то, что это чудовище просто запускается, и ещё один за то, что это часть легендарной серии FlatOut...только так...","Rating: 2/10
Well then... 12 hours of pure hell are over, now I can share my impressions of this game. If you played the first FlatOut, or maybe the second, please don't come here at all, I beg you. There's nothing to talk about here. The developers decided to diversify their game by adding a bunch of unnecessary modes, like night races with more challenging opponents, 1v1 races, regular races, 2v2 team games where you have to ""collect"" already blown up and placed cars or barrels, an off-road mode, zombie shooting, and maybe something else. It's a shame there's no answer to the question, ""What's all this for?"" Because in exchange for a multitude of modes, we got terrible ""cardboard car"" physics, a soundtrack that makes your ears bleed (yes, this isn't the developers' fault, but...), poorly designed maps that are simply boring to drive, and frankly stupid AI—meaning there are literally only two outcomes: either Formula 1 drivers who know the map like the back of their hand, or rural teenagers who confuse the gas and brake. And what about the ""Challenges"" mode, which features 50 different race variations? The thing is, in one of these challenges, number 19 to be exact, we'll be driving London double-decker buses with our opponent to determine the winner. It seems cool, but there's one flaw. During the race, there's a jump over a chasm that requires a massive acceleration boost. But no, firstly, the bus doesn't have enough power, and secondly, it slows down as it approaches the incline before the chasm. So what do you do? Just turn around, drive to the other side of the chasm, take the checkpoint, and head back. And do three laps like that—fun, right? There's also the issue with the achievement that requires you to destroy 10,000 zombies. The thing is, on average, you only get to run over about 150 zombies per race. That means we'll need about 60 monotonous and boring races to complete it. And I have to admit, I'm simply tired of playing this ""half-assed game,"" downloading two saves for the final challenge and 10,000 zombies. And I don't regret doing just that. Why give this game two stars? I'll give it a point for the fact that this monster starts up so easily, and another one for being part of the legendary FlatOut series...that's all there is to it..."

 Начну с наверное самых смешных негативных моментов игры (опустим физику и разрушаемость машин, это больное место игры, особенно после прошлых частей, но в целом с пивом пойдет, с балтикой 9, с пятью банками, после литра водки...). В половине режимов не хватает мини-карты, а там где она есть она не информативна ВООБЩЕ, на ней буквально дороги не сходятся с тем что ты  ̶в̶и̶д̶и̶ш̶ь̶ НЕ ВИДИШЬ на экране. Тут мы переходим ко второму приколу, к камере на уровне заднего бампера, я просто спрошу нахрена? Да, камеру можно отдалить, но по невероятному стечению обстоятельств это нужно делать при запуске каждой гребаной гонки. Пройдемся по трюкам. они сделаны просто плохо, зачастую тебе непонятна задача которая стоит перед тобой и хоть както осознано запустить водителя просто невозможно. Искусственный интилект во всех режимах кроме обычных гонок просто отсутствует, болванчикам банально не прописали задачу, к примеру, есть режим где нужно разрушать объекты и получать очки, к концу заезда счет ботов близится к нулю, изза чего сложность как и он близится туда же.
 Теперь перейдем к самому важному, КАК ПОЛУЧИТЬ ОТ ЭТОЙ ИГРЫ УДОВОЛЬСТВИЕ. Из-за того, что есть довольно прикольные режимы, я, предлагаю вам собрать пачку друзей которые как и вы приобрели эту игру в бандле с первыми частями и просто поиграть в это... Я вам гарантирую, вы поймаете некий прикол, посмеетесь с того что сделано плохо, повеселитись в режимах которые более менее доделаны (не запускайте дерби, все остальное в целом играбельно). Ну и главное, на 2 часа которые вы в ней проведете забудьте о том, что это Flatout, представьте что это:""Мед макс: Дорога на Казантип 2007"". Ах, да, и выключите все звуки в игре как только ее запустите, я вас предупредил. Удачи на дорогах, надеюсь я подкинул идейку для вашей компании на вечер.","So, for some reason, I finished this, dare I say it, ""game."" I'll express an unpopular opinion: Flatout 3 is still a complete piece of crap, BUT I did enjoy it somewhat. 
I'll start with what I think are the funniest negative aspects of the game (let's skip the physics and car destructibility; it's a sore spot, especially after the previous games, but overall, it's fine with a beer, a Baltika 9, five cans, a liter of vodka...). Half the modes lack a minimap, and where it exists, it's not informative at all; the roads literally don't converge with what you ̶s̶e̶d̶i̶n̶t̶e̶ on the screen. This brings us to the second joke: the camera at rear bumper level. I'm just asking, why the hell? Yes, you can zoom out, but by some incredible coincidence, you have to do this every time you start a race. Let's talk about the stunts. They're simply poorly designed; you often don't understand the task at hand, and it's simply impossible to consciously engage the driver. Artificial intelligence is simply nonexistent in all modes except regular races; the dummies simply haven't been given a task. For example, there's a mode where you have to destroy objects and earn points. By the end of the race, the bots' scores are approaching zero, which causes the difficulty to drop as well.
Now let's move on to the most important thing: HOW TO ENJOY THIS GAME. Because there are some pretty cool modes, I suggest you gather a group of friends who, like you, bought this game in the bundle with the first games and just play it. I guarantee you'll find some humor, laugh at the poorly executed ones, and have fun with the more or less polished modes (don't try the derby mode; everything else is generally playable). And most importantly, for the two hours you spend playing it, forget that it's Flatout and imagine it as ""Med Max: Road to Kazantip 2007."" Oh, and turn off all the sounds in the game as soon as you launch it, I warned you. Good luck on the road, I hope I've given you an idea for your company for the evening."

Нет, серьёзно — всё. Управление будто ты пытаешься рулить диваном, который скользит по льду. Машины не едут, а мучаются. Физика? Ну, если под ""физикой"" вы понимаете катапульту в ад — то да, она есть.

Графика — это отдельный уровень боли. Порой казалось, что я случайно запустил демку с 2002 года, но даже там, наверно, цвета подбирали с чуть большим уважением к сетчатке глаза.

Почему я всё-таки прошёл эту игру? Да потому что в глубине души я — ачив-хантер, и мне нужна была эта чёртова платина. Так что да, я страдал, но с определённой целью. Можно сказать, я прошёл FlatOut 3 не потому что хотел, а потому что должен был.

Well, if by ""physics"" you mean a catapult to hell, then yes, they have them.

The graphics are a whole other level of pain. Sometimes it felt like I'd accidentally launched a demo from 2002, but even there, the colors were probably chosen with a little more respect for the retina.

Why did I actually beat that game? Because deep down, I'm an achievement hunter, and I needed that damn platinum. So yes, I suffered, but with a purpose. You could say I finished FlatOut 3 not because I wanted to, but because I had to.

Hier ein Beispiel: Ich fahre ein Rennen und bin uneinholbar vorne. Urplötzlich erscheint ein Gegner auf dem Radar direkt hinter mir. Dann sobald ein Gegner den Spieler überholt, wird er total schlecht und fährt in Hindernisse oder in die Wand, dass man direkt wieder zurück überholen kann. Sobald der Spieler wieder vorne ist, kann der eben überholte wieder fahren wie ein Gott, bis er den Spieler wieder überholt. Und so weiter und so weiter. Sehr ermüdend. Die ganzen Challenges sind teilweise sehr verbugt und nur schwer spielbar bzw. zu schaffen. Man könnte teilweise in den Monitor schlagen. Die Steuerung mancher Wagen sind teilweise nicht händelbar.

As soon as the player is back in front, the player they just overtaken can drive like a god again until they overtake the player again. And so on and so forth. Very tiring. All of the challenges are sometimes very buggy and difficult to play or complete. You could almost hit the screen at times. The controls for some cars are sometimes unwieldy.

[b]Введение:[/b]
[i]Первоначальное желание протереть монитор, чтобы получить четкую картинку, быстро сменяется желанием стереть игру с жесткого диска, зайдя в игру, благодаря ""замечательному"" звуковому сопровождению сложилось впечатление, что я пошёл играть в какой то хоррор. В игре нет плюсов от слова совсем, не буду долго разглагольствовать, давайте перейдём к сути.[/i]

[b]Графика.[/b] [i]Конечно, я понимаю, что игра далеко не новая, но зачем было добавлять мыло на весь экран, мне не понятно. Текстурки представляют из себя куски пластмассы, так как детализация здесь прям отвратная. эффекты дыма из под колёс и глушителя больше похожи на печку-буржуйку, в моторе сидит бабка и подкидывает дров, дым всегда статично двигается прямолинейно вверх, независимо от того, куда ты поворачиваешь.[/i]

[b]Механика.[/b] [i]Не знаю как и почему, но поставить сюда убогий и криво работающий движок, было очень смелым решением, которое вскоре и провалилось. Сравнивая третью часть со второй, автомобили из податливых и послушных, превратились в утюги, причём независимо от машины, будь то формула либо обычный маслкар, разгоняться и поворачивать они будут одинаково, отличаются они только оболочкой и это прискорбно, а объединяет их то, что управление ими ощущается как игрушечной машинкой на пульте управления...[/i]

[b]Звуковое сопровождение.[/b] [i]От сопровождения, только слово, что касательно фоновой музыки, она отвратна, слушать её желания нет никакого, кроме музыки ""вращайте барабан"" из главного меню и пару закосов под Disturbed треков в игре никаких нет. Со всей остальной звуковой сопровождающей та же история, звуки автомобилей, шин, взрывов, аварий и всего остального, как будто все они были записаны на бабкин диктофон из 90-х, качество отвратительное.[/i]

[b]Интерфейс.[/b] [i]Ничего плохого про него сказать не могу, но и ничего хорошего тоже, обычное игровое меню, кнопки и всё остальное, которое просто требовало чуть больше времени, чтоб выглядеть лучше.[/i]

[b]Дизайн уровней.[/b] [i]Скучный и унылый, других слов тут не подобрать, из разнообразия здесь в основном заборы и бочки, можно было бы добавить к примеру какие то плакаты, рекламные щиты или же другие автомобили тихо стоящие на обочине, но увы, ничего из этого нет, из за чего трассы кажутся достаточно пустыми и мрачными.[/i]

[b]Различные элементы.[/b]
[b]1) Персонажи.[/b] [i]Персонажей придумали достаточно оригинальных, к ним особо вопросов нет, их много и они есть на любой вкус, начиная от побитого бомжа измотанного туалетной бумагой, заканчивая Виктором Петровичем из кухни. Все они одеты красочно и стильно(хоть что то хорошее).[/i]

[b]2) Зомби.[/b] [i]Я когда первый раз услышал, не поверил, что в такой игре такое есть, завезли их очень давно на какой то хэллоуин ивент, с какой целью они нужны в этой игре не понятно. Ничего из себя не представляющее куски мяса, которые просто стоят как истуканы и изредка имеют возможность передвигаться, есть они в одном режиме, где, наверное, карт больше, чем во всей игре в целом, опять же зачем - непонятно.[/i]

[b]3) Машины.[/b] [i]Автомобили здесь имеют: класс, цвет, модель и тюнинг. Класс - это категория машин, то есть, джипы, спортивные либо обычные седаны, цветов тут немного и игра выбирает уже заранее заготовлены, говорит это о том, что покрасить машину самостоятельно вы не сможете, модель отвечает за характеристики машины в целом, их там тоже 4 штуки: Скорость, управляемость, вес и прочность, которые на секунду должны значительно влиять на исход гонки, но такого нет, так как из всех перечисленных мною характеристик, действует лишь прочность. Ну и от тюнинга есть только кнопка, его самого я в игре не нашёл, может быть просто не открыл или не туда жал...[/i]

[b]4) Режимы.[/b] [i]Что я подразумеваю под ""Режимы"" - это трюкач, обычные гонки, Ночной дозор, Монстр-траки, Скорость, Бездорожье и Испытания. Давайте разбирать по порядку

[b]Трюкач[/b] - режим где надо выполнять каскадёрские трюки которые весьма однообразны, попади в мишень либо сломай предметы на ""Н"" сумму очков.

К дефолтным гонкам думаю объяснение не требуется.

[b]Ночной дозор[/b] - Ночная гонка с очень дизбалансным противником, который мало того, что быстро набирает скорость, так ещё и входит в повороты ака гонщик формула-1.

[b]Монстр траки[/b] - режим представляет собой некое сражение команда на команду, каждая из которых состоит из трёх человек, в который входит разгого рода задачи, например, разбить 40 бочек либо взорвать контейнеры.

[b]Скорость[/b] - Такой же режим как и гонки, просто на трассе и машинах из формулы 1

[b]Бездорожье[/b] - Тут не нужно ехать по дорогам, а просто требуется набрать большее количество очков, чем твои соперники, выполняя прыжки, тараня заборы, бочки и прочие текстурки

[b]Испытания[/b] - режим который бросает вызов, типа гонок на время, их там 50 штук, но большинство их них однообразны и скучны.

Также забыл сказать, что в игре ещё есть два вида дерби, различие лишь в количестве участников.
К сожалению, каких то новых или оригинальных я не увидел.[/i]

[b]Итог.[/b] [i]В общем и целом нет и в игре того адреналина, который был в предыдущих частях, уже не хочется вжать педаль газа под шедевральные саундтреки и лететь быстрее к финишу, она могла получиться неплохая, но разработчики решили, не доделывать её, а оставить каждый из вышеперечисленных мной аспектов сделанными наполовину, отчего суммируясь получается Flatout 3, очень жаль, что легендарная серия этой игры прерывает именно на этой части. Почему нельзя было использовать готовую формулу создания предыдущих частей и сделать тоже самое и при этом добавить что то новое - непонятно.
Не рекомендую к прохождению, покупке, просмотру и чему либо ещё, что так или иначе связанно с этой частью, так как есть много других игр, которые могли быть выпущены достаточно давно, но играться свежо они будут даже сейчас.
2 утюга из 10.[/i]","[h1]FlatOut 3: Killing the Series[/h1]
[b]Introduction:[/b]
[i]The initial urge to wipe my monitor clean to get a clearer picture quickly gives way to the urge to erase the game from my hard drive. After entering the game, thanks to the ""wonderful"" soundtrack, I felt like I was playing a horror game. There are absolutely no redeeming features in the game, so I won't waste time on details; let's get to the point.[/i]

[b]Graphics:[/b] [i]Of course, I understand the game is far from new, but I don't understand why they added blurry images to the entire screen. The textures look like pieces of plastic, as the level of detail is simply disgusting. The smoke coming from under the wheels and muffler looks more like a potbelly stove; there's a woman in the engine, throwing wood on it. The smoke always moves statically upward, no matter which way you turn.[/i]

[b]Manual.[/b] [i]I don't know how or why, but installing a wretched and poorly running engine here was a very bold decision, one that soon failed. Comparing the third game to the second, the cars have gone from pliable and obedient to irons. Regardless of the car, be it a Formula 1 or a regular muscle car, they accelerate and turn the same. They differ only in the shell, which is unfortunate. What they have in common is that controlling them feels like driving a toy car with a remote control...[/i]

[b]Soundtrack.[/b] [i]As for the soundtrack, I'll just say one word about the background music: it's disgusting. I have no desire to listen to it. Other than the ""spin the drum"" music from the main menu and a couple of Disturbed-inspired tracks, the game doesn't have anything else. The rest of the soundtrack is the same story: the sounds of cars, tires, explosions, crashes, and everything else, as if they were all recorded on grandma's dictaphone from the 90s. The quality is terrible.[/i]

[b]Interface.[/b] [i]I can't say anything bad about it, but nothing good either. It's a standard game menu, buttons, and everything else that just needed a little more time to look better.[/i]

[b]Level Design.[/b] [i]Boring and dull, there's no other way to describe it. The variety here is mostly fences and barrels. They could have added some posters, billboards, or other cars quietly parked on the side of the road, but alas, none of that is present, making the tracks feel rather empty and gloomy.[/i]

[b]Various Elements.[/b]
[b]1) Characters.[/b] [i]The characters are quite original, there's no real problem with them. There are plenty of them, and they cater to every taste, from a beaten homeless man exhausted by toilet paper to Viktor Petrovich from the kitchen. They're all dressed colorfully and stylishly (at least something good).[/i]

[b]2) Zombies.[/b] [i]When I first heard about them, I didn't believe they existed in a game like this. They were introduced a long time ago for some Halloween event, and it's unclear what purpose they serve in this game. They're just worthless lumps of meat that just stand there like statues, occasionally able to move. They exist in one mode, which probably has more maps than the entire game, but again, why is unclear.[/i]

[b]3) Cars.[/b] [i]Cars here have a class, color, model, and tuning. A class is a category of car, meaning SUVs, sports cars, or regular sedans. Colors are limited, and the game selects pre-sets. This means you can't paint the car yourself. The model determines the car's overall performance, which includes four parameters: Speed, Handling, Weight, and Durability. These should significantly impact the outcome of a race for a second, but they don't, as of all the stats I listed, only Durability matters. The only tuning option is a button; I didn't find it in the game. Maybe I just didn't open it or pressed the wrong button...[/i]

[b]4) Modes.[/b] [i]What I mean by ""Modes"" are Stunt, Normal Races, Night Watch, Monster Trucks, Speed, Off-Road, and Challenges. Let's take it step by step.

[b]Stuntman[/b] - a mode where you have to perform stunts that are quite repetitive: hit a target or break objects worth ""N"" points.

The default races, I think, need no explanation.

[b]Night Watch[/b] - A night race with a very unbalanced opponent who not only picks up speed quickly, but also takes corners like a Formula 1 racer.

[b]Monster Trucks[/b] - a mode that features a team-versus-team battle, each consisting of three people, which includes various objectives, such as breaking 40 barrels or blowing up containers.

[b]Speed[/b] - The same mode as racing, but on a track and with Formula 1 cars.

[b]Off-Road[/b] - You don't have to drive on roads, but simply score more points than your opponents by performing jumps, ramming fences, barrels, and other textures.

[b]Challenges[/b] - A challenging mode, like time trials. There are 50 of them, but most of them are repetitive and boring.

I also forgot to mention that the game also has two types of derbies, the only difference being the number of participants. Unfortunately, I didn't see anything new or original.[/i]

[b]Bottom Line.[/b] [i]Overall, the game lacks the adrenaline rush of the previous installments. You no longer want to press the gas pedal to the masterpiece soundtracks and race to the finish line. It could have been pretty good, but the developers decided not to finish it, leaving each of the aspects I mentioned half-baked. The result, taken together, is Flatout 3. It's a shame that this legendary series ends at this point. Why they couldn't use the established formula for creating the previous installments and do the same thing while adding something new is beyond me.
I don't recommend playing, buying, watching, or doing anything else related to this installment, as there are many other games that might have been released a long time ago, but they'll still feel fresh even now.

Also hab ich die 1,99€ (Sale Januar 2025) ausgegeben und mir das Ziel gesetzt FlatOut 3 durchzuspielen.
Die Rennen machen Spaß, die Technik begeistert und die Audio mag in der Ohrmuschel knallen, aber ist ja auch irgendwie okay. Am meisten hatte ich mit dem SplatOut Mode Spaß gehabt. Die Steuerung der Fahrzeuge ist größtenteils sehr gut geworden, die Strecken sehen ganz gut aus und die Gegner sorgen für explosive Rennen.

Fazit: Den Metascore von 23 hat FlatOut 3 absolut nicht verdient, denn selbst im Vollpreis von 9,99€ bietet FlatOut 3 zwar kein perfektes, aber ein unterhaltsames Gesamtpaket. Gebt dem Spiel ruhig eine Chance.
4,3/5","Well, I have to honestly admit that I was, let's say, ""skeptical"" based on previous reviews.
So I spent the €1.99 (January 2025 sale) and set myself the goal of completing FlatOut 3.
The races are fun, the technology is impressive, and the audio may be jarring in your ear, but that's okay. I had the most fun with the SplatOut mode. The vehicle controls are mostly very good, the tracks look quite good, and the opponents make for explosive races.

Conclusion: FlatOut 3 absolutely doesn't deserve its metascore of 23, because even at the full price of €9.99, FlatOut 3 offers an entertaining overall package, while not perfect. Give the game a chance.

Flatout 2 macht sehr viel Spaß im Karriere Modus wohingegen das Gesamtpaket von Flatout 3 Grafisch und Gameplaymäßig eine totale Enttäuschung ist.

Ganz klar von meiner Seite...
Kauft es euch nicht Spielt lieber 1 & 2 oder greift auf den 4er zu wenn ihr auf Multiplayer aus seid wobei ich nicht weiß ob die Server noch gehen daher informiert euch in dem falle selbst.

Flatout 2 is a lot of fun in career mode, whereas the overall package of Flatout 3 is a total disappointment in terms of graphics and gameplay.

If you then look at Flatout 4, you can look forward to a good game in itself, but it's more like Motorstorm, which I would recommend to Motorstorm fans.

Absolutely from my side...
Don't buy it. Instead, play 1 & 2 or use version 4 if you're looking for multiplayer, although I don't know if the servers are still working, so check it out for yourself in that case.

- Наличие русской локализации.

**Минусы:**
- Отвратительная графика.
- Ужасная физика.
- Безликие, абсолютно одинаковые противники.
- Характеристики машин отличаются только в масштабе классов.
- Нельзя определить, насколько сильно повреждены твоя машина или машины противников.
- Глупейший ИИ.

**Режимы игры:**
1. **Гонка:**
   - Много трасс в шести точках мира, но хватает и очень похожих либо реверсивных трасс.
   - Присутствуют интересные идеи с окружением, которые полностью разбиваются об убогую физику и уродливую графику.

2. **Каскадер:**
   - Ввиду убогости физики, адекватно пройти хоть одно задание в этом режиме не удалось.

3. **Большая битва:**
   - Дерби на 24 машины против тупейшего ИИ.
   - Каким-то образом на всех картах удалось занять первое место, хотя в этом хаосе откровенно ничего не понимал и меня уничтожали в самом начале.

4. **Боевая арена:**
   - Дерби на непродуманных аренах.
   - Большие машины уничтожаются за несколько секунд, а маленькие получают урон по 1-3%.
   - Дебильный ИИ может кататься кругами где-то в дальней части карты либо безуспешно пытаться проехать сквозь стену.
   - На арене с двумя бетонными площадками над водой машины постоянно валятся кучей в воду, урон не получают, респаунятся, но при этом практически не сталкиваются.
   - Можно элементарно застрять в чужой машине без возможности двигаться, а кнопка респауна здесь не работает.
   - В связи с этим сессии затягиваются минут на 10.

5. **Грузовики-монстры:**
   - Несколько однообразных задач по уничтожению объектов на аренах.

6. **Скорость:**
   - Соревнования на больших треках с возможностью разогнаться, хотя скорость в этой игре совсем не ощущается.

7. **Ночная смена:**
   - Гонки на тех же локациях, что и в режиме обычных гонок, но один на один.
   - Соперник дисбалансно быстрый и уезжает далеко вперёд без возможности его догнать.

8. **Бездорожье:**
   - Задачей является добраться из точки А в точку Б, набрав большее количество очков, чем соперники, за дрифт, уничтожение предметов и т.п.
   - Беспонтовая физика всё портит.

9. **Splatoon:**
   - Едешь и сбиваешь статичных зомби, пытаясь сделать как можно более длинную цепочку убийств.
   - Два варианта карт: линейные трассы и арены, не сильно разбавляют скучный процесс уничтожения зомби.

10. **Испытание:**
    - 50 испытаний, ни одно из которых не удалось пройти, потому что в первом необходимо было проехать три круга, заняв первое место, на машине, которая разваливается с трех тычек.

**Итог:**
Flatout 3 оставляет крайне негативное впечатление из-за ужасной графики, отвратительной физики и глупого ИИ. Многообещающие идеи режимов игры полностью разбиваются об эти недостатки, делая игру практически неиграбельной.","**Pros:**
- Russian localization available.

**Cons:**
- Terrible graphics.
- Terrible physics.
- Faceless, identical opponents.
- Car stats differ only by class.
- It's impossible to determine how much damage your car or your opponents have received.
- Stupid AI.

**Game Modes:**
1. **Race:**
- Many tracks across six locations, but plenty of very similar or reversible tracks.
- Some interesting environmental ideas are completely ruined by poor physics and ugly graphics.

2. **Stunt:**
- Due to the poor physics, I couldn't adequately complete a single mission in this mode.

3. **Big Battle:**
- A 24-car demolition derby against incredibly stupid AI. - Somehow, I managed to take first place on all the maps, even though I frankly didn't understand anything in the chaos and was destroyed right from the start.

4. **Battle Arena:**
- Derby matches in poorly designed arenas.
- Large vehicles are destroyed in a few seconds, while smaller ones take 1-3% damage.
- The moronic AI can spin in circles somewhere in the far part of the map or try unsuccessfully to drive through a wall.
- In an arena with two concrete pads over water, cars constantly fall in a heap into the water, take no damage, and respawn, but practically never collide.
- It's easy to get stuck in someone else's car, unable to move, and the respawn button doesn't work.
- Because of this, sessions drag on for about 10 minutes.

5. **Monster Trucks:**
- Several repetitive tasks involving destroying objects in the arenas.

6. **Speed:**
- Races on large tracks with the opportunity to accelerate, although the speed in this game is completely imperceptible.

7. **Night Shift:**
- Races on the same locations as in regular racing mode, but one-on-one.
- The opponent is unbalanced in speed and gets far ahead, with no chance of catching them.

8. **Off-Road:**
- The goal is to get from point A to point B while scoring more points than your opponents by drifting, destroying objects, etc.
- Poor physics ruin everything.

9. **Splatoon:**
- You drive and knock down static zombies, trying to create the longest kill chain possible.
- Two map options: linear tracks and arenas, which don't really add much to the boring zombie-killing experience.

10. **Challenge:**
- 50 challenges, none of which were completed because the first required driving three laps, finishing first, in a car that falls apart after three hits.

**Result:**
Flatout 3 leaves an extremely negative impression due to its terrible graphics, abysmal physics, and stupid AI. The promising game modes are completely ruined by these shortcomings, making the game practically unplayable."

[b] Если коротко, то плохо всё! Эта игра никогда не должна была выходить, это хуже калкорда, хуже всего, во что я, когда-либо играл. [/b]
[h2] Сюжет [/h2]
Закономерно, что его нет, но в предыдущих частях гонки, хотя бы были как-то скомпонованы по группам и кубкам, была какая то упорядоченность, здесь же всё выглядит, как понос первоклашки в школьном туалете, просто рандомно раскиданные, какие-то непонятные активности. Не спасает ни то, что тут есть зомби-режим (копирка со всем нам известной игры), ни гонки на монстр траках, ни бездорожье, никакая активность этого не оправдывает! Позор!
[h2] Графика [/h2]
Это просто вырвиглазно-мыльное отвратительное каловое скопление! По графике в сравнении с алтимейт карнаж даунгрейд лет на 30 назад, такое чувство, что разрабы просто залезли в каждый конфиг и всё там поломали! Отвратительно!
[h2] Движок и физика [/h2]
Здесь всех мужиков должна пробить скупая мужская. Физика отсутствует, как явление. Все машины картонные, физики повреждений нет, все работает так, будто игрушечные машинки сталкивают друг с другом, только при этом, Бог забыл изобрести физику. Ваш автомобиль всегда страдает больше автомобиля оппонента, просто примите это, как факт. Куча багов, застреваний в текстурах, застреваний в автомобилях друг друга! Просто идиотизм.
[h2] Музыка [/h2]
Вы же помните те классные треки из предыдущих частей флэта, которые можно было слушать на репите?) Забудьте напрочь! Здесь нет музыки! Просто какая-то непонятная мелодия играет на фоне. Звуки окружающего мира плоские. Позорище просто.
[h2] Геймплей [/h2]
Как я уже говорил, все гонки ракиданы по каким-то непонятным режимам, никаких кубков нет, меню автомобилей тоже рандомизировано, ничего купить нельзя, зато есть 100500 аватаров (НАВЕРНОЕ РАЗРАБЫ ДУМАЛИ, ЧТО КУЧА БАБ В РОЛИ АВАТАРОВ СПАСУТ ИГРУ), что тоже как-то стремно. От флэтаута в геймплее нет ничего абсолютно. Сюр какой-то.
[h2] DLC [/h2] а вот здесь плюсик) Ну возможно дело в дате выхода игры, тогда выпуск игр частями за оверпрайс каждая не был так популярен. Слава Богу у этих криворуких хватило ума не поддерживать эту агонию сифилитика дополнениями.
[h2] Вердикт [/h2]
3 Флэтаут выглядит, как демка для портфолио криворукого разраба-троешника, но никак не как продолжение легендарной серии. Просто какая-то студия решила примазаться к легендарному имени и разрушила его репутацию. Это очень печально. Я считаю, за такое нужно сажать и лишать права на пожизненно разработки игр.
Моя оценка 0.5 из 10 баллов, к покупке абсолютно не рекомендую, а если купили рекомендую рефанд и письмо с матами в адрес студии. (Если она ещё существует)","What a disgusting piece of code this is!
I regretted just running this garbage on my laptop; now I'll have to wash it with soap.

I'll be honest, when I saw the ""extremely negative"" reviews of this game, I couldn't understand what could possibly be wrong with another Flatout installment. It was a decent game all along. I've never been so wrong.

Well, let's start from the beginning:

[b] In short, it's bad! This game should never have been released. It's worse than Calcord, the worst thing I've ever played. [/b] 
[h2] Plot [/h2] 
It's understandable that there isn't one, but in the previous installments, the races were at least organized by groups and cups, and there was some order. Here, everything looks like a first-grader's diarrhea in a school bathroom, just randomly scattered, incomprehensible activities. It doesn't help that there's a zombie mode (a carbon copy of the game we all know), nor monster truck racing, nor off-roading—no amount of activity justifies it! Shameful!
[h2] Graphics [/h2]
This is simply an eye-watering, soapy, disgusting amalgamation of feces! Compared to Ultimate Carnage, which was downgraded 30 years ago, the graphics feel like the developers simply went into every config and broke everything! Disgusting!
[h2] Engine and Physics [/h2]
Here, all the men must be smashed by stingy men. Physics is completely absent. All the cars are cardboard, there are no damage physics, everything works as if toy cars are being smashed into each other, only God forgot to invent physics. Your car always suffers more than your opponent's, just accept that as a fact. Tons of bugs, people getting stuck in textures, people getting stuck in each other's cars! It's just idiotic.
[h2] Music [/h2]
You remember those cool tracks from the previous Flatout games that you could listen to on repeat? Forget them completely! There's no music here! Just some weird melody playing in the background. The ambient sounds are flat. It's simply disgraceful.
[h2] Gameplay [/h2]
As I already said, all the races are Rakidan in some strange modes, there are no cups, the car menu is also randomized, you can't buy anything, but there are 100,500 avatars (THE DEVELOPERS PROBABLY THOUGHT THAT A BUNCH OF WOMEN AS AVATARS WOULD SAVE THE GAME), which is also kind of creepy. There's absolutely nothing Flatout about the gameplay. It's surreal.
[h2] DLC [/h2] and here's a plus. Well, maybe it's because of the game's release date; releasing games in installments at an overpriced price wasn't so popular back then. Thank goodness these incompetent developers had the sense not to perpetuate this syphilitic agony with DLC.

[h2] Verdict [/h2]
3 Flatout looks like a portfolio demo for a clumsy, mediocre developer, not a continuation of a legendary series. Some studio just decided to latch onto a legendary name and ruin its reputation. It's very sad. I think people should be jailed for this and permanently banned from game development.

My rating is 0.5 out of 10. I absolutely do not recommend purchasing it, and if you bought it, I recommend a refund and a swearing letter to the studio. (If it still exists.)"

Сколько нелестных комментариев было высказано в адрес этой игры, сколько видео-эссе снято, описывающих феномен грандиозного взлёта и не менее грандиозного падения серии игр о сумасшедшем дерби - чего уж там, если долгое время игра была одной из самых низкооценённых пользователями игр в Стиме и по сей день мало кому удалось переплюнуть её статистику (привет, Overwatch 2). Праздничная распродажа и отсутствие игр для прохождения были основной мотивацией проверить, настолько ли страшен чёрт, как его малюют)

Начну с графики - убогий блум и размытие очень сильно портят картинку, а автору эффектов для ночных гонок, где туману завидует Сайлент Хилл, желаю подобную картину наблюдать за рулём своего автомобиля, когда не видно ни пи3ды, кроме тумана и огней вдалеке. По всем остальным моментам, графика во многих моментах хуже второй части. Третий ФлэтАут напоминает чем-то NFS Undercover в аспектах цветовой гаммы, так что независимо от качества приквела - графика слабая, но сносная.

Одной из главных причин негативных отзывов об игре является отсутствие карьеры - вместо этого у нас есть множество разных режимов, только вот Хаос_и_Разрушение берёт количеством, а не качеством.
Гонки на огромных джипах - достаточно разбиться и тебе засчитают победу, ибо противники не делают ничего.
Гонки обычные - ИИ неописуемо тупой и стабильно отстаёт на добрые 3-4 секунды.
Тоже самое в ночных гонках.
Стоит ли начинать разговор о гонках на скоростных треках?
Может быть ИИ набирает больше очков, чем мы, в гонках по бездорожью? Едва ли.
Наверное с противниками сложно соревноваться в гонках на разрушение? Тоже нет.
Зато в эксклюзивном режиме Испытаний наверное хардкор? НЕТ 6ЛЯТЬ.
Дело абсолютно не в том, что в игре мало ""уникального"" контента, а в том, что игра не предоставляет тебе вызова: большинство гонок это просто заезд на время с самим собой, где ты сражаешься только с ублюдской физикой на машинах в случае 99% автомобилей.
Оставшиеся два игровых режима - трюки и зомби-мод не стоят внимания от слова совсем. Первый мне не нравился ещё с прошлых частей, а второй - это причина, по которой у меня столько часов в игре. Монотонная 3алупа короче.

Если в предыдущих частях гонок по бездорожью, физика была аркадной в смысле весёлой и простой, которая вознаграждала тебя за умение притормозить вовремя и красиво пройти поворот, то мало того, что в третьей части большинство машин либо деревянные, либо скользят, как мыло на воде, так ещё и при попытке пройти поворот красиво, тебя на второй космической обгоняет ИИ, чтобы на следующем повороте вписаться в стену и опять отстать на 4-5 секунд. В игре прекрасно управляются Grindr, машины из класса скоростных гонок и призовая xyйня с большими задними колёсами да ускорителем на багажнике. Всё остальное - мусор.

В игре есть куча разных классов автомобилей, но отсутствует самое главное - возможность прокачки. В большинстве случаев, автомобили в своём классе имеют одинаковые статы. Может быть, отличается их внешний вид? Да, это очень интересные нелицензированные машины из реальной жизни, которые поголовно выглядят убого. Это не значит, что если машина не похожа на реальный прототип, то это г0вно - просто именно в третьем ФлэтАуте эти выдуманные средства передвижения это убожество. Да, можно поменять скин, но над окрасками разрабы особо не парились. Да, можно сменить настройки автомобиля, чтобы он ""лучше разгонялся"", но это изменение чисто номинальное и на реальное положение дел никак не влияет.

Третий ФлэтАут в своё время хейтили больше за то, что игра не оправдала ожиданий, нежели за то, что игра была плохой. Была ли игра лет 10 назад плохой? Однозначно. Плохая ли она сейчас? Сейчас она сносная. Сносная она потому, что в последнее время выходит мало достойных игр гоночного жанра - одни и те же Гран Туризмо, Форзы, НФСы без каких-либо нововведений, только с новыми способами развести потребителей на бабки. О крупных корпорациях с их Фар Краями, Колдами и прочими нет даже смысла говорить. На фоне этого всего, я бы прошёл ФлэтАут ещё раз на 100%, нежели сыграл бы в современные однотипные проекты.
Всё-таки, хейтить игру нужно обоснованно - третий ФлэтАут это плохой представитель серии, но за свои деньги по скидке это скорее сносная гонка, сделанная на коленке и на отъе6ись. В истории видеоигр это же памятник упущенным возможностям и показатель того, что важно качество, а не количество.
Советую по скидке приобрести билет в этот музей клоунады, ибо лучше 1 раз увидеть, чем 100 раз услышать об этой игре)",

Flatout 3 — это один из тех примеров, когда ожидания сталкиваются с жестокой реальностью. Я не знаю, кто над этим работал, но результат просто ужасен. Игра выглядит как дешевый клон предыдущих частей, но без хоть какого-то шарма. Графика не просто устарела, а кажется будто ее делали в спешке на быстрое. Анимация автомобилей и физика — это отдельная тема для обсуждения: они кажутся более плоскими и неестественными, чем когда-либо.

Управление автомобилем — это просто кошмар. Автомобили ведут себя как куски металла, а не как настоящие машины. Постоянно падаешь в управление, смена направления — это настоящая пытка. И как будто этого мало, AI противников ведет себя крайне неправдоподобно, а гонки превращаются в какое-то хаотичное месиво.

Кастомизация автомобилей тоже разочаровывает. Мало опций, и те, что есть, не впечатляют. В основном, это только косметические изменения, которые не влияют ни на управление, ни на физику.

Мультиплеер — это просто катастрофа. Постоянные разрывы соединения, лаги и совершенно непонятные механики. Играть с друзьями — это реальное испытание, а не развлечение.

В общем, если вы ищете интересную и динамичную гонку, лучше вообще пропустите Flatout 3. Этот продукт только разочарует. Я очень надеюсь, что кто-то в будущем сможет реабилитировать серию, потому что эта игра — это просто позор.","Flatout 3 is one of those examples where expectations collide with harsh reality. I don't know who worked on it, but the result is simply terrible. The game looks like a cheap clone of the previous games, but without any charm. The graphics are not just outdated, but feel rushed. The car animation and physics are a whole other topic for discussion: they feel flatter and more unnatural than ever.

The driving is a nightmare. The cars behave like hunks of metal, not like real machines. You constantly fall into the controls, and changing direction is pure torture. And as if that weren't enough, the enemy AI behaves extremely implausibly, and racing devolves into a chaotic mess.

Car customization is also disappointing. There are few options, and those that exist are unimpressive. They are mostly cosmetic changes that don't affect either the controls or the physics.

Multiplayer is a complete disaster. Constant connection drops, lag, and completely incomprehensible mechanics. Playing with friends is a real challenge, not fun.

Overall, if you're looking for a fun and dynamic racing game, skip Flatout 3 altogether. This game will only disappoint. I really hope someone can redeem the series in the future, because this game is a disgrace."

Локации такие разнообразные, что вы можете на несколько минут забыть о том, что ваша машина — это не боевая единица, а просто кусок металла, который вы решили использовать не по назначению.

Управление — это отдельная песня! Если вы когда-нибудь мечтали о том, чтобы почувствовать себя в роли курьера, который пытается доставить пиццу на скейтборде, то здесь вы как раз на правильном пути. Ваши гонщики ведут себя так, будто их обучали на курсе «Как быстро перевернуться и приземлиться на крышу». И, конечно, каждая гонка заканчивается так, что вы задаетесь вопросом: «А вообще, кто победил?»

Разрушения в игре — это нечто! Вы сможете отправить свои соперников в такие акробатические трюки, что они позавидуют даже олимпийским гимнастам. А если вы устали от гонок, всегда можно устроить настоящие «средневековые» бои на автомобилях. Никаких правил, только вы, ваши друзья и безумие!

FlatOut 3 — это отличный способ побороть стресс и посмеяться над собственным неумением управлять автомобилем. И помните: если вы не хотите, чтобы ваши гонки закончились на больничной койке, лучше играйте с друзьями по сети! А если ваши друзья выберут против вас, то вам точно пригодится аптечка.

Так что, если у вас есть лишние 20 минут, чтобы потратить их на веселое безумие, FlatOut 3 ждет вас! И не забудьте про попкорн — он вам понадобится, когда будете наблюдать за тем, как ваши машины разлетаются на куски!","If you've been looking for a way to let loose, smash some hardware, and send your opponents to the virtual hospital, then FlatOut 3 is just what you need! This game is like a party with friends, where everyone drinks too much coffee and decides that car racing is nothing more than a way to show off their destruction skills.

The graphics are simply stunning! I don't know how they did it, but even a noisy picture looks like Picasso himself drew it at the bottom of a beer glass. The locations are so varied that for a few minutes you might forget that your car isn't a combat unit, but just a piece of metal you've decided to misuse.

The controls are a whole other story! If you've ever dreamed of feeling like a pizza delivery guy on a skateboard, then you've come to the right place. Your racers act like they've been trained in ""How to Flip and Land on Your Roof."" And, of course, every race ends with you wondering, ""Who won, anyway?""

The destruction in the game is mind-blowing! You'll send your opponents into such acrobatic stunts that they'll make even Olympic gymnasts envious. And if you're tired of racing, you can always engage in real-life ""medieval"" car battles. No rules, just you, your friends, and madness!

FlatOut 3 is a great way to relieve stress and laugh at your own inability to drive. And remember: if you don't want to end your races in the hospital, it's best to play with friends online! And if your friends choose against you, a first aid kit will definitely come in handy.

So, if you have an extra 20 minutes to spend on some fun madness, FlatOut 3 is waiting for you! And don't forget the popcorn—you'll need it when you watch your cars get blown to pieces!"

FlatOut 3: Chaos & Destruction — это, к сожалению, неудачное продолжение серии, предоставляющее игрокам разочаровывающий опыт. Геймплей, управление и физика автомобилей значительно ухудшены по сравнению с предыдущими частями, что делает игру практически неиграбельной. 

Сложно найти положительные аспекты в данной игре: визуальные эффекты и графика выглядят устаревшими, а карта наполнена неинтересными и однообразными трассами. Соперники не отличаются разнообразием, а искусственный интеллект оставляет желать лучшего.

レビュースコアがご覧の状態であることを踏まえ、怖いもの見たさで買うのはアリ。多分、あの伝説のカーゲームよりは幾分マシなゲームです。
本作のゲームモードは10種類あるようですが、この中ではSpeedモードが一番まともな出来とのことなので、2,3回遊んでみました。
操作性が悪すぎると言われますが、ブーストは直線で使い、コーナーを曲がる際は適宜減速することで最低限走ることはできます。
ただし、ダート(路肩)を走っても一切減速せず、ショートカットし放題であるなど、レースゲームとしては崩壊しています。

他のモードはまず褒められる出来ではないでしょう。全部遊んだわけではありませんが、このレビュースコアなのだからそうなのでしょう。

Given the review score, I'm willing to buy it out of curiosity. It's probably a little better than that legendary car game. 
This game apparently has 10 game modes, but I heard that Speed ​​mode is the most decent, so I played it a couple of times. 
Some say the controls are too difficult, but you can still drive at a reasonable level by using boost in straight lines and slowing down appropriately when turning corners. 
However, the game doesn't slow down at all even when driving on dirt roads (shoulders), allowing for unlimited shortcuts, making it a complete failure as a racing game. 

The other modes are hardly worth praising. I haven't played all of them, but with this review score, that's probably why. 
One positive is that it supports high resolution for a game of this era (2011) and has no FPS cap. 
However, if you're just looking for fun, you're better off buying a modern game."

1. Неработающие уровни. Хотелось бы видеть хотя бы работающие уровни (возможсность открыть offroad уровни), но даже и того не завезли. Хотя если взять старое сохранение, то с ним можно будет сыграть.

2. Карьера. Ее нет. А хотелось бы - ведь продолжение первых двух частей где она была.

3. Разнообразие уровней. По этому критерию можно поставить твердый плюс, если бы не некоторые особенности.
- Классические гонки (день + ночь) достаточно прикольные но ровно до того момента когда ты понимаешь что траектория машин заскриптовано. Это значит что на опасных поворотах боты будут вести себя лучше чем ты. Особенно начинает прям бесить когда на ночной трассе ты не вписываешься в поворот просто потому что, а бот тебя обставляет как нефиг делать.
- Ралли. Две гонки не разблокируется и вместо обычных гонок ты получаешь как бы некий аналог Pure где тебе надо делать трюки. Прикольно но... категория дрифт? На багги?.. Зато хоть в разрушении можно много баллов получить
- Болиды. Вопросов нет.
- Трюки. Достаточно легкие но интересные. Вопросов нет. Чем-то даже лучше первых частей (и уж точно лучше 4 части).
- Зомби. Плюс что этот режим есть и зомби подвижны. Но складывается ощущение что разрушаешь коробки, потому что их скорость почти равна нулю да и спавнятся они могут на воздухе.
- Испытания. Порой прикольные, пара достаточно сложных, одно (ночное) почти нереальное. Спасибо. Заставляет поднапрячь булки.
- Монстр-траки. Вот тут возникает много вопросов. Тебя бьют не соперники, а союзники. Соперники да и союзники могут порой крутиться на одном месте. Цель выполняешь ты один. Ты по умолчанию победитель даже если ты проиграл. Ты можешь уничтожиться не доехав до цели банально. В общем очень и очень спорно.
- Дерби и большое дерби. Тут самые большие вопросы. В связи с тем, что физику изменили, теперь ты получаешь урон не только за силу но еще и за время столкновений, а от того какой частью машины ты столкнулся, ничего не зависит. Плюс когда газуешь в соперника, ты можешь получить больше урона чем он. Очень жалко, что не получилось как в 1-2 частях. Очень жалко.

4. Локализация
Она присутствует, но порой забавна. Порпалла GT. Что это? Звучит забавно. Ладно там Детроид хоть перевели адекватно.

5. Саундтреки.
Тут строгий минус. По умолчанию музыка выключена, и не зря. Звуки тачки отвратительны. Треки также, без слов, слушать больше 1 раза не хочется. Если выключить ее совсем и включить свою, будет гораздо лучше. Ехать под классические треки CrashDay, NFS MW, Flatout 1, 2, напевая под нос ""Hey-yey-yey-yea"" из классических частей гораздо приятнее.

6. Графика.
Если бы я увидел ее в 2013, я бы ужаснулся. Но в 2024 это почти ностальгик. Плюс присутствует режим 4k. Спасибо, оно становится не вырвиглазным. Правда из-за этого не работает вертикальная синхронизация и игра вылетает но да ладно...

7. Управление.
Достаточно классическое, немного топорное, аркадное. Иногда не вписываешься в поворот. Основной вопрос только к ботам которые едут по скрипту и порой из-за этого быстрее тебя. На развилках выбирают всегда одно и то же направление.

8. FPS.
Еще один плюс - играть в игру с 400 FPS в 2к24. Оптимизация.

9. Мультиплеер
Можно найти комнату. Для ачивки достаточно. Далее игра вылетает пулей у хоста.

10. Ачивки.
Можно получить все (если разблокировать оффроад уровни и реверс треки), особо проблем нет.

Выводы.
Все еще не рекомендую. Игра периодически крашится в рандомные моменты времени. Плюс она меняет графику в винде, может шрифт мелкий сделать к примеру. Но все равно от нее можно получить удовольствие, у меня вызвала даже ностальгические чувства.","Let's do a review after a full playthrough.

1. Broken levels. I'd like to see at least working levels (the ability to unlock offroad levels), but they didn't even add that. Although if you use an old save, you can play it.

2. Career. It's missing. I'd like it, after all, this is a continuation of the first two games, which had one.

3. Level variety. This would be a solid plus, if not for a few quirks.
- Classic races (day and night) are pretty cool, but only until you realize the cars' trajectories are scripted. This means that bots will perform better on dangerous turns than you. It's especially annoying when you miss a turn on a night track simply because the bot beats you to it.
- Rally. Two races can't be unlocked, and instead of regular races, you get something like a Pure version where you have to perform stunts. Cool, but... the drift category? Buggy?.. But at least you can get a lot of points in destruction.
- Cars. No questions asked.
- Stunts. Quite easy but interesting. No questions asked. Somehow even better than the first games (and definitely better than Part 4).
- Zombies. It's a plus that this mode exists and the zombies are mobile. But it feels like you're destroying boxes because their speed is practically zero and they can spawn in the air.
- Challenges. Sometimes they're fun, a couple are quite challenging, and one (at night) is almost impossible. Thank you. It makes you work hard.
- Monster trucks. This raises a lot of questions. It's not your opponents who hit you, but your allies. Opponents and allies alike can sometimes spin in one place. You're the only one completing the objective. You're the default winner even if you lose. You can be destroyed before reaching the objective, which is trivial. Overall, it's very, very debatable.
- Derby and Grand Derby. This is where the biggest questions arise. Because the physics have changed, you now take damage not only for force but also for the duration of collisions, and the part of the car you hit has no bearing on it. Plus, when you accelerate into an opponent, you can take more damage than they do. It's a real shame it didn't turn out like in parts 1 and 2. A real shame.

4. Localization
It's there, but sometimes it's funny. Porpalla GT. What is that? It sounds funny. At least Detroit was translated adequately.

5. Soundtracks.
This is a major downside. The music is turned off by default, and for good reason. The car sounds are awful. The tracks, too, without lyrics, are uninspiring to listen to more than once. If you turn it off completely and turn on your own, it will be much better. Driving to classic tracks from CrashDay, NFS MW, and Flatout 1 and 2, humming ""Hey-yey-yey-yea"" from the classic games, is much more enjoyable.

6. Graphics.
If I'd seen it in 2013, I would have been horrified. But in 2024, it's almost nostalgic. Plus, there's a 4K mode. Thankfully, it's not so eye-popping. True, it prevents vertical sync from working and the game crashes, but oh well...

7. Controls.
Quite classic, a bit rough, arcade-like. Sometimes you miss a turn. The main issue is with the bots, who follow a script and are sometimes faster than you because of it. At forks in the road, they always choose the same direction.

8. FPS.
Another plus is playing the game at 400 FPS in 2k24. Optimization.

9. Multiplayer
You can find a room. Enough for an achievement. Then the game crashes for the host.

10. Achievements.
You can get everything (if you unlock off-road levels and reverse tracks), no big deal.

Conclusions.
I still wouldn't recommend it. The game crashes occasionally at random times. Plus, it changes the graphics in Windows, maybe making the font small, for example. But you can still enjoy it; it even gave me a nostalgic feeling."

И мне его жаль, потому что я тоже играл в эту игру.

Тут от FlatOut одно название. Такого трешака я ещё не видел.
Я думал серия NFS скатилась со временем, но даже там такого мусора не производили в то время.

В этой игре ужасно всё: управление, музыка, физика, графика (2011 год если что, а текстуры картонные, как и погодные условия от которых у меня болели глаза (дождь смотрелся как обстрел лазерными лучами из с космического корабля, и уж точно не каплями воды, а бомбами!)). В трассах вроде пытались сделать разнообразие, но всё перекрывают предыдущие недостатки.

Я постоянно думал, что играю в мобильную игру на Unity, но нет, это компьютерная игра 2011 года выпуска, а сделанная будто в 2000. Как будто её делали параллельно оригинальному FlatOut, а выпустить решили через 7 лет после релиза первой части.

This is nothing like FlatOut in name alone. I've never seen such trash.
I thought the NFS series had gone downhill, but even they didn't produce such garbage back then.

Everything about this game is terrible: the controls, the music, the physics, the graphics (it was 2011, by the way, and the textures are cardboard, as are the weather conditions, which hurt my eyes (the rain looked like laser beams from a spaceship, and definitely not drops of water, but bombs!)). They seemed to try to add variety to the tracks, but everything else outweighs the previous shortcomings.

I kept thinking I was playing a Unity mobile game, but no, it's a computer game from 2011, but it feels like it was made in 2000. It's like it was made concurrently with the original FlatOut, and they decided to release it seven years after the first game.

The third installment features even more interesting game modes, such as: Race, hit the target outside the camera's view, Battle Royale, another Battle Royale, another Battle Royale, find the tiny pixel on a giant map, a Formula 1 simulator, and even a rival to the great Left4dead.
Many call the physics in this game broken, but I'd call it hardcore, the envy of any racing sim.

173627772,russian,2024.07.28 18:01,❌,✅,0.5445657969,3,"Думаю, любой, кто пробовал третью часть, надеялся, что игра сможет ему или ей понравиться если не как продолжение знаменитой франшизы, то хотя бы как автогонка как таковая. Я вот тоже так думал, т.е. что возможно игрокам не понравилось изменение концепции, которую они восприняли как предательство и что сама по себе третья часть неплохая в качестве просто другого автосимулятора. Но как оказалась, игра плоха не потому, что это совершенно другая игра, т.е. что Flatout 3 не имеет никакого отношения к FlatOut как к серии, а что игра плоха просто потому, что плоха. Перед нами просто плохо сделанный автосимулятор без учёта названии игры.

Вначале я долго привыкал к управлению и необходимости тормозить ручником, но вскоре я стал проходить довольно легко трассу за трассой. Проблема была в том, что я это делал как бы автоматически, без удовольствия. Такое у меня бывает крайне редко. Даже бесплатные университетские проекты (не все, конечно) вызывали у меня интерес, а тут я играл без какого-либо энтузиазма, как будто вымучивал игру. Да, игру можно пройти без особых проблем, вот только... не интересно. И не интересно потому что... тут вообще нет ничего интересного, ни одного интересного элемента.

Автомобили. Как правильно кто-то заметил, это скорее игрушечные машинки, нежели настоящие, которые были даже в первой FlatOut. Далее, нет никакой разрушаемости автомобилей, как нет и разрушаемости окружения или, если быть точнее, ощущения от разрушаемого окружения. Была создана имитация разрушаемых объектов, но это выглядит как разрушаемость из компьютерных игр 2000 года, когда взрываются строго определённые и крайне ограниченные объекты как, например, бочки или припаркованные автомобили. Поэтому верно было бы заявить, что в третьей части нет разрушения. Да и как иначе, если у нас тут игрушечные автомобили, которые предлагают минимальное, едва видимое повреждение. Как мне кажется, повреждение автомобилей прямо пропорционально разрушающимся объектам на самой трассе, т.е. тех объектов, которые располагаются на трассе и с которыми можно взаимодействовать посредству прямого контакта (разлетающиеся коробки, пластиковые столы со стульями, и пр.).

Локации или качество спроектированных трасс. Они гармонично вписываются в общую концепцию игры, но при этом как трассы, они ужасно спроектированы (зачастую прямые линия с резкими поворотами на 90 градусов). Но даже это для меня не было самым главным недостатком трасс. Главный минус, это ужасное информирование игрока куда сворачивать. Я постоянно сворачивал (или наоборот не сворачивал) не туда куда нужно. Мы все помним, что одной из главных фишек второй FlatOut было наличие множества альтернативных путей, но тут такой опции как будто нет либо она запрятана настолько глубоко в этих намалёванных хаотичного вида трассах, что нужно специально одну гонку посвящать исследованию локации, чтобы отыскать скрытый альтернативный путь (я лишь однажды нашёл такой путь и то, назвать его ""удачной альтернативой"" у меня язык не повернётся). И это я молчу про то, что компьютер никогда этим путём не пользовался. Сюда же можно добавить отвратительно реализованные активные объекты окружающей обстановки, как например боевой вертолёт, который постоянно обстреливает одну из зон на трассе или движущиеся поезда, между которыми нам нужно проехать. Задумка может быть и интересная, но так как сама игра ужасная, то и эта задумка не особо помогает изначально плохой игре выбраться хотя бы на средние позиции. Как машинки у нас игрушечные, так и вертолёт такой же игрушечный. Безумие ландшафта, благодаря которому мы чувствуем себя как на американских горках, добавляет аркадности, но в ущерб реализму (тому самому благодаря которому мы и имеем так полюбившуюся многим разрушаемость объектов).

На фоне этого, графика, тюнинг (которого, считай, тут и нет), звук, управление автомобилем, соперники и всё остальное меркнут, впрочем, и эти элементы выглядят отвратительно. Как я написал в самом начале, каждый элемент игры реализован ужасно. Я не думаю, что проблема именно в стилистике гоночных машинок, но в том, как всё это было реализовано. Да, Flatout 3 кардинально отличается от всех остальных частей и в этом смысле третья часть FlatOut предлагает что-то новое, вот только это ""что-то"" стало буквально всем, ибо от классической FlatOut тут не осталось ровным счётом ничего. Но даже всё это новое тут реализовано спустя рукава. Крайне отрицательная оценка (16%) – вполне заслуженная оценка.","I think anyone who tried the third game hoped they'd enjoy it, if not as a continuation of the famous franchise, then at least as a racing game in its own right. I thought the same thing, that perhaps players didn't like the change in concept, which they perceived as a betrayal, and that the third game itself was fine as simply a different racing simulator. But as it turns out, the game isn't bad because it's a completely different game—that is, Flatout 3 has nothing to do with the FlatOut series—it's bad simply because it's bad. It's simply a poorly made racing simulator, regardless of its title.

At first, it took me a while to get used to the controls and the need to use the handbrake, but soon I was able to complete track after track quite easily. The problem was, I was doing it almost automatically, without any real pleasure. That rarely happens to me. Even free university projects (not all of them, of course) piqued my interest, but here I played without any enthusiasm, as if I was forcing myself through the game. Yes, the game is easy to complete, but... it's just not engaging. And it's not engaging because... there's nothing interesting here, not a single interesting element.

Cars. As someone rightly pointed out, these are more like toy cars than the real thing, which even the first FlatOut had. Furthermore, there's no destructibility of the cars, nor is there any destructibility of the environment, or, more accurately, the feeling of a destructible environment. A simulation of destructible objects was created, but it looks like the destructibility from computer games from 2000, where strictly defined and extremely limited objects explode, like barrels or parked cars. Therefore, it would be fair to say that there's no destruction in the third game. And how could it be otherwise, when we have toy cars here that offer minimal, barely visible damage. It seems to me that the damage to the cars is directly proportional to the destructibility of objects on the track itself, i.e. Objects located on the track that can be interacted with through direct contact (scattered boxes, plastic tables and chairs, etc.).

The locations or quality of the designed tracks. They fit harmoniously into the overall concept of the game, but as tracks, they are terribly designed (often straight lines with sharp 90-degree turns). But even this wasn't the tracks' biggest flaw for me. The main drawback is the terrible information about where to turn. I was constantly turning (or not turning) in the wrong places. We all remember that one of the main features of the second FlatOut was the numerous alternative routes, but here this option seems to be absent, or hidden so deeply in these chaotic, painted tracks that you need to dedicate a single race to exploring the location to find the hidden alternative route (I only found such a route once, and even then, I can't bring myself to call it a ""good alternative""). And that's not to mention the fact that the computer never used this approach. Add to this the horribly implemented active environmental objects, like the attack helicopter that constantly fires at one of the track zones, or the moving trains we have to navigate between. The concept may be interesting, but since the game itself is terrible, it doesn't really help an initially bad game even reach the average level. Just as the cars are toy-like, so is the helicopter. The insanity of the landscape, which makes us feel like we're on a roller coaster, adds an arcade feel, but at the expense of realism (the very same realism that gives us the destructibility so beloved by many).

Compared to this, the graphics, tuning (which is practically nonexistent), sound, car control, opponents, and everything else pale in comparison, and even these elements look terrible. As I wrote at the very beginning, every element of the game is terribly implemented. I don't think the problem lies specifically in the racing car style, but in the way it was implemented. Yes, Flatout 3 is radically different from all the other installments, and in that sense, the third FlatOut offers something new, but that ""something"" is literally everything, as absolutely nothing remains of the classic FlatOut. But even this new implementation is half-hearted. The extremely negative rating (16%) is well-deserved."

Los controles mal, los coches se sienten que flotan y siguen girando a la vez que pesados y lentos en los giros.

Las acrobacias son un chiste también, al lanzar al personaje tiene la misma probabilidad de salir disparado para delante que hacia los lados.....

En fin, es un juego sin gracia, sin alma y aburrido (excepto por la IA que a veces con el ""rubber banding"" alcanza velocidades supersonicas y los piñazos son legendarios).

The stunts are a joke too; when you throw your character, they have the same chance of being launched forward as sideways...

А делать в нем надо следующее - Затолкнуть в контейнер любую рядом стоящую бочку. К слову, не совсем понимаю почему в этом режиме есть возможность выбрать машину любого другого класса, а не только монстр-траки. Кстати, вы можете тупо скипнуть все уровни с монстр-траками - просто разбейтесь, и вам все равно будет засчитано прохождение(почему такая возможность есть - не понятно. возможно игру тупо не тестировали)
Бездорожье: Просто есть и работает.
Ночная смена: Гонки по трассам из режима ""Гонки"", только в ночное время суток, дождем, около нулевой видимостью дороги и плохим сцеплением. Какие-то трассы играются нормально, какие-то хуже из-за большого количества эффектов тумана и дождя на экране.
Скорость: Почему в нем можно выбрать машину любого другого класса а не только гоночные болиды - не понятно. Сказать про него нечего, а про болиды я высказался выше.
Испытания: Некоторые из них будут тем еще развлечением для заднего прохода. Держите кстати бесплатные советы по прохождению некоторых: Развернуться и поехать в обратную сторону перед трамплином в испытании 19, который даже со скоростью игры ""Быстро"" практически нереально перепрыгнуть; Поменять скорость игры на ""Быстро"" для испытаний с трюками(зачем кстати нам вообще дают возможность баловаться со скоростью игры?); Поменять некоторые значения в файлах игры чтобы ваши оппоненты разбились на первом повороте, потому что честно их победить впринципе нереально, в испытании 30(Смотрите обсуждения, там есть вопрос посвященный этому испытанию, в ответах есть инструкция что и в каких файлах менять).
Дерби: Худшее дерби в которое вы можете сыграть.
Гонки: Ну кстати трассы в этой игре неплохие
Музыка: При входе в игру вас встречает музыка из ада(а вот из ада, или из ЗАДа - вопрос хороший). По большей части говно, но есть пара слушабельных треков и даже один алмаз - ""Bring it Down"" от Redshirt Theory(поглядите кстати клип к ней, улыбнетесь) и вторая его вариация.

Заключение/итог: Как Flatout - игра плохая. Возможно, если бы она называлась по другому, она не словила бы столько говна в свой адрес. Можно ли в это играть? - Ну-у....может быть. Если купить по скидке за 38р, отключить мозги и представить что она называется по-другому, вы сможете получать некоторое....ммм....извращенное, специфическое удовольствие играя в нее. Во всяком случае это лучше чем гача-игры на мобилках что выдрачивают твой кошелек до суха, здесь хотя бы есть геймплей (Пожалуй это самый большой комплимент что я могу отвесить этой игре)","For some reason, I bought this, achieved all the achievements except for the multiplayer, and I have something to say. I'll go over every aspect of the game.
Physics: It feels like it was made with Unity Web Player or Adobe Flash. Collisions with opponents are completely unenjoyable because they're implemented incredibly poorly – you hit someone at full speed and lose a surprising 1% of their durability, a little more, or even 0%, while simply touching a wall or the slightest impact can cause you to lose a full 10% or more.
Nitro in this game isn't so much a boost as it is a car repair tool. Yes, you heard right, nitro in this game repairs your car. This is a feature mentioned on the loading screens, though the very ""high-quality"" translation makes it a bit difficult to understand.
Car fleet: It's not small, it's quite varied, and that's a fact. I'm still trying to figure out why F1 cars handle like crap. There are many modes, and most of them are varied, and that's a fact. I'll go into detail:
Stunts: They're still there. However, some of them are frustrating to play due to the awkward camera tracking the driver. Additionally, you can't influence the driver's flight path forever, because once the ""Aftertouch"" bar runs out, your opinion is no longer taken into account by the game, and the driver flies where he was originally going.
By the way, male drivers moan with the sound of a woman. I don't know if this is a bug or a feature; after all, we live in progressive times.
Splatout: Crush zombies that don't even move. It fits this game perfectly if you consider it a standalone game, but it doesn't fit the Flatout series.
Monster Trucks: Playable. However, due to the very ""high-quality"" translation, it's a bit difficult to understand what to do in the ""Let There Be Light"" level. Here's what you need to do: Push any nearby barrel into a container. By the way, I don't quite understand why you can select any other class of vehicle in this mode, not just monster trucks. Incidentally, you can simply skip all the monster truck levels—just crash, and you'll still be credited for completing them (why this is possible is unclear; perhaps the game hasn't been tested).
Off-Road: It's just there and it works.
Night Shift: Races on tracks from the ""Race"" mode, only at night, in the rain, with near-zero visibility and poor traction. Some tracks play fine, while others are worse due to the large number of fog and rain effects on the screen.
Speed: Why you can select any other class of vehicle in this mode, not just racing cars, is unclear. There's nothing to say about that, and I've already commented on the racing cars.
Challenges: Some of them will be quite a challenge. By the way, here are some free tips for completing some of them: Turn around and drive backwards before the ramp in Challenge 19, which is practically impossible to jump over even at ""Fast"" game speed; Change the game speed to ""Fast"" for the stunt challenges (why do they even let us mess around with the game speed?); Change some values ​​in the game files so your opponents crash on the first turn, because beating them fairly is basically impossible, in Challenge 30 (see the discussions, there's a question about this challenge, the answers include instructions on what and in which files to change).
Derby: The worst derby you can play.
Racing: By the way, the tracks in this game are pretty good.
Music: When you enter the game, you're greeted by music from hell (or from hell, or from ZAD – that's a good question). It's mostly crap, but there are a couple of listenable tracks and even one gem – ""Bring it Down"" by Redshirt Theory (by the way, check out the music video for it, you'll smile) and its second version.

Conclusion: Like Flatout, it's a bad game. Perhaps if it had a different name, it wouldn't have gotten so much flak. Is it playable? - Well...maybe. If you buy it on sale for 38 rubles, turn off your brain, and imagine it's called something else, you might get some...umm...perverse, peculiar pleasure playing it. At least it's better than those gacha games on mobile that drain your wallet dry; at least there's gameplay here (perhaps that's the biggest compliment I can give this game)."

Если серьёзно, то это одна из худших игр в которые я когда-либо играл. Я предварительно знал что этот игросодержащий продукт не особо тепло ценится в народе, но тем не менее всё равно решил в это поиграть. Поиграл. Не просто поиграл, а прошёл на 100%. Рот до сих пор в каловых массах, вкуснятина. Даже в 2024 году, глядя сквозь призму всего того дерьма что вышло после FlatOut 3, это трэш. Это трэш среди трэша.

[b]Первое[/b] что бросается в глаза - графика. Графика просто ч у д о в и щ н а я, хуже чем в первой, лять, части. И это не шутка, не утрирование, не преувеличение, здесь действительно графика хуже чем в первой части, можете сами сравнить скриншоты единицы и трёшки, там где лютое мыло и отвратительного качества текстуры - это трёшка.

[b]Второе[/b] что бросается уже не в глаза - отсутствие музыки. За пределами главного меню её нет. В аркадной гонке с предполагаемым безудержным весельем и уничтожением всего что уничтожается нет музыки. Серьёзно? 
Ладно, уже после полного прохождения игры читанул обзоры, где-то глаз зацепился за факт, что оказывается в игре музыка есть, просто по умолчанию она отключена. Полез в настройки, оказалось правда, в настройках звука напротив музыки нужно поменять ""Игровая музыка"" на ""Своя музыка"" или что-то в этом роде. Запустил проверить первую гонку, да, музыка появилась. Лучше бы она, лять, не появлялась, кровь из ушей до сих пор хлещет. Музыка каким-то странным образом поломала игровые звуки, всё стало кряхтеть и пердеть. Сама же ""музыка"" кал.   

[b]Третий[/b] кирпичик этой коричневой конструкции - ощущение езды и физика. Здесь нет гоночных автомобилей, здесь вообще нет АВТОМОБИЛЕЙ, здесь вы управляете игрушечными машинками, с которыми все мальчуганы играли в детстве. Хотя даже у ИГРУШЕЧНЫХ машинок физика лучше, чем от здешних картонок. Управлять ими крайне затруднительно и неприятно, поворачивать это боль моя дырка задница, постоянно во что-то влетаешь.

[b]Четвёртый[/b] круг здешнего ада - планировка трасс. Трассы отвратительно настроены, тестеров по всей видимости у конторки разработавшей этот шедевр не было, а сами играть в своё детище разработчики брезгали. Постоянные прямые повороты на 90 градусов, местами хрен пойми куда ехать, на больших скоростях смотришь не на миникарту, а на дорогу, на которой порой тупо нет ориентиров, а если и есть, то они попросту сливаются с окружением. Особенно ярко мне запомнилось испытание на автобусах. Если кратко, на определённом участке трассы есть подъём в горку, который заканчивается трамплином. Только вот незадача, автобус тяжёлый, чтобы заехать на горку, а уж тем более перепрыгнуть через трамплин нужна скорость, которой у этого автобуса нет. Нитро тоже нет. Разогнаться особо негде, прямой кусочек трассы перед трамплином не даёт нужной скорости, а перед этим кусочком прямой поворот. Бился я с этим минут 10-15, пока мне в голову не пришла идея. Единственный соперник аналогично тупил перед этим трамплином и ничего не мог сделать, поэтому я спокойно в него впечатался, нитро появилось. Отъехал на пол карты назад, взял хороший разгон, пару раз пытался вписаться в мой любимый поворот в 90 градусов и наконец с помощью нитро и божьей помощи таки вписался и перепрыгнул. Кто. Блять. Это. Тестировал. Ой, я ведь уже ответил на этот вопрос, никто. Противник кстати так и тупил в этот трамплин пока я наяривал все три круга.

[b]Пятая[/b] деталь этого мусорного титана - всякие мелкие недочёты, вроде проваливаний под текстуры, забагованных ИИ-соперниках, которые могут постоянно возрождаться в какой-то угол и практически полностью упразднённый тюнинг. Номинально тюнинг здесь есть, фактически нет. ""Тютинг"" здесь представлен двумя-тремя бесплатными опциями, которые доступны с самого начала. Первая опция - автомобиль по умолчанию. Здесь всё понятно. Вторая опция - утяжелённый и более прочный, но в то же время более медленный вариант. Третья опция - противоположность второй, более хрупкий и в то же время более быстрый автомобиль. Никакой валюты как в предыдущих частях, как и деталей, которые покупались бы за эту валюту здесь нет. Правильно, а зачем запариваться над системой тюнинга, когда можно не запариваться. 

А теперь самое смешное - после полного прохождения я нашёл у этого днища положительные элементы! Э, какая психушка? Вы угораете что-ли, какая психушка?! Вы чё угораете?!! Какая психушка?!!! Это вы кого вызвали?! Так вот, положительные стороны. Здесь неплохой ассортимент тачек, даже танк есть! Появилась возможность выбирать водителя, водителей хватает, есть пара забавно-мемных вроде местного Вин Дизеля. Правда эти водители НИ НА ЧТО не влияют, хотя придумать что-то можно было бы. Режимов прилично, как старых добрых гонок, дерби и всяко разных трюков с водителем, так и новых, которые на бумаге звучат вполне неплохо. Примитивненькие квестики на монстртраках (сбей 40 бочек, допихай мину до канализации и прочее), гонки на скоростных тачках, сносный зомби режимчик, ночные гонки. Местами прикольное визуальное оформление трасс, некоторые занятные геймплейные элементы вроде вертолётов обстреливающих определённые участки трассы или, скажем, движущиеся поезда, мимо которых нужно протиснуться. Звучит же прикольно! Были же интересные идеи! Жаль только что стоЯт эти идеи не на крепком фундаменте второй части, а в луже из мочи и дерьма.  

Почему я ничего не сказал про мультиплеер? Думаю, этот вопрос в ответе не нуждается, здесь и так всё понятно.

Итого: людям которые ценят своё время и психическое здоровье - не рекомендую играть ни при каких обстоятельствах. Любителям трэша и помойных вкусностей вроде меня... Ну, Бог нам судья","Well, I don't know, it's a great game for me! Before joining the army, I decided to play this third FlatOut of yours, just to see what it was like. After completing it, the military recruitment office declared me insane and didn't draft me. Now I'm in a mental hospital, relaxing :)

Seriously, this is one of the worst games I've ever played. I knew beforehand that this gaming product wasn't particularly well-received, but I decided to play it anyway. I played it. Not just played it, I completed it 100%. My mouth is still soaked with feces, it was delicious. Even in 2024, looking through the prism of all the crap that came out after FlatOut 3, it's trash. It's trash among trash.

The first thing that catches your eye is the graphics. The graphics are simply atrocious, worse than the first fucking game. And this isn't a joke, it's not an exaggeration, it's not an overstatement. The graphics here are truly worse than in the first game. You can compare the screenshots of the first and third games for yourself. Where there's pure clutter and terrible texture quality, it's the third game.

The second thing that's noticeable is the lack of music. There's none outside the main menu. An arcade racing game supposedly full of unbridled fun and destruction of everything that can be destroyed has no music. Seriously?

Okay, after I finished the game, I read the reviews and noticed that it turns out there is music in the game, it's just turned off by default. I went into the settings, and it turns out that in the sound settings, next to the music, you need to change ""Game Music"" to ""Custom Music"" or something like that. I launched the first race to test it, and yes, the music appeared. I wish it hadn't appeared, my ears are still bleeding. The music somehow broke the game sounds; everything started groaning and farting. The ""music"" itself is crap.

The third brick of this brown construction is the driving experience and physics. There are no race cars here, no CARS at all; here you're driving toy cars, the kind every little boy played with as a kid. Although even TOY cars have better physics than the cardboard ones here. Controlling them is extremely difficult and unpleasant; turning is a pain in the ass, constantly crashing into things.

The fourth circle of hell here is the track layout. The tracks are terribly configured; apparently the studio that developed this masterpiece had no testers, and the developers themselves were too disgusted to play their brainchild. Constant 90-degree turns, sometimes it's hard to tell where you're going. At high speeds, you're looking not at the minimap, but at the road, which sometimes simply lacks landmarks, or if there are, they simply blend in with the surroundings. I especially remember the bus test vividly. Briefly, there's a certain section of the track that climbs up a hill and ends with a ramp. The only problem is, the bus is heavy, so driving up the hill, let alone over the ramp, requires speed, which this bus doesn't have. There's no nitro either. There's no room to pick up speed; the straight section of track before the ramp doesn't allow for the necessary speed, and before that section, there's a straight turn. I struggled with this for 10-15 minutes until I came up with an idea. My only opponent was similarly stumped before this ramp and couldn't do anything, so I calmly crashed into him, and the nitro came back. I drove halfway back on the map, gained some speed, tried to negotiate my favorite 90-degree turn a couple of times, and finally, with the help of nitro and God's help, I managed to get it in and jump over. Who. Fuck. This. Tested. Oh, I already answered that question: nobody. By the way, the opponent kept stumbling on that ramp while I was grinding out all three laps.

The fifth detail of this garbage titan is all sorts of minor flaws, like falling through textures, buggy AI opponents that can constantly respawn in a certain corner, and the almost completely abolished tuning. Tuning is nominally present here, but in reality, it's not. ""Tuning"" is represented by two or three free options that are available from the start. The first option is the default car. Everything is self-explanatory. The second option is a heavier and more durable, but also slower, option. The third option is the opposite of the second, a more fragile yet faster car. There's no currency like in the previous games, nor are there any parts that can be purchased with that currency. Right, why bother with a tuning system when you can skip it?

And now the funniest part: after completing the entire game, I found some positive aspects to this underbelly! Hey, what kind of mental hospital? What kind of mental hospital?! What kind of mental hospital?! What kind of mental hospital?! Who are you calling?! So, here are the positive aspects. There's a decent selection of cars, even a tank! You can now choose your driver, and there are plenty of them, including a couple of funny, meme-worthy ones like the local Vin Diesel. However, these drivers don't affect ANYTHING, although something could have been invented. There are a decent number of modes, from good old races, demolition derbies, and various driver tricks, to new ones that sound pretty good on paper. Simple monster truck quests (shoot down 40 barrels, push a mine to the sewer, etc.), high-speed car racing, a decent zombie mode, and night racing. The track visuals are occasionally cool, and there are some interesting gameplay elements, like helicopters firing at certain sections of the track or, say, moving trains you have to squeeze past. Sounds cool! There were some interesting ideas! It's just a shame these ideas aren't built on the solid foundation of the second game, but on a puddle of piss and shit.

Why didn't I say anything about multiplayer? I think that question doesn't need an answer; it's all pretty self-explanatory.

To sum it up: I don't recommend this game to anyone who values ​​their time and mental health under any circumstances. For fans of trash and garbage like me... well, God be our judge."

O jogo não consegue transmitir a sensação de conquista, e desejo de zerar ele, pois não tem nenhum incentivo para isso. Não existe dinheiro nem personalização mecânica, música é só uma ou outra, sempre em constante repetição, os gráficos e os efeitos de destruição e luzes são ruins, além da jogabilidade e da física serem horrível pois os carros parecem de papel, e se comportam de forma desproporcional e sem nenhuma sensação de realismo.

Tento díl je znám tím, že je nejhorší díl z celé série, dokonce i nejhůře hodnocená hra na Steamu. A toto označení si zaslouží zcela zaslouženě. Tak zaprvé, steam stránka hry vám řiká, že čeština jako jazyk této hry není podporována, ale jakmile si hru nainstalujete a spustíte, tak je česky. Hra na to, že je z roku 2011, tak i na ultra detaily vypadá graficky naprosto odporně. Hra má několik kategorií závodů, z nichž jsou dobré max 2. Formule a mód Splatout, což je pouhé přejíždění zombíků, na čemž se nedá nic moc zkazit. Ikdyž u tvůrců této hry nevím. Tento díl už netvořilo původní studio, ale zcela jiný, který vůbec neměl potuchy, jak udělat závodní hru. Klasické závody jsou zde zcela nehratelná. Auta jezdí minimálně 200 km/h, vy a nepřátelé máte neustále doplňované turbo, což AI rádo zneužívá. Auta jsou neovladatelná a nedá se s nimi pořádně zatáčet. Tuning skoro nulový, až na jednu možnost jakého si upravení vlastností vozidla, které tak už neovladatelné vozidlo udělá ještě víc neovladatelné. Hlavně že je na výběr triliarda postav jako řidičů. Mapy jsou zbytečně dlouhé a plné zatáček. Dále je zde mód kaskadérských kousků. Je jich zde pár, ale většina z nich je o tom stejném, a to vystřelit řidiče a trefit terč přímo doprostřed. A map je zde velmi málo. Kapitolou samo o sobě je mód demoličního derby. To je asi to nejhorší z této hry. Jedna hra vám minimálně zabere čtvrt hodiny, ikdyž naboříte do nepřítele v plné rychlosti, tak mu dáte damage max 3% nebo mu to nezaznamená žádný hit, či jenom vám se odebere zdraví, jakmile se do vás nahrne několik nepřátel, tak se jen vezete, protože vás pokaždé přetočí na bok. Ve verzi pro 24 hráčů odpadne první hráč tak po 6-ti minutách. A pak zde jsou ještě Monster truck a offroad módy. Ale ty jsem vyzkoušel jen jednou a jako zbytek hry jsou špatné. Mód kariéry zde rádoby je, ale nijak víc jsem to nezkoumal. Na hře mám tak 80 minut, což je víc, než chci do téhle hry investovat. Hru mám jen díky tomu, že jsem si ji zakoupil v jednom balíčku, kde byli všechny díly série, krom čtyřky. Vyhněte se téhle hře obloukem, je to fakt žumpa. 0/10","Flatout 3 is a game from 2011 and the next part of the legendary racing series Flatout and the successor of the legendary Flatout 2 or its better version Ultimate Carnage. This installment is known for being the worst installment in the series, even the lowest rated game on Steam. And this designation is fully deserved. So first of all, the steam page of the game tells you that Czech is not supported as the language of this game, but as soon as you install and run the game, it is in Czech. For being from 2011, the game looks absolutely hideous graphically, even on ultra details. The game has several categories of races, of which max 2 are good. Formula and Splatout mode, which is just running over zombies, which you can't spoil too much. Although I don't know about the creators of this game. This part was no longer made by the original studio, but by a completely different one that had absolutely no idea how to make a racing game. Classic races are completely unplayable here. The cars go at least 200 km/h, you and the enemies have a constantly refilled turbo, which the AI ​​likes to abuse. The cars are uncontrollable and you can't turn them properly. Tuning is almost zero, except for one possibility of modifying the vehicle's properties, which will make an already uncontrollable vehicle even more uncontrollable. The main thing is that there are a trillion characters to choose from as drivers. The maps are unnecessarily long and full of turns. There is also a stunt mode. There are a few here, but most of them are about the same thing, which is to shoot the driver and hit the target right in the middle. And there are very few maps here. Demolition derby mode is a chapter in itself. That's probably the worst thing about this game. One game will take you at least a quarter of an hour, even if you run into an enemy at full speed, you will give him a maximum damage of 3%, or he will not get a hit, or you will just take away your health, as soon as several enemies pile up on you, you are just driving, because they turn you sideways every time. In the 24-player version, the first player drops out after 6 minutes. And then there are Monster truck and offroad modes. But I've only tried those once and like the rest of the game they're bad. The career mode is supposed to be here, but I haven't explored it further. I have about 80 minutes on the game, which is more than I want to invest in this game. I only have the game thanks to the fact that I bought it in one package, which included all parts of the series, except for four. Avoid this game by all means, it's a real cesspool. 0/10"

In the second, people are being stabbed with pitchforks.

""I don't want that one either.""

He opens the door to the third room, where some men are sitting at their computers, smoking and eating chips.

Positives:

     1: When you load onto the game, it uses music from your music folder, so you can choose whatever songs you wanna listen to. +1 point

     2: There is a large variety of game modes that one may find enjoyable, and that adds a lot of re-playable content. +1 point

     3: There is a large list of cars that are each unique in their own way, and you have lots of freedom in the car choice for each event. +1 point

     4: There is ingame stat tracking which is nice to know how many events you win/lose etc. +1 point

     5: The game runs at high framerates even on potato systems. +1 point

     6: The crash physics are nice. +1 point

     7: The events have lots of carnage and destruction. +1 point

     8: The AI is very forgiving which can make it easier to win if you are new to racing games. +1 point

     9: The cars feel fast. +1 point

     10: This game can help with video game addictions. +1 point

Negatives:

     1. When you load onto the game, the volume is so loud that even on the lowest settings you can't hear your friends over the game. Sometimes when you restart events, you will get ear-raped with literal train station sounds. Other times, it just sounds like you are getting a particle accelerator beam shot through your eardrums. -3 points

     2. In the ""race"" gamemode, sometimes you forget that you are in a race because the AI suck that much. In the ""stuntman"" gamemode, you try to eject your person into different areas, like mini golf. The game doesn't tell you where to aim, you have to find out yourself. In the ""battle arena"" gamemode, the AI will only target the player. You don't win a demolition derby from being last alive, you win by getting the most points. ""Big battle"" is just like the battle arena but bigger, and whenever the AI start to push you, you cannot move and it is inevitable that there will be a large pileup. In the  ""monster trucks"" gamemode, you aren't forced to use a monster truck. In the ""speed"" mode, the cars cannot even make it past 150mph. ""Nightshift"" is a gamemode where you 1v1 an AI during a foggy and rainy night. The AI can turn on a dime and you cannot see the road. You cannot win, it is near impossible. The ""offroad"" gamemode is a racing gamemode where you win by getting the most points, the cars cannot make it past 70mph either. ""Splatout is a zombie gamemode, where you kill zombies to win. The zombies have no AI, they don't move, they just stand there. ""Challenge"" is a gamemode that is just the other gamemodes, randomly selected with a random car. The other gamemodes suck, therefore this one sucks too. -19 points (-10 for each mode, and an additional -9 because challenge is all the other modes combined)

     3. The only customization is color and two premade performance kits on very specific cars. No body kits, no nothing. The car models are ass too. -3 points

     4. The ingame stat tracking doesn't work. For reference, the game says that I have 124 hours on it (not true) and says that I have lost 175.2447052002 races. I don't know how I lost a fraction of a race, I don't know how one could fuck something up this bad. -4 points

     5. A blind person would be offended with how bad this game looks. My friend could count the polygons on his fingers. He is quadriplegic, he cannot use his fingers. This game actively hurts my eyes. -3 points

     6. You could land on your roof going 100mph and the game wouldn't even crash you. You could hit a pole at 20mph and crash out. When you hit an AI, they go flying at far greater forces than what you hit them with. -3 points

     7. There are so many obstacles on the track that you cannot see the way you are meant to go. The minimap doesn't line up with the road, so you can't even use that. This is not helped by the games graphics. -3 points

     8. I forget that there are AI in some gamemodes, and I remember how bad they are in all the other gamemodes. -2 points

     9. The boost doesn't help with the acceleration. All it does is uncap your top speed and increase your FOV. When you turn, the car goes straight. If you use the handbrake, half of the time it speeds you up, and it also lets you ""turn"" around a corner. When I say ""turn"", it feels like your tires are coated in butter and you are on an ice rink, but it also feels like an formula car that is stuck to the ground with an excessive amount of downforce. The grass doesn't slow you down and has the exact same physics as the road. When you jump, the gravity pulls your nose to the ground way more than it should. It is  indescribable how bad the physics are. -10 points

     10. This game is so bad that I have PTSD every time I boot my computer. I cannot remove the icon from my desktop because I am scared that I would accidentally start the game. This game is truly awful to the point where it feels like a punishment to play. -10 points

Final score: -50/10

Final verdict: I do not recommend getting this game. I unfortunately only have the time to write 10 negatives because I scheduled many different doctor's appointments because I am afraid that this game might have given me cancer. I had to divorce my wife because this game gave me aids. This game ruined my life.

I bought the 3-part pack for fun. Of course, for the second part. I thought the third part would be at least a little better or on par with the second part, but it's complete crap. The graphics are ugly, the control physics are terrible. The music is also rubbish. I didn't see a career mode. A failure across the board! No one has made a better game than Flatout 2 in 18 years."

[h2]Veredicto de Compra[/h2]
[b]No lo compres[/b]

Con el vehículo de tus pesadillas listo para lanzarte a la aventura más frustrante de tu vida digital, recuerda — a veces el precio no justifica la experiencia, incluso si solo buscas triturar unos cuantos coches por el camino. Mejor ahorra esos billetes para algo más valioso, como unas buenas palomitas de maíz mientras ves películas de acción de los 90, al menos ahí los efectos son intencionalmente malos.","[h1]Flatout 3: Disaster on the Destruction Track[/h1]

[h2]Summary[/h2]
If you enjoy a gaming experience that makes you question your life choices every time you start the engine, then Flatout 3 may be the bad decision you're looking for. With a score that could make even the most optimistic weep, this game is a wheel-on-wheels, heart-stopping, heart-stopping festival of disappointment.

[h2]Highlights and Highlights[/h2]
- [b]Crash and Burn Baby:[/b] If you ever wanted to see your car smash into a thousand little pieces without suffering real-life consequences, this is the game for you!
- [b]Challenging Physics:[/b] What it lacks in graphics, it makes up for in physics that defy all known logic. Cars that fly higher than your hopes for fun.
- [b]Variety of Mods:[/b] There's quite a variety of modifiers in the game, though most seem to have done more harm than good.

[h2]Areas to Improve[/h2]
- [b]Everything Else:[/b] From the AI ​​to the story (was there even one?), everything seems to need a complete overhaul. Maybe starting with firing the test team (if there was one)?

With the vehicle of your nightmares ready to launch you into the most frustrating adventure of your digital life, remember — sometimes the price isn't worth the experience, even if you're just looking to crush a few cars along the way.

Ci najlepsi developerzy na świecie są mistrzami w tworzeniu elektronicznej rozgrywki!

Zacznijmy od głównego menu które jak na dłoni pokazuje jaka ta ga jest chujowa

Postacie różnią się jedynie nazwą a twórcy z Team 6 są takimi kawalarzami że postnowili stworzyć bohaterów jako parodie znanych bohaterów

Graraż to też wielkie rozczarowanie samochody nie różnią się niczym w prowadzeniu to jescze możlwości tuningu jest jak na lekarstwo

Nie mpżemy ulepszać aut jak w pierwszych częściach tylko możemy zmienić kolory na bardziej sraczkowate XD

Musimy być pierwsi w każdym wyścigu będziesz drugi? To chuj ci w dupe. Rzadnych nagród pocieszenia i medali masz być pierwszy i już!
To nie jest gra dla miekkich cipek!

Tryb Stunt - Często nie można katapultować naszego nieszczęśnika co doprowadza do obłędu, przejście jakiegokolwiek etapu graniczy z cudem.

Tryb Derby - Przeciwnicy zaprogramowani tak żeby tylko i wyłącznie nas rozwalić, njbardziej absurdalne jest to, że gdy przeciwnik nas pcha to my dostjemy więcej punktów za zadawanie obrażen.

Monster Truck - To zbiór 5 różnych konkurencji, jezdzi się nimi jak po lodzie a sami przeciwnicy zamiast wykonywać zadanie to wjeżdżają w nas utrudniając zadanie.

Model jazdy - Pojazdami steruje się jak kartonem po lodzie, fizyka również zostła zepsuta, przy każdym spotkaniu ze ścianą nasz wechikuł odbija sie jak piłka kałczukowa w losowe miejsca.
 
Podczas destrukcji auta nie widać naszej postaci! Co to kurwa jest? Samochód widmo?  Dlaczego więc na okładce dali człowieka wypadającego przez przednią szybę?, Jak w tej grze tego nie ma!

Jak można było zapomnieć o czymś takim robiąc grę ""FlatOut"" Do Chuj Pan ?! 

Czy krzaki są zrobione z jebanego betonu? (Nie wydaję mi się)  Każde spotkanie z nimi kończy się rozwaleniem pojazdu!

To teraz wisienka na torcie ""Sztuczna Inteligencja"" twórcy pod tym aspektem wyjątkowo się popisali. Bardzo często nasi przeciwnicy nawet nie zauważaj, że bierzemu udział w rozgrywce to sczcyt partactwa!

Grafika w tej grze to kastracja oczu, otoczenie tragiczne, modela kiepskie, efekty specjlne to żarty + do tegi najmocniejszy Blur jaki kiedykolwiek widziałem w grach wyścigowych w gównie takim jak to Blur został nałożony tak bardzo że nie widać niczego, nawet samej trasy (Obraz wygląda jak wymioty)

Auto to kastracja uszu nawet tego nie potrafili zrobić, a odgłosy silników przypominają zmodyfikowane kosiarki.

Optymalizacja prosi o pomstę do nieba, nie kiedy zminimalizowanie gry kończy się jej wywaleniem, ciągłe crashe i lagi, przeciwnicy nie potrafią trzymać się wyznaczonej trasy i blokują się o wszystko co jest dookoła, jakiś update z roznegliżowaną Panią Mikołaj + Mapa Moskwy ? o to kuna jest ? nawet po pobraniu tego w grze nie dostajemy zawartości tego sztrucla!  

Team 6 Powinno dostać karnego Kutasa z takie oszukiwanie graczy, gra zawodzi pod każdym względem:

Gameplay - Ssie
Model jazdy - Ssie
Grafika - Ssie 
IA - Ssie 
Cena gry - Ssie

❌","Team 6
These best developers in the world are masters of creating electronic gameplay!

Let's start with the main menu, which clearly shows how bad this game is.

The characters differ only in name, and the creators at Team 6 are such pranksters that they decided to create characters as parodies of famous characters.

The game is also a huge disappointment. The cars don't differ in handling at all, and the tuning options are scarce.

We can't upgrade cars like in the previous installments, but we can change the colors to more funky ones. XD

We have to be first in every race. Will you come second? That's a bummer. There are few consolation prizes and medals, you just have to be first, and that's it!
This isn't a game for the faint of heart!

Stunt Mode - Often, you can't eject your unfortunate opponent, which is maddening; completing any stage is a miracle.

Derby Mode - Opponents are programmed solely to destroy us. The most absurd thing is that when an opponent pushes us, we get more points for dealing damage.

Monster Truck - This is a collection of 5 different events. You drive them like they're on ice, and instead of completing the task, the opponents themselves crash into you, making the task more difficult.

Driving Model - Vehicles are controlled like cardboard on ice, and the physics are also broken. Every time you hit a wall, your vehicle bounces like a rubber ball in random places.

You can't see your character when destroying a car! What the fuck is that? A ghost car? So why did they put a man falling through the windshield on the cover? If that's not in this game!

How could they forget about something like that when making ""FlatOut""? For fuck's sake?!

Are the bushes made of fucking concrete? (I don't think so.) Every encounter with them ends with the vehicle being destroyed!

Now, the cherry on the cake: the ""Artificial Intelligence"" – the developers have done an exceptional job in this aspect. Often, our opponents don't even notice we're in the game – it's a complete mess!

The graphics in this game are a nightmare, the environments are terrible, the models are poor, and the special effects are a joke, plus the most intense blur I've ever seen in a racing game. In a piece of crap like this, the blur is so thick that you can't see anything, not even the track itself (the image looks like vomit).

The car is an earworm. They couldn't even do that, and the engine sounds resemble modified lawnmowers.

The optimization is a disgrace, not when minimizing the game crashes, constant crashes and lag, enemies can't stick to the designated route and get stuck in everything around them, some update with a sloppy Mrs. Santa Claus + a map of Moscow? What's the big deal? Even after downloading it, we don't get the content of this junk in the game!

Team 6 should be punished for cheating players like this. The game fails in every respect:

Gameplay - Sucks
Driving Model - Sucks
Graphics - Sucks
AI - Sucks
Price - Sucks
Screening - Sucks
Audio - Sucks

I can't find any merits to this shoddy work myself.

The only thing that works is the ""Uninstall"" button on ""STEAM.""

For this reason, this crap deserves the worst possible rating!

I recommend anyone who has played this for more than an hour to get an autopsy!

А теперь к минусам: что за трэшак сделали из серии дерби игр. Мало того что графика стала на порядок хуже даже чем в первой части. Отсутствие саундтреков сделало из игры еще больший шлак. Управление стало топорным и до ужаса неудобным. Не пойми зачем добавили не нужный зомби режим (ну ладно пусть что то новенькое), но как же коряво это все реализовано. Аренный режим теперь больше похоже на кашу чем на месиво. Иными словами игра свернула не туда и далеко ушла от привычного для меня Flatouta. Как я рад что раньше я в это убожество не играл. Но не смотря на все ньюансы я бы дал игре нейтральную оценку, но увы тут такой нет.

There's enough content for a lengthy playthrough.
Now, to the negatives: what a piece of trash they've turned a derby game series into. Not only are the graphics an order of magnitude worse than even the first game, but the lack of a soundtrack has made the game even worse. The controls have become clumsy and terribly awkward. I don't understand why they added an unnecessary zombie mode (well, at least it's something new), but the implementation is so clumsy. The arena mode is now more like a mush than a mess. In other words, the game has taken a wrong turn and has strayed far from the Flatout I'm used to. I'm so glad I never played this garbage before. But despite all the nuances, I would have given the game a neutral rating, but alas, that's not the case here.

Problem jest taki, że [b]Flatout 3[/b] taką grą nie jest - mało tego, reklamuje on się mianem kontynuacji ogromnej marki jaką jest [b]Flatout[/b].
Ponadto nie jest to gra darmowa - jest ona monetyzowana i kosztuje ona 44,99 polskich złotych.
Za grę przypominającą pół ԁսру zza ściany, płacimy [u][b]tyle samo[/b][/u] co za fenomenalny sandbox jakim jest [b]Garry's Mod[/b].
Grę jedynie polecam kupić w momencie w którym planujemy sobie z niej się pośmiać ze znajomymi na Discordzie, spróbować w to zagrać bez wykrzaczeń do pulpitu w ilości sztuk 6-7 na godzinę, po czym ją zwrócić, zanim przekroczymy magiczną liczbę 2 godzin playtime'u.
W każdym innym wypadku gra nie jest warta chociażby złotówki a kupowanie jej licząc na faktycznie dobry gameplay jest zwyczajnie głupie.

The game isn't the worst product, but that doesn't change the fact that it's [b]bad[/b].
The game doesn't even come close to being as good as its two predecessors in terms of quality. It's more like a browser game, and if that were the reality of this game's existence, it wouldn't be bad.
The problem is that [b]Flatout 3[/b] isn't that kind of game – what's more, it advertises itself as a sequel to the huge franchise that is [b]Flatout[/b].

Furthermore, it's not a free-to-play game – it's monetized and costs 44.99 Polish zloty.

For a game that resembles half a next-door game, we pay [u][b]the same[/b][/u] as the phenomenal sandbox that is [b]Garry's Mod[/b]. I only recommend buying the game if you plan to laugh about it with friends on Discord, try to play it without crashing at 6-7 times per hour, and then return it before you reach the magical 2 hours of playtime.
In any other case, the game isn't worth a penny, and buying it with the expectation of actually having good gameplay is simply foolish.

Моё сравнение опирается на первые две части игр из этой серии. Такое чувство что предыдущие части были намного лучше оптимизированы и сбалансированнее. Также в предыдущих частях управления было более удобным и плавным. За какой аспект игры не возьмись, то эта часть во всём будет уступать предыдущим, что очень странно ибо время вроде бы прошло, но вместо улучшений мы получили дебаффы.

Чтобы не повторяться поговорим о озвучке, в этой игре она на ощущения хуже чем в предыдущих. Просто банальное прохождение всех челенджей и уровней с гонками уже для вас будет испытание за счёт кривой работы самой игры. Насладится игрой за те 40 часов я так и не смог и считаю что это признак халтуры со стороны разработчиков.

В игре отсутствуют коллекционные карточки, но в то же время есть достижения, но их выполнение невыносимо муторное за счёт кривого управления, поэтому здесь так же без плюсов

My comparison is based on the first two games in this series. It feels like the previous games were much better optimized and balanced. The controls in the previous games were also more convenient and smooth. No matter what aspect of the game you tackle, this one feels inferior to the previous ones, which is very strange, because time has passed, but instead of improvements, we've received debuffs.

To avoid repetition, let's talk about the voice acting in this game; it feels worse than in the previous ones. Simply completing all the challenges and racing levels will be a challenge due to the game's poor performance. I still couldn't enjoy the game in those 40 hours, and I think this is a sign of poor work on the part of the developers.

The game lacks collectible cards, but it does have achievements, but completing them is excruciatingly tedious due to the clunky controls, so there are no redeeming features here either.

Плюсы:

Геймплей - играя на лёгком, в целом приятно. Но когда начинаешь выставлять сложность выше, становиться больно.

Машины - модели и текстуры мне понравились.

Физика - думал будет хуже, а т.к я к ней быстро привык, мне она зашла. Кроме мокрых трасс. Вот там физика ужасна.

Трассы - невероятно, но трассы лёгкие и в целом, к ним быстро привыкаешь. Трассы мне понравились, красивые.

Управление - однако, думал будет хуже. Некоторые машины отлично входят в повороты. А некоторые нет.

Короткие пути - это 1 часть Flatout, где они работают идеально. СПАСИБО РАЗРАБАМ!

Спорные моменты:

Графика - с одной стороны, мне понравилась. НО! Засветы и проблемы с тенями портят всё.

Режимы - есть некоторые режимы аля Зомби давить (Earn To Die в 3D), гонки. А вот дерби и ночные гонки отвратны, ой, а ночные гонки вообще бред собачий. Противник спавниться далеко от тебя использует нитру и улетает далеко, а ты как хочешь так и догоняй (Привет, Flatout).

Оптимизация - на Windows 10 LTSC 21H2 x64 запустилось со 2 раза, после вылетов не было. Фпс конечно дропался, только в замесах на дерби.

Минусы:

Карьера - а точнее её отсутствие. Если в Flatout и Flatout 2 была карьера, была мотивация играть. А здесь? Ну поставил я на лёгкой и 1 круг. Прошёл быстро. А трасс мало... В итоге считай игра пройдена за 3.4 часа.

Техническая часть - ну я банально не смог настроить тонко графику, т.к нажимая стрелочку вниз, я не мог нажать ""Да"". А теперь самый сок. ИНДЕКС ПРОИЗВОДИТЕЛЬНОСТИ Windows в 2011 году... Игра опирается на данный индекс, который извините меня, мёртворождённый. Пропадали некоторые тени на локации. Прогрузки прямо перед лицом. Беда первой и второй части.

ИИ - всё такой-же спорный и глупый. (Все те-же проблемы первой и второй части).

Итог: можно поиграть играя на лёгкой сложности и поставив самый малый коэффициент разрушаемости (я так и сделал) с удовольствием. На вечерок один. А так, очень много проблем. Но мне зашло. Это не Flatout. А другая игра. Здесь не чувствуется духа Flatout. В некоторых моментах разработчики исправили проблемы прошлых частей, но не во всех.","Flatout 3: Chaos & Destruction is not Flatout.

Pros:

Gameplay - playing on Easy is generally enjoyable. But when you start turning the difficulty up, it becomes painful.

Cars - I liked the models and textures.

Physics - I thought it would be worse, but since I got used to it quickly, I liked it. Except on wet tracks. The physics there are terrible.

Tracks - incredible, but the tracks are easy and overall, you get used to them quickly. I liked the tracks; they're beautiful.

Controls - however, I thought they would be worse. Some cars corner perfectly. Some don't.

Shortcuts - this is the first part of Flatout, where they work perfectly. THANKS TO THE DEVELOPERS!

Controversial points:

Graphics - on the one hand, I liked it. BUT! The glare and shadow issues ruin everything.

Modes - There are some modes like Zombie Crush (Earn To Die in 3D), and racing. But derby and night races are terrible, and the night races are just plain crap. The enemy spawns far away from you, uses nitrous, and flies away, and you have to chase them down (Hello, Flatout).

Optimization - On Windows 10 LTSC 21H2 x64, it launched on the second try, and there were no crashes after that. FPS did drop, of course, only in derby skirmishes.

Cons:

Career - or rather, the lack thereof. If Flatout and Flatout 2 had a career, there was motivation to play. But what about this? Well, I set it to easy and did one lap. I finished it quickly. But there aren't enough tracks... In the end, I finished the game in 3.4 hours.

The technical part - well, I simply couldn't fine-tune the graphics settings, because pressing the down arrow wouldn't click ""Yes."" And now the best part. The Windows PERFORMANCE INDEX in 2011... The game relies on this index, which, excuse me, is stillborn. Some shadows in the area disappeared. Loading sequences were right in front of your face. A problem with the first and second games.

The AI ​​is still just as questionable and stupid. (All the same problems with the first and second games).

Bottom line: you can play on easy difficulty and set the destruction factor to the lowest (which is what I did) with pleasure. It's good for an evening. Otherwise, there are a lot of problems.

Неплохо бы совместить воедино, взять от обоих самое лучшее, от 3-й части идею, новые виды трасс, гонок и испытаний. 

Но в итоге имеем то, что имеем. Кучу ошибок, даже вылетает периодически на вин 11. Не говоря о никаком тестировании своих же гонок теми, кто игру создавал. Кое-где выиграть кажется нереально. Помогает ""Cheat Engine"" и совет из сообщества на трасса со школьными автобусами. Кое-где соперники тупы как пробки - на скорости не могут вписаться в любой поворот и вы даже на медленном танке пройдёте 3 круга быстрее. 

Режим испытаний - своего рода режим прохождения, имеет очень завышенный показатель повреждений вашей машине при любых касаниях чего угодно крупного (соперники, стоящие, никого не трогающие машины). Зачастую вы просто не сможете одолеть все 3/3 кругов живым. Ну ладно, это можно пережить, фиг знает с какой попытки, но можно.

Физика никакущая. Со 2-м или 4-м флатаутом не сравнится.
В общем, минус тут, минус на минусе. Игра делалась на скорую руку.","The idea is great. The execution sucks. Bugbear should have taken over the production of Part 3, because Part 2 is, in my opinion, the best.
It would be nice to combine them, take the best from both, including the idea from Part 3, new types of tracks, races, and challenges.

But in the end, we have what we have. Tons of bugs, even crashes occasionally on Windows 11. Not to mention the game's creators' extensive testing of their own races. In some places, winning seems impossible. The ""Cheat Engine"" and advice from the community on the school bus track help. In some places, the opponents are as dumb as a log—at speed, they can't negotiate any corner, and even a slow tank will take you three laps faster.

Challenge mode—a sort of completion mode—has a greatly inflated damage rate for your car when it touches anything large (opponents, stationary cars, and cars that aren't touching anyone). Often, you simply won't be able to make it through all 3/3 of the circles alive. Oh well, you can survive that, who knows how many tries it takes, but you can.

The physics are terrible. It doesn't compare to the 2nd or 4th flatout.
Basically, it's a minus here, a minus on top of a minus. The game was rushed together."

Right off the bat, before I even loaded up the game, I ran into a bug. Apparently, there's an error when starting up this game that affects some users, all depending on their system, or more likely, chance. I attempted to install this on my original PC I played most of my steam games on for the last several years. And it simply wouldn't work.
 I tried many work arounds but nothing worked. 
Lo and behold, I forgot I installed this on my new PC. And it did work, no problems at all. Except well, when I began playing.

It's almost overwhelming when you compare what this game achieves and well, is objectively compared to the two prior titles in the franchise. Overwhelming in the face of what this series began as, and how the new development team went about in the third full entry into the series. It feels like it's supposed to be a mockery of the games that came out just about 5 years prior to this one. 
I struggle to see how this is even related to Flatout, other than feeling like a fan-fiction made by borrowing elements of the prior games without capturing the true game mechanics and atmosphere. It genuinely reminds me of a mobile game, like Candy Crush. Or Angry Birds. Except this game makes one feel more like an Angry Bird when playing this game which should've had top honours in the equivalent of the Golden Raspberry Awards for videogames of 2011.
I can't find a single thing to praise this game for, for in every regard, it feels like a step, naw, a sprint backwards. 
I've had more fun playing flash games. I tried every gamemode to give myself the full experience, and cannot for the life of me understand the thinking that went into development and release of this.

Considering the developers went into mobile game development, why am I not surprised that this feels like an IP for the mobile gaming market. Heck, they already inserted the ragdoll mechanics into a mobile format.

I did have fun. The AI is terrible and the rubber-banding is strong, sometimes the enemies will drift at top speed around corners and the graphics OMG.... the bloom is so obnoxious and the game is so orange you might go blind. The physics is so bad, especially when jumping ramps and the collision detection.... and you might clip something you can barely tell is an obstacle that will end your race. 

On the upside, you can set career mode events to one lap, meaning you can charge through most races in under a minute and not lose a lot when you restart maybe. Flatout 3 did make an effort to carry on the legacy of the previous entries with the additional content and bonus modes and there are some fun to be had there but you wish there was more and that some of the events were better executed.

The soundtrack which has been a hall mark of the identity of the series returns with equal aplomb, with lesser known artist than the previous installment, but although a mixed bag of wailing rock and energetic numbers, I believe has been well-received by those that hold the game near and dear to their heart...

Doing reviews for an old forgotten game like this might be a bit redundant now as racing games and technologies have progressed, but to take a moment to appreciate the nostalgia and to see where we've come from. Honestly a big part of the negative reception to this game was the high expectations set by its predecessors and part of me wants to appreciate the spirit with which the series was attempted to be carried on here.

As with some genres, we've seen a decline in range in car combat games, like arena shooters maybe as well, I mean there's like three good ones and infinite bad ones where there is that perception that people will never get tired of tried-and-tested classics and the consensus usually ends up being why don't we see more of these games, but secretly we know these genres and recent attempts have been stale and subpar and boring and met with indifference in the greater market.

In that I think this game does deserve recognition in what it tries to be, and despite its numerous technical flaws, I find myself asking if I would play this if its the only game I have and the answer is yes.

(Also seen a price increase recently and is now three times more expensive than I payed. There is an issue brooding over pricing in games. Its not what it costs but what you can make people pay.... In that there is a caveat of 'Its good depending what you pay' which is unprovisioned in reviews systems unless explicitly mentioned.)","MEME REVIEW: Have to downvote to continue this game's legacy as one of the worst rated games on Steam, however.......

Buy it if you want to gain a deeper appreciation of how other racing games and developers do a comparatively godly job with AI, car handling, track design (with decent signposting), graphics and audio. 

Seriously, you will come to admire how well other racing games lead your eye around the track to give you an idea where you're going. This game has an infamous reputation and it's fully deserving of the criticisms thrown at it. Yet perversely, I have had some entertainment out of it as a cheap knockabout racer, albeit one that appears to have been thrown together with little testing.

Made by Team 6 (not Bugbear like the previously well regarded entries in the series), this feels like a shovelware PS2/Wii game. I can only assume that the 6 in the developer's name refers to either the amount of devs they put on the game or the maximum time in months they took to develop it; probably both. It comes across like a quickly churned out knockoff that fails to grasp (or replicate) what made the originals so enjoyable - merely existing to cynically leverage the brand name at the time. 

Received as part of the complete pack, I thought I'd give it a go after Ultimate Carnage (the game I really wanted to play) refused to start up. I wasn't expecting much (which it delivers on) but it is possible to get some fun out of it for a while despite all that is shonky, broken and just bad. There is certainly some chaos and destruction to be had, some of the cars handle okay-ish and changing the speed in races to 'classic' instead of default makes things a little more manageable. There's enough modes to keep you occupied a while but none feel like they've had enough attention or refinement.

I wouldn't even recommend it to achievement hunters as some of them are tied to seemingly impossible tasks that are more likely to come down to luck - some of the stunt events feel broken due to the unhelpful camera/physics, and the night races with magical rain that sometimes lands in the air several feet above the road surface, appear to be filled with opposition that can supernaturally whizz and boost around the track as if guided by a divine hand.

It's a shame the brand got lumbered with this sequel, just enjoy the first 2 games and/or Flatout: Ultimate Carnage (an updated version of Flatout 2) instead - they're a lot of fun (the 2nd being perhaps one of my favourite racers).","Replace the 'FL' in the game title with 'SH' and you get a perfectly succinct descriptor of what this game feels like.

While it may have divided opinions, there's no denying the adrenaline-fueled excitement that this installment brings to the table.

One of the standout features of FlatOut 3 is its sheer commitment to over-the-top destruction. The crashes are spectacular, and the debris scattered across the track adds a layer of unpredictability, keeping every race intense and unpredictable. The variety of environments, from urban landscapes to off-road tracks, adds a refreshing change of scenery and ensures that no two races feel the same.

The vehicle customization options are a welcome addition, allowing players to tweak and modify their cars to suit their preferred racing style. The expansive roster of vehicles provides a diverse range of choices, each with its own strengths and quirks, adding an extra layer of strategy to the gameplay.

Multiplayer modes contribute significantly to the game's replay value. Competing against friends or online opponents in the chaotic races or destructive derbies is an absolute blast. The multiplayer component enhances the social aspect of the game, turning every race into a shared experience of laughter and competition.

While the game may not adhere to the strictest simulation standards, its focus on delivering pure, unadulterated fun is evident. The soundtrack complements the fast-paced action perfectly, enhancing the overall immersive experience.

In conclusion, FlatOut 3: Chaos & Destruction is a game that revels in its commitment to delivering an action-packed, destructive racing experience.

The high-speed, chaotic races and the ability to wreck opponents' cars in spectacular fashion are undeniably entertaining. The game's focus on destruction and mayhem provides a unique and adrenaline-pumping twist to the racing genre. It's a blast to unleash your inner road rage and wreak havoc on the track.

However, the glaring downside to FlatOut 3 lies in its graphical department. The visuals are nothing short of mediocre, even when considering the time of its release. The textures are often dull, and the overall presentation lacks the polish and finesse that gamers have come to expect in modern titles. If you're a stickler for high-quality graphics, you might be disappointed by the underwhelming visuals.

But perhaps the most frustrating aspect of the game is its stability. It's no exaggeration to say that I was fortunate to get onto the game twice. Frequent crashes mar the experience, making it difficult to enjoy the game without frustration. This is a significant letdown, as a game with such potential for enjoyment is hampered by these technical issues.

In conclusion, FlatOut 3 is a game with a split personality. It offers an exhilarating and fun racing experience with its unique focus on destruction, but this is marred by underwhelming graphics and a maddeningly unstable performance. If you're willing to overlook these shortcomings and enjoy the chaos of racing mayhem, it might be worth a shot.

Нет смысла иронизировать по поводу данной игры, так как всем уже давно известно, что эрзац Flat Out 3 - лютый кал опоссума, разрабы которого решили бесчестно заработать на имени предшественника, что подарил людям безбашенный дерби-стритрейсинг симулятор, который многие все так знают, помнят, любят и поди еще играют/переигрывают.
Игра шла по скидке и стоила мне буквально проезд на маршрутке туда и обратно, поэтому решил уже полностью распробовать сею ""вредную халяву"", так как будучи тинейджером мой вердикт был весьма быстрым и резким после двух гонок, а тут я могу уже с головой погрузиться и понять во второй и последний раз что-с-этой-игрой-действительно-не-так.
Но коль минусы и шутки уже были пропущены раз 100, я все же выделюсь и скажу единственный плюс, который все-таки заметил в этой заблюренной, фризящей работе студента старших курсов политеха: 
Если не считать свистнутые дерби, трюки и классические кольцевые гонки, то в ""Flatout 3"" всё же есть прикольные режимы а-ля командные гонки на бигфутах или дуэли с плохой видимостью и маятниками-объектами, что могут создать соревновательный интерес и на изи заруинить лидерство или всю гонку. Разумеется, если бы сей продукт был доведен до ума.
Если бы эта игра вышла включительно до 2007-го или максимум до 2008-го года и под другим, своим именем; если бы разработчики чууууть-чуть пофиксили физику и убрали бы те самые упомянутые мною блюр-фризы, то, поди, игрушка, если бы не заняла лидерскую позицию в игровых журналах и сайтах, то точно бы о ней отзывались положительно и та  точно бы имела свою аудиторию дегустаторов и даже фанбазу.
PS: я эту ср#нь пытался запустить несколько раз, так как мне выдавало ошибку. Пришлось скачать патч из одного топика по данной проблеме, который так же не помог. Однако раза с 5-го игра все же перестала меня выплевывать как кита на берег. Даже создатели, судя по всему, предупреждают пользователя о том, что лучше этот игровой снафф не запускать. 
Все же не сдержался и пошутил, увы...","[h1] ""One of the best hours of my life"" [/h1]

There's no point in being sarcastic about this game, since everyone already knows that the ersatz Flat Out 3 is a raging possum's dung, whose developers decided to dishonestly cash in on the name of its predecessor, which gave people the crazy derby-street racing simulator that many people know, remember, love, and probably still play/replay.
The game was on sale and literally cost me a round-trip bus ride, so I decided to fully experience this ""harmful freebie."" As a teenager, my verdict was quite quick and harsh after two races, but here I can dive in and figure out for the second and final time what's really wrong with this game. But since the flaws and jokes have already been overlooked a hundred times, I'll still stand out and point out the only positive I did notice in this blurry, freezing work by a senior polytechnic student:

Aside from the whistled demolition derbies, stunts, and classic circuit racing, ""Flatout 3"" does have some cool modes, like team racing on Bigfoot trucks or duels with poor visibility and pendulum-like objects, that can create competitive interest and easily ruin the lead or the entire race. Of course, if this product had been polished properly.
If this game had been released before 2007, or at most before 2008, and under a different, original name; If the developers had just tweaked the physics a little and removed those blurry freezes I mentioned, the game, even if it hadn't become a leader in gaming magazines and websites, would definitely have received positive reviews and would have definitely found its audience and even a fan base.
PS: I tried running this piece of crap several times because I kept getting an error. I had to download a patch from a thread about this issue, which also didn't help. However, after about the fifth try, the game finally stopped throwing me out like a whale on the beach. Even the creators, apparently, warn users against running this game snuff.

But none of it works; the racers are ridiculous skins with two lines of description. The tracks are inverted, a graphical mess thanks to a poor filter. Competitions and challenges are completely uninteresting due to poor AI, and most importantly, the abysmal physics. For the first time, I found it boring to smash through the environment, opponents, and even run over zombies. The cars are just troughs on wheels; even in the first game, they're visually inferior.

The gap in quality between Flatout 2 and Flatout 3 is astounding. I can only assume that everyone at Bugbear was in a coma and they passed the third game onto a group of blind baboons that don't have arms. 

I don't have to talk about the game play because it doesn't have any. Unlike other arcade racing games, Flatout 3 fails to inspire a competitive atmosphere. Burnout, Need For Speed, SplitSecond are all games that encourage you to perform better because not only can you actually understand why you would be winning or losing, but also because winning in those games makes you feel cool, because those are cool games. Flatout 3 isn't cool, it's really lame, with characters that are ugly and 1 dimensional. With all the different car options in the game it would make you think there was much of a difference in how each class plays. Nope. apart from the speed class, most classes feel very similar in terms of handling and strength. Not to mention that winning or losing doesn't have as much player agency as it should. You could win a race with zero effort or get your ass pummeled by every other racer coming after you specifically. The AI are able to take turns far better than you because of the whackass physics. But it's not like that matters because the AI is so stupid they will routinely crash into obstacles, and on the monster truck open map type of game, the AI trucks basically just drive in circles.

The game doesn't even function properly. Not only does the game crash every time you launch it and will continue to do so several times, but after trying over and over just to start you get ""rewarded"" with the worst racing game experience on earth. The automatic soundtrack option in settings is to take music from your music folder. That isn't actually a bad idea because it makes the soundtrack custom to the person playing. This has some issues however. If the player's music isn't fast paced or exciting (e.g they listen to Bob Dylan) it can lead to the music not matching the game. The other problem is far worse though, because I for instance didn't have any music in my music folder. So the game had no music at all. Given that most people listen to music on portable devices such as phones, and if they have music on a computer they likely use spodify or some other app, it wouldn't make sense for everybody who played this game to have their own soundtrack. (Also it is likely that the devs added this feature so that they didn't have to make the ost or pay someone to do it.) 

In conclusion avoid this game, other wise you might as well set the money on fire and piss on it.","This game is the virtual equivalent of leprosy, it makes you miserable, it makes other people avoid you, and you really wish you didn't have it. The gap in quality between Flatout 2 and Flatout 3 is astounding. I can only assume that everyone at Bugbear was in a coma and they passed the third game onto a group of blind baboons that don't have arms. 

I don't have to talk about the game play because it doesn't have any. Unlike other arcade racing games, Flatout 3 fails to inspire a competitive atmosphere. Burnout, Need For Speed, SplitSecond are all games that encourage you to perform better because not only can you actually understand why you would be winning or losing, but also because winning in those games makes you feel cool, because those are cool games. Flatout 3 isn't cool, it's really lame, with characters that are ugly and 1 dimensional. With all the different car options in the game it would make you think there was much of a difference in how each class plays. Nope. apart from the speed class, most classes feel very similar in terms of handling and strength. Not to mention that winning or losing doesn't have as much player agency as it should. You could win a race with zero effort or get your ass pummeled by every other racer coming after you specifically. The AI are able to take turns far better than you because of the whackass physics. But it's not like that matters because the AI is so stupid they will routinely crash into obstacles, and on the monster truck open map type of game, the AI trucks basically just drive in circles.

The game doesn't even function properly. Not only does the game crash every time you launch it and will continue to do so several times, but after trying over and over just to start you get ""rewarded"" with the worst racing game experience on earth. The automatic soundtrack option in settings is to take music from your music folder. That isn't actually a bad idea because it makes the soundtrack custom to the person playing. This has some issues however. If the player's music isn't fast paced or exciting (e.g they listen to Bob Dylan) it can lead to the music not matching the game. The other problem is far worse though, because I for instance didn't have any music in my music folder. So the game had no music at all.

Hat seine negativen Reviews definitiv verdient, kann aber auch ganz lustig sein, solange man nicht komplett an den Gamebugs scheitert.

Update: Nach ungefähr 20 Spielstunden konnte ich alle Erfolge, die dieses tolle Spiel zu bieten hat, freischalten. Der Weg dorthin grenzt aber an Selbstgeiselung, also sollte man sich davor gut überlegen, welches Spiel man hier besiegen will...
Die KI fährt teilweise gesamte Rennen mit perfekter Fahrtrajektorie und man hat überhaupt keine Chance, dagegen anzukommen. Oft muss man das Rennen neustarten, bis die KI für das eine Rennen schwächer ist und dann hoffen, dass die FPS-Einbrüche während dem Rennen nicht am nächsten Baum enden und man demoliert wird.
Dazu gibt es Challenges (19 und 30), die unmöglich zu schaffen sind, wenn man nicht den Gamecode ändert, 3 Stunden neustartet und betet oder wie in Challenge 19 die Strecke in Gegenrichtung(!) befährt, weil eine Rampe sonst nicht befahrbar ist. Bei anderen Herausforderungen muss der Spielmodus auf ,,schnell"" gewechselt werden, um z.B. Stunts zu schaffen.
Man könnte meinen, die ""Developer"" hätten ihr eigenes Spiel nicht einmal selbst getestet, solche groben Fehler sind wirklich peinlich, selbst für FlatOut3.

Fazit: Man kann das Spiel spielen, wenn man Lust hat, sich mit einem von vorn bis hinten grauenhaften Spiel durchzukämpfen, das bei mir beim Starten jedes Mal den zweiten Bildschirm deaktiviert hat.
Auch wenn es teilweise Spaß macht, sollte man das Spiel nicht dafür positiv bewerten, denn es ist und bleibt Müll.","The game is only useful if you're specifically looking for the worst garbage the racing genre has to offer.

It definitely deserves its negative reviews, but it can also be quite fun as long as you don't completely fail due to the game's bugs.

Update: After about 20 hours of play, I was able to unlock all the achievements this great game has to offer. However, the path to getting there borders on self-flagellation, so you should carefully consider which game you're trying to beat...
The AI ​​sometimes drives entire races with perfect driving trajectories, and you have absolutely no chance of beating it. You often have to restart the race until the AI ​​is weaker for that race, and then hope that the FPS drops during the race don't end up hitting the nearest tree and destroying you.
There are also challenges (19 and 30) that are impossible to complete unless you change the game code, restart for three hours and pray, or, as in Challenge 19, drive the track in the opposite direction(!) because a ramp is otherwise impassable. For other challenges, you have to switch the game mode to ""quick"" to perform stunts, for example.
You'd think the ""developers"" hadn't even tested their own game; such glaring mistakes are truly embarrassing, even for FlatOut3.

Conclusion: You can play the game if you want to struggle through a game that is awful from start to finish and that disabled the second screen every time I started it.
Even if it's fun at times, you shouldn't rate the game positively for that, because it is and remains garbage."

Flatout 3 Chaos & Destruction ist der dritte Teil der beliebten Rennspielserie, diesmal entwickelt von Team6 Game Studios. Das Spiel verspricht rasante Action, Zerstörung und Adrenalin pur. Verspricht... Chaos & Destruction war wohl die Zielsetzung um die Reihe zu begraben.

Wisst Ihr was, es lohnt sich nicht, dieses Spiel auch nur zu erwähnen.
Daher werde ich auch nichts zu dieser Gurke schreiben.

Hier, Ihr möchtet euch die Liebe eurer Kollegen erkaufen? Dann ein Rezept für einen Kuchen den ich immer mal wieder backe und Arbeitskollegen in Heuschrecken verwandelt!

[h1]Käsekuchen mit Brownie-Boden[/h1]

[i]Für den Boden[/i]
120g Butter
150g Mehl
120g Zartbitter (2/3 70% 1/3 80% meine Mischung)
220g Feinstzucker
2 Eier, verquirlt
60ml Milch

[i]Für den Käsekuchen[/i]
500g Frischkäse oder Quark 40% (QUARK!!!)
150g hellbrauner Feinstzucker
3 Eier, verquirlt
1 Tütchen Vanillezucker
125g Naturjoghurt

Ofen auf 180° vorheizen, Springform einfetten und mit Mehl bestäuben.

Butter mit Schokolade in einem kleinen Topf bei geringer Hitze schmelzen und verrühren. Vom Herd nehmen und Zucker einrühren. Eier mit Milch kräftig unterrühren. Das Mehl darübersieben und unterheben. Ab in die Form und für 25 Minuten backen.
Aus dem Ofen nehmen, auf 160° stellen und jetzt die Käsekuchenschicht zubereiten, währen der Boden leicht abkühlt.
Frischkäse (bäh!) oder Quark mit Zucker, Eiern und Vaniellezucker gut mischen. Den Joghurt rein und auf dem Boden verteilen.
Weitere 45-55 Minuten backen. Kuchen vom Rand lösen und abkühlen lassen. Mindestens 4 Stunden oder über Nacht in den Kühlschrank stellen, dann erst in Stücke schneiden.

Fazit: Nun doch nochmal ganz kurz zu Flatout 3, es enttäuscht auf vielen Ebenen. Die schwache Grafik, das unausgereifte Gameplay und das uninspirierte Streckendesign lassen das Spiel im Vergleich zu seinen Vorgängern weit zurückfallen.

Von mir eine 5/5 für den Kuchen!","[b]Flatout 3 - A Disappointing Chapter in the Flatout Series[/b]

Flatout 3 Chaos & Destruction is the third installment in the popular racing game series, this time developed by Team6 Game Studios. The game promises fast-paced action, destruction, and pure adrenaline. Promises... Chaos & Destruction was probably the goal to bury the series.

You know what? It's not even worth mentioning this game.
Therefore, I won't write anything about this dud.

Here, you want to buy the love of your colleagues? Then here's a recipe for a cake I bake every now and then that turns coworkers into locusts!

[h1]Cheesecake with Brownie Base[/h1]

[i]For the base[/i]
120g butter
150g flour
120g dark chocolate (2/3 70%, 1/3 80% my mix)
220g caster sugar
2 eggs, beaten
60ml milk

[i]For the cheesecake[/i]
500g cream cheese or quark 40% (QUARK!!!)
150g light brown caster sugar
3 eggs, beaten
1 sachet vanilla sugar
125g natural yogurt

Preheat oven to 180°C (350°F), grease a springform pan and dust with flour.

Melt the butter and chocolate in a small saucepan over low heat and stir to combine. Remove from the heat and stir in the sugar. Whisk in the eggs and milk vigorously. Sift the flour over the top and fold in. Place in the pan and bake for 25 minutes.
Remove from the oven, set the oven to 160°C, and prepare the cheesecake layer while the base cools slightly.
Mix the cream cheese (yuck!) or quark with the sugar, eggs, and vanilla sugar. Add the yogurt and spread it on the base.
Bake for another 45-55 minutes. Loosen the cake from the sides and let it cool. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight, then cut into slices.

Conclusion: A quick word about Flatout 3 again; it disappoints on many levels. The weak graphics, the underdeveloped gameplay, and the uninspired track design mean the game falls far short of its predecessors.

I give it a 5/5!"

The music is simply beyond praise, it's simply not there. In the previous games, every track was brilliant, but here it's simply not there. It's only in the main menu.
The gameplay is also a bummer, it's fucking garbage and buggy.
They added modes that nobody knows how or why anyone uses and don't work properly without intervention, like the stuntman mode, which is completely incomprehensible. Or the night race mode, which... just launches night tracks, fucking crap, Formula 1, what the hell is Formula 1 in flatout? The zombie props are worthless, they're just garbage. In every fucking mode, you can randomly get fucked up at the start or fly off into the sky, because that's how it is.

In short, the game isn't even free.

They squeezed the most out of it because they had no budget and their sponsors screwed them over more than once!
The game isn't that terrible!
P.S. The game initially throws a C++ file error. This can be easily fixed. Go to the game's installation folder, find the DirectX folder, open it, find dxsetup, and install it. (Not at all, ungrateful pigs.)

Вкупе с отвратительной физикой, когда ты на полной скорости врезаешься в соперника и либо он подлетает ровно вверх, либо ты проезжаешь по нему не нанеся ни одной единицы урона. Как такое может называться FlatOut? Единственное, что вполне прикольно - это зомби-режим, но из-за кривизны игры очень сложно получить в нем удовольствие. Говоря про музыку - дешево записанный рок, который никак не запомнится, и то не факт, что услышишь его из-за слишком громких звуков в гонке. Никаких Nickelback, Papa Roach, Amplifire или даже No Connection. Даже вокала нет. Ни о чем.
Короче, если вы кого-то очень сильно ненавидите - купите ему этот шлак, а себе даже не вздумайте. Не повторяйте моих ошибок.","A completely unplayable piece of crap. You can't even call it a regular racing game, let alone FlatOut. The cars drive like they're on ice and crash like toys. Combined with the atrocious physics, when you crash into an opponent at full speed, they either fly straight up or you drive over them without doing a single point of damage—how can this even be called FlatOut? The only thing that's quite cool is the zombie mode, but the game's clunkiness makes it incredibly difficult to enjoy. Speaking of the music, it's cheaply recorded rock that's completely forgettable, and you're unlikely to even hear it over the excessively loud racing sounds. No Nickelback, Papa Roach, Amplifire, or even No Connection. There aren't even any vocals. Nothing special.
Basically, if you really hate someone, buy them this garbage, but don't even think about it for yourself. Don't make the same mistakes I did."

El juego no es la basura más grande del mundo de los videojuegos como la plantean algunos, yo diría incluso que lo podría poner como decente, pasable, aprobado por casi nada. Tiene una jugabilidad por lo menos divertida y rápida, tus oponentes tienen una forma de conducción temeraria típica de la saga flatout ( al menos si hablamos desde el 2 para adelante ), forma de conducción que hace a un más divertido el gameplay; tiene modos de juego muy divertidos, desde el clásico modo carrera, asta una carrera de demolición, etc; los gráficos viendo la época de salida del juego no destacan en nada, de echo diría incluso que son feos, y la iluminación es algo tosca, pero bueno esto es algo que afecta más a lo visual; tiene una gran variedad de autos, algunos muy distintos, y gracias a qué es un juego sin licencias, se toma algunas libertades al crear algunos modelos de autos, que quedan por lo menos interesantes... Y por último y para finalizar, el juego cuenta con un rendimiento bastante decente, osea que el mismo puede correr en una gran variedad de PC, a un que recomiendo que si tú PC es de bajos recursos, baja la resolución ya que eso debería solucionar por completo el bajón de FPS.

Les recomiendo que jueguen primero este título de la saga flatout, antes que el resto, por qué de jugar a los anteriores, se darán cuenta que este esta a años luz de siquiera llegarles a los talones. Jueguen primero el Flatout 3, después el Flatout 1, después el Flatout 4, después el Flatout 2 y por último el Flatout Ultimate Carnage ( a un que si juegan por último el 2 tampoco habrá problema, ya que ese en mi opinión es el mejor de todos ).

Si cambio de opinión está reseña será actualizada inmediatamente, así que confíen en mí.","As you may have noticed, I haven't played much time, but I'll do this review anyway. The game isn't the biggest piece of garbage in the video game world as some people make it out to be, I'd even say I could put it as decent, passable, approved for almost nothing. It has at least fun and fast gameplay, your opponents have a reckless driving style typical of the Flatout saga (at least if we're talking about the 2 onwards), a way of driving that makes the gameplay more fun; it has very fun game modes, from the classic career mode, to a demolition race, etc.; the graphics considering the time the game was released don't stand out at all, in fact I'd even say they're ugly, and the lighting is somewhat crude, but hey, this is something that affects the visuals more; It has a wide variety of cars, some very different, and thanks to the fact that it's a license-free game, it takes some liberties when creating some car models, which are at least interesting. And finally, the game has pretty decent performance, meaning it can run on a wide variety of PCs. I recommend that if your PC is low-end, lower the resolution, as that should completely fix the FPS drop.

I recommend playing this title in the Flatout series first, before the rest, because if you play the previous ones, you'll realize that this one is light years away from even coming close. Play Flatout 3 first, then Flatout 1, then Flatout 4, then Flatout 2, and finally Flatout Ultimate Carnage (although if you play the 2nd one last, it won't be a problem either, since that one, in my opinion, is the best of the lot).

If I change my mind, this review will be updated immediately, so trust me."

Меня удивило что в этой игре очень много контента, но какой в этом смысл если геймплей и графика просто ужасны? 
Единственный режим который ненадолго смог меня увлечь это SPLATOUT, где нужно давить зомби
Впрочем оставлю положительный отзыв, хотя бы потому что вместе со сборником эта игра почти бесплатная на распродаже да и без меня отрицательных отзывов вполне достаточно

They've simply disgraced my beloved FlatOut series. What did publisher Strategy First expect by handing the game over to Team 6 Studios, the same team that created the unsuccessful port of the first FlatOut to the Wii?
I was surprised that this game has so much content, but what's the point if the gameplay and graphics are simply terrible?

The only mode that briefly captivated me was SPLATOUT, where you have to crush zombies.
However, I'll leave a positive review, if only because this game is practically free on sale with the collection, and there are plenty of negative reviews without me.

SK: Tak sa pozrime. Tato hra mi pribudla do knižnice zakúpením FlatOut Anthology Packu. Ako vždy keď mám niečo z packu, prečítam si recenzie a potom dám šancu, nech sú recenzie akokoľvek negatívne. Rovnako to bolo s Flatoutom 3. Nebudem klamať, po čítaní recenzií sa u mňa počítalo so zapnutím, odskúšaním všetkých módov a odinštalovaním. Lenže stal sa opak. Mne sa vám ten FO3 veľmo ľúby...  A myslím to úprimne. Iste, grafiky sú dosť ""dated"" (aj keď to je to posledné čo mňa u hier zaujíma), a jazdný model nieje realizmus (čo úprimne nie je na škodu), a jo, chýba soundtrack, ale je to perfektná arkádovka na vyblbnutie sa. Ovládanie nieje zlé. Pravdepodobne tí čo to tvrdia myslia jeden problémik - ak máte nitro altom, napr ľavým, auto bude s nitrom driftovať doľava. s pravím altom ako to je neviem, ale jednoducho si to rebindnite na X ako ja (mám tak nitro na všetkích flatoutoch), a ide to. 
Plusy / Mínusy
- Absencia soundtracku
- nezmeniteľná drift funkcia na Alt tlačítka
- na niektorých tratiach je treba si pamätať kam ísť pre ostré zákruty
+ Asi všetko ostatné. Skrátene sa jedná o zábavný arkádový chaos na vyblbnutie sa

As always when i have something from pack, i read reviews of others and then give game a chance, be reviews anyhow negative. It was same with Flatout 3. Aint gonna lie, after reading reviews i thought imma just turn it on, try out all modes and uninstall. But opposite happened. Ladies and gentleman, i actually love Flatout 3...  And im honest. Sure, grafics are pretty ""dated"" (tho it always were last concern on games for me), and driving model is not realistic (which honestly isnt bad thing), and yes, theres no soundtrack, but its awesome arcade thing for goofing around with cars. Controlls arent bad. Those who say that probably mean one lil problem - if u use ALT for nitro, for example left, car will both use nitro and will drift to left. dunno if its same with r.alt, but just rebind nitro for X as i do have it (have it like this on all flatouts), and all is good. 
Pros / Cons

O game apesar de não ser nem metade dos outros, dá para jogar. Não é isso tudo de ruim como dizem.
É enjoativo, você rapidamente perde o gosto de jogar. Não é tão difícil. Muitas pistas não são boas.
Tem vários modos de jogo. Os quais a maioria não curto muito, mas isso também se aplica aos demais da série. Gosto de correr e vê a bagaceira.
Os carros não são de direção ""dura"" como disseram, tem alguns que, na verdade, são muito ""moles"", faz curva fácil até demais. Provavelmente, o cidadão tunou o carro com opção speed e não se tocou que é normal ficar mais firme, ""dura"" a direção.
Realmente tem alguns bugs (cor do carro, checkpoint etc).
Ah! Não sobe ladeiras em 1ª marcha... 

Dica:
Jogue com o carro Scimitar do Sports Class, tuning: default que é sucesso na maioria das vezes e para variar o Nibarreth GT X3 do Tuner Class, tuning: speed (este carro tem a direção mui ""mole"" (""fácil demais""), ao colocar com tuning speed equilibra e assim fica quase apelão.

Em suma: só compre em promoção quando estiver próximo de R$1,99 e sem ter o que fazer com essa quantia. Afinal, esse game não é tão divertido.

Boa jogatina (nem sei).
Fique com DEUS.","I disagree with some of the comments.
The game, while not even half as good as the others, is playable. It's not as bad as they say.
It's boring; you quickly lose the enjoyment of playing. It's not that difficult. Many of the tracks aren't good.
There are several game modes. Most of them I don't really enjoy, but that also applies to the other games in the series. I like racing and watching the mess.
The cars aren't ""stiff"" to handle, as some say; in fact, some are too ""soft,"" taking corners too easily. The guy probably tuned the car with the speed option and didn't realize that it's normal for the steering to be firmer and ""stiff.""
There are indeed some bugs (car color, checkpoints, etc.).
Oh! It doesn't go up hills in 1st gear...

Tip:
Play with the Scimitar from Sports Class, tuning: default, which is a hit most of the time, and for a change, the Nibarreth GT X3 from Tuner Class, tuning: speed (this car has very ""soft"" steering (""too easy""), but when you put it in the speed tuning, it balances out and becomes almost overpowered).

In short: only buy it on sale when it's close to R$1.99 and you don't know what to do with that amount. After all, this game isn't that fun.

Have a good game (I don't even know).
God bless you."

だからって長く遊べるとは思えないし、勧めることはしません。ただ、ゲームに限らず、酷評されたものには触れてみるのが趣味という訓練を積んだ人には、触れてみる価値があるかもしれません。","I decided to give it a try, given the overwhelmingly negative reviews. It feels like a very simple, old-fashioned game. Fans of the series apparently disliked it, but I hadn't played a racing game since F-Zero, so I figured it was about what you'd expect. Furthermore, I'm not familiar with how cars behave in real life, so I couldn't find anything to criticize about the game's behavior. There don't seem to be any serious bugs that would make it difficult to continue playing, and there are a decent number of game modes available.

But that doesn't mean I expect to play it for long, so I wouldn't recommend it. However, for those who have made it a point to try out games and other things that are panned, it might be worth a try."

Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

  
You did come back different.

  
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

  
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

  
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

  
Everybody knows,

Heads up! Here we go.

  
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

  
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.

  
Welcome to Honex,

and a part of the Hexagon Group.

  
This is it!

  
Wow.

  
Wow.

  
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

  
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

  
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

  
Our top-secret formula

  
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

  
into this soothing sweet syrup

golden glow you know as...

  
Honey!

  
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!

  
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

  
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

  
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

  
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

  
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

  
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

  
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey

  
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

  
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?

  
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

  
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

  
But choose carefully

  
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.

  
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

  
What's the difference?

  
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

  
in 27 million years.

  
So you'll just work us to death?

  
We'll sure try.

  
Wow! That blew my mind!

  
""What's the difference?""
How can you say that?

  
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

  
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

  
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

  
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.

  
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

  
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?

  
Like what? Give me one example.

  
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

  
Please clear the gate.

Wait a second. Oheck it out.

  
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

  
I've never seen them this close.

  
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

  
Yeah, but some don't come back.

  
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

  
You guys did great!

  
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

  
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.

  
Their day's not planned.

  
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

  
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.

  
Right.

  
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

  
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.

  
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

  
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?

  
Distant. Distant.

  
Look at these two.

  
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.

  
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.

  
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!

  
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!

  
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.

  
What were you doing during this?

  
Trying to alert the authorities.

  
I can autograph that.

  
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?

  
Yeah. Gusty.

  
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.

  
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!

  
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.

  
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!

  
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

  
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?

  
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

  
Hey, Honex!

  
Dad, you surprised me.

  
You decide what you're interested in?

  
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.

  
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?

  
Son, let me tell you about stirring.

  
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.

  
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.

  
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,

  
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.

  
You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?

  
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.

  
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!

  
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.

  
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

  
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!

  
Wait till you see the sticks I have.

  
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

  
Let's open some honey and celebrate!

  
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.

  
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!

  
I'm so proud.

  
- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.

  
Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.

  
Yeah, right.

  
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...

  
- Is it still available?
- Hang on. Two left!

  
One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.

  
- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!

  
Wow!

  
Oouple of newbies?

  
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!

  
Make your choice.

  
- You want to go first?
- No, you go.

  
Oh, my. What's available?

  
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.

  
- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.

  
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

  
Wax monkey's always open.

  
The Krelman opened up again.

FlatOut se caracteriza por ser un juego de carreras donde la destrucción del ambiente y de los coches destaca bastante, pues ahora la destrucción del coche es mínima, la cámara se bugea cuando alcanzas altas velocidades, la IA es nefasta tomando solo dos opciones, chocar contra el primer árbol o pared invisible que ven o simplemente conducción perfecta.

FlatOut 1 fue un buen arranque ya que nos introduce el tema de la destrucción de entorno (muy mínima) y destrucción vehicular.

FlatOut 2 mejora aun más la destrucción, las físicas e colisión de objetos.

FlatOut Ultimate Carnage fue la saga en su máximo esplendor, una mejor gráfica muy notoria tanto iluminasion, detalle de texturas, etc.

Esta ultima entrega es un paso atrás, si, añade mas modos de juego y personajes jugables pero aun asi no podemos ocultar el hecho de que perdio toda su esencia y carisma, la saga FlatOut murio gracias a su 4 entrega.","Definitely the worst in the series.

FlatOut 2 further improves the destruction, physics, and object collisions.

FlatOut Ultimate Carnage was the series at its peak, with much improved graphics, lighting, texture detail, and more.

This latest installment is a step backwards, yes, adding more game modes and playable characters, but we still can't hide the fact that it lost all its essence and charisma. The FlatOut saga died thanks to its fourth installment."

КРУТАЯ ЗАДУМКА. ИНТЕРЕСНЫЙ СЕТТИНГ. ПОДОГРЕТЫЙ ИНТЕРЕС ФАНАТОВ.

В процессе разработки игры издатель вкидывал обещания того, что же мы увидим в новой части FlatOut. К слову хотелось бы сказать, что всё что они обещали и задумывали - воплотилось в жизнь! Итак, в чём же задумка игры. Сеттинг игры – это апокалипсисы (кто бы сомневался). Почему во множественном числе? Так, а потому что все сценарии воплощены в этой игре: тут и наводнение – по мере прохождения трассы – она тонет; тут и землетрясение – по мере прохождения трассы земля трескается и появляются расщелины на дороге, в которые проваливаются машины; тут и метеоритный дождь – на участках трассы с неба падают горящие метеориты; тут и мировой кризис – война – вовремя гонки летают вертолёты и ездят танки расстреливая трассу и гонщиков; тут и зомби апокалипсис, который вообще выделен в отдельный режим – нужно набирать очки сбивая зомби и умножать очки делая комбо (вы видели комбо 300X?!). Каждый апокалипсис проходит в своей стране, тем самым во время прохождения мы путешествуем по миру. Т.е. первая глава – это Америка, Детройт и там промышленный кризис повсюду уничтоженная природа, руины городов и процветающие заводы, которые заполняют воздух едким химическим дымом; вторая глава – это Италия, Рим и там метеоритный дождь в городе, повсюду разруха и пожары; и так далее по регионам. И это только основная компания + зомби режим! В игре, в принципе, большое количество режимов – веселись сколько влезет (господи, за что). Помимо выше упомянутых имеются: каскадёрские трюки, прямиком из первых частей только с большим количеством локаций (последняя часть трюков проходит на локации АД – это не шутка нax*й!); бои на арене – битва на тачках одного класса; большая битва – все классы, все машины; испытания на бигфутах; скоростные заезды на болидах формулы один, в большой вариации трасс (как вам трасса «Казахстанская Резня» или «Озеро Свитязь» страшно? НЕТ?! А уже пора бояться!); ночная компания (Вам когда-нибудь попадала соринка в глаз? Так вот представьте, что у вас в глазах горсть соли и её можно включать и выключать, когда вам захочется); бездорожье; испытание (по факту случайная гонка из случайного режима).
И действительно, гонки в сеттинге апокалипсисов с геймплеем разрушающихся трасс – интересная задумка, но «Подходит ли это серии FlatOut?» большой вопрос. Итак, «море» контента (дерьма) нам пообещали, а что же с остальной частью игры? Далее дела обстояли так: новый движок (скорее недоработанный кусок кода, но допустим), новая физика (Ньютон в гробу 2000 оборотов как пропеллер вертится после такой «физики»), выбор из большого количества персонажей (последующий хлеще предыдущего), выход на консоли и ПК, динамичный саундтрек (вот именно бл*ть, саундтреК, один трек на всю игру), онлайн режим (как же он хорош, там такой великолепный ноль игроков), и самое главное – номерное продолжение легендарной серии (отныне это самое худшее продолжение в истории). Все были в нетерпении, все ждали новую игру.

ПЕРВЫЕ «ЗВОНОЧКИ» ИЛИ ПРОВАЛ ЕЩЁ НЕ ВЫШЕДШЕЙ ИГРЫ

Как уже говорилось, издатель охотно сливал информацию о триквеле – и вот за месяц до выхода игры издатель выпускает тизер и там красуется легендарный логотип разработчиков гонок, и это…. …Team6? Кто это бл*ть вообще?! Покапавшись в интернете фанаты узнают, что предыдущий издатель FlatOut - Empire Interactive стал банкротом и права на само имя «FlatOut» ушло третьим лицам, а именно Strategy First (После того как они выпустили FlatOut 3, будем называть их Стратегия Фистинга). Так вот Стратегия Фист поручило разработку продолжения свежеполученной франшизы одной из своих компаний разработчиков – Team6. А теперь самый сок! На момент выхода FlatOut 3 у горе разработчиков было 44 разработанных проекта! И ни один, я подчёркиваю НИ ОДИН из них не был оценён более чем на 3 балла из 10! То есть это разработчики треша третьей волны! 

ИТОГ ИЛИ КАЗНЬ ЦЕЛОЙ ФРАНШИЗЫ ОДНОЙ ИГРОЙ

И как говорилось, студия которая одной игрой могла бы вывести себя из тени, конечно же… oбoсрaлacь, не сняв штаны! Вы что думали они смогут?! Реальный мир – это не Диснеевский мюзикл! Что же всё-таки с игрой?! А давайте по порядку:
Цветокор. Помните Жёлтый фильтр в FlatOut 2 или NFS Most Wanted? Так вот тут тоже есть такой, только если в перечисленных играх он был ламповым и приятным, то тут создаётся ощущение, будто вам нa*caли прямо в глаза! Боль тоже думаю сопоставимая!
Геймплей. Он ужасен, машины делятся на много классов и подклассов…. ЛОЖ! Они делятся на отвратительно управляемые утюги и не управляемые утюги! На вторых ездить вообще невозможно, на первых просто отвратительно: машина тормозит и ускоряется, когда ей захочется, абсолютно случайная управляемость, когда вы входите в поворот, машина сама решает поворачивать или нет!
Нитро. Ох сyка, это отдельная песня наx*й! При активации нитро машина восстанавливает повреждения, и моделька автомобиля вытягивается в длину превращаясь в болт, который разработчики ложили на эту игру!
Контент? Где? Все карты и локации просто ужасны, большая часть из них просто не работает, а оставшаяся поносит ужасным гейм дизайном! Реально, после проезда трассы вы не захотите на неё возвращаться! А некоторые захотите вырубить прямо после старта! В зомби режиме после переезда зомби появляется эффект брызг крови и тут уже становится не понятно, это ещё эффекты такие или у вас уже развивается катаракта?! Продолжительность всей игры: 10-12 часов! Это почти все достижения и весь геймплей! Почему «почти», да потому что все достижения в принципе невозможно получить! Например, достижения по онлайну! Он мёртв, как и моя душа после прохождения этой игры! Или достижение о завершении последнего режима игры – испытаний! Там 19ое испытание невозможно пройти априори, тебе дают автобус, на котором невозможно проехать всю трассу! Он просто застрянет и всё.
Остатки роскоши. Во всей игре звучит один ужасный трек, без слов, просто музыка! Зачем вы славите дьявола?! Это его музыка! Это она звучит в аду! Это под эту музыку истязают грешников!! И самое ужасное: здесь есть режим с вылетающим через лобовое водителем, которым нужно делать различные трюки как в предыдущих частях… казалось бы куда ниже можно упасть, а вот куда! Это просто убожество! Теперь все трюки свелись к тому, что нужно попасть в цель водилой! И всё! Без очков, без рекордов! Попадаешь - идёшь дальше, не попадаешь – задр*тишь один и тот же трюк!
И ах да, чуть не забыл, оптимизация… её здесь нет! Просто примите это!
Вывод: страшно, очень страшно, мы не знаем, что это такое, еслиб мы знали, что это такое, но мы не знаем, что это такое! И вот это вот посмело в названии поставить имя FlatOut!! Я даже не знаю, как это оценить! С одной стороны, Это конец! А с другой безумное безудержное веселье! У меня как-то водителя намотало на колесо машины, и я так 5 кругов отъездил! Или гонка под картой в пустоте бытия! Где ещё такое увидишь?! Или в Аду провалиться под текстуры. В общем игра для любителей треша или БДСМ. 
Я поставлю ей оценку в 2из10 и вы уж сами решайте к какому сообществу я отношусь!

P.S. Коротко о цене. «О ЧЁМ?» спросите меня вы. Так вот об этом самом, она ещё и денег стоит – целых 250 рублей! Она стоит дороже чем легендарный FlatOut 2! Я считаю, что такое даже бесплатно стыдно раздавать, а необходимым считаю за игру ещё и доплачивать!
","Once a hit with its debut and cemented with a legendary sequel, the series has only received a remake in the form of FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage in the five years since FlatOut 2's release. The entire gaming community was waiting for a proper third installment in the series... ""No problem,"" thought players. ""The third installment won't disappoint!"" ...
""FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage is still good, but it's only recommended for those who haven't seen the original FlatOut 2. Everyone else is better off waiting for the full-fledged third installment."" ©Igromania

Did you finally get it! Have you ever had boiling tin poured on your face?! NO?! You just haven't played FlatOut 3!

COOL IDEA. INTERESTING SETTING. WETTED FANS' INTEREST.

During the game's development, the publisher kept promising what we'd see in the new FlatOut. By the way, I'd like to say that everything they promised and planned has come to fruition! So, what's the game's concept? The game's setting is apocalypse (who would have doubted it). Why plural? Yeah, because all the scenarios are embodied in this game: there's a flood - as you progress along the track, it sinks; there's an earthquake - as you progress along the track, the ground cracks and crevices appear in the road, into which cars fall; there's a meteor shower - flaming meteorites fall from the sky on sections of the track; there's a global crisis - war - during the race, helicopters fly and tanks drive by, shooting at the track and the racers; there's a zombie apocalypse, which is even highlighted as a separate mode - you need to score points by shooting down zombies and multiply them by doing combos (have you seen the 300X combo?!). Each apocalypse takes place in its own country, so during the game we travel around the world. That is, the first chapter is America, Detroit, and there is an industrial crisis everywhere, destroyed nature, ruins of cities and thriving factories that fill the air with acrid chemical smoke; the second chapter is Italy, Rome, and there is a meteor shower in the city, devastation and fires everywhere; and so on by region. And this is only the main campaign + zombie mode! The game, in principle, has a large number of modes - have fun as much as you want (God, for what). In addition to the above-mentioned, there are: stunt tricks, straight from the first parts, only with a larger number of locations (the last part of the stunts takes place on the HELL location - this is not a fucking joke!); arena fights - a battle on cars of the same class; a big battle - all classes, all cars; Bigfoot challenges; High-speed Formula One races on a wide variety of tracks (how scary are the ""Kazakhstan Massacre"" or ""Lake Svityaz"" tracks? NO?! It's time to be scared!); nightlife (Have you ever had a speck of dust in your eye? Well, imagine having a handful of salt in your eye that you can turn on and off whenever you want); off-roading; a challenge (essentially a random race from a random mode).
Indeed, racing in an apocalypse setting with gameplay featuring crumbling tracks is an interesting idea, but ""Does it fit the FlatOut series?"" is a big question. So, we've been promised a sea of ​​content (crap), but what about the rest of the game? Then things went like this: a new engine (more like an unfinished piece of code, but let's say so), new physics (Newton in his coffin would spin like a propeller at 2000 RPM after that kind of ""physics""), a wide selection of characters (the next one is even worse than the last), a console and PC release, a dynamic soundtrack (that's right, a fucking soundtrack, one track for the entire game), an online mode (it's so good, it has such a magnificent zero-player mode), and most importantly, a numbered sequel to the legendary series (from now on, it's the worst sequel in history). Everyone was impatient, everyone was waiting for the new game.

FIRST ""WAR WARNINGS"" OR THE FAILURE OF A GAME NOT YET RELEASED

As already mentioned, the publisher eagerly leaked information about the threequel – and then, a month before the game's release, the publisher releases a teaser featuring the legendary logo of the racing game developers, and this... ...Team6? Who the f*ck is this?! After digging around online, fans discovered that FlatOut's previous publisher, Empire Interactive, went bankrupt, and the rights to the ""FlatOut"" name were sold to a third party, namely Strategy First (after they released FlatOut 3, we'll call them Strategy Fisting). So, Strategy First commissioned the development of the sequel to their newly acquired franchise to one of their development companies, Team6. And now the best part! At the time of FlatOut 3's release, these unfortunate developers had 44 projects in development! And not one, I emphasize NOT ONE, of them was rated higher than 3 out of 10! So, these are developers of third-wave trash!

RESULT OR EXECUTION OF AN ENTIRE FRANCHISE WITH ONE GAME

And as they said, a studio that could have brought itself out of the shadows with one game, of course... shit its pants! What did you think they could do?! The real world isn't a Disney musical! What's wrong with the game?! Let's take it one step at a time:
Color Corrector. Remember the Yellow Filter in FlatOut 2 or NFS Most Wanted? Well, it's there too, only while in those games it was cool and pleasant, here it feels like someone pissed right in your eyes! I think the pain is comparable!
Gameplay. It's terrible, the cars are divided into many classes and subclasses... A LIE! They're divided into horribly controllable irons and uncontrollable irons! The latter are completely impossible to drive, the former are simply awful: the car brakes and accelerates whenever it wants, completely random handling, when you enter a turn, the car decides on its own whether to turn or not!
Nitro. Oh, shit, that's a whole other story! When nitro is activated, the car repairs damage, and the car model stretches out, turning into the bolt the developers put into this game!
Content? Where? All the maps and locations are simply terrible, most of them simply don't work, and the rest are afflicted with terrible game design! Seriously, after driving through a track, you won't want to return! And some you'll want to knock out right after the start! In zombie mode, after running over a zombie, a blood splatter effect appears, and at this point, you can't tell if it's just the effects or if you're already developing cataracts?! The entire game lasts 10-12 hours! That's almost all the achievements and all the gameplay! Why ""almost""? Because all the achievements are basically impossible to obtain! For example, the online achievements! He's dead, just like my soul after completing this game! Or the achievement for completing the game's final mode—challenges! There, the 19th challenge is impossible to complete a priori; you're given a bus that's impossible to drive the entire track on! It just gets stuck and that's it.
Remnants of luxury. The entire game plays one terrible track, no lyrics, just music! Why are you praising the devil?! This is his music! This is what they play in hell! This is the music to which sinners are tortured!! And the worst thing: there's a mode where the driver flies out through the windshield, requiring him to perform various tricks like in the previous games... you'd think there'd be much lower to fall, but nowhere near! This is simply pathetic! Now all the tricks have been reduced to hitting the target with the driver! And that's it! No points, no records! If you hit the target, you move on; if you miss, you'll just keep trying the same trick!
And oh yeah, I almost forgot, optimization... it's not here! Just accept it!
Conclusion: it's scary, really scary, we don't know what this is, if only we knew what it is, but we don't know what it is! And they dared to put the name FlatOut in the title!! I don't even know how to rate this! On the one hand, it's the end! On the other hand, it's pure, unbridled fun! I once got a driver wrapped around a car wheel, and I drove around like that for five laps! Or a race under the map in the void of existence! Where else can you see that?! Or falling through the textures in Hell. Overall, this game is for fans of trash or BDSM.

I'll give it a 2 out of 10, and you can decide for yourself which community I belong to!

P.S. A quick word about the price. ""About WHAT?"" you ask. Well, it costs money – a whopping 250 rubles! It costs more than the legendary FlatOut 2! I think it's shameful to even give something like this away for free, and I consider it necessary to pay extra for the game!

I played one race. It will not be my only one, as it will be fun to come back every couple of months and see just how bad this game is, because it will perhaps be fun to watch this dysfunctional garbage heap limp through basic mechanics.

This game, somehow, someway, stuck to Flatout principle of being a silly pre-Wreckfest combat racer. But it dialed up the somewhat lacking features of the original all the way to 9 and it really shows.

I've played all the modes several times. Honestly, I wasn't hooked.
The graphics are comparable to the second game. They did a good job with the color correction. It still feels like you're playing Burnout Paradise, not FlatOut.
The demolition derby is terrible, as are the physics. The collisions are paper-thin. I won't even mention the vehicle controls.

The camera follows you like it was stuck between TPP and from the inside, you can't see the road before you, controls are clunky, cars have random physics during same race, just slip on the track or are hard to get them off of it. There's different collision mechanics, so the same objects that were destructible before, now are solid and completely ruin your progress on the race if you even lick them.

Both graphics and effects look like they were the first game in the series, not the third. It takes such a dive with quality it saddens me after binging previous two games. The UI is so disgusting and unreadable you can't even follow your progress in race, as the markers on the minimap are all the same colors and there's a ton of different words all around the screen, taking your attention off the road. You don't know which bar is nitro and which is your car's health. Everything suddenly needs to be told in a sentence instead of, for example, health bars, damage ratings, or just stupid road signs to show you where to turn next (there's a counter of how many meters/feet are to the next checkpoint, just to name one).

There's also no personality to this game. Previous ones had some characters coming back in every race, you knew their names, you knew their cars, their strenghts and weak points. It built some tension and made you more competetive, you knew who to watch out for if you were few points away from each other to win the cup. There's none of that. You don't know anyone's name until the race finishes and the list with places show up. You don't even know who is who, as all cars look so similar and bland. And, as I've previously stated, they all look like it was from a mobile game.

You can't visibly damage opponents' cars, as even the text that appears usually says ""You've dealt 1% damage"" while one collision with a rock on the track sends you to space. You get more damage done to yourself by rubbing against obstacles than by hitting others - while if anyone hits you, you're already dead, kid.

Please don't waste your money on this trash, even if its $2. It would be worth more if you just took $2 bill and threw it into thrash, because maybe some rat or racoon will eat it or some crow or pidgeon will make a nest out of it.

Хотя ее сложно отнести к этой серии, ибо от флэтаута в этой куче говна игре, разве что название. Не очень понятно по какой причине, по какому стечению обстоятельств разработку третьей части (и вообще права на всю серию) отдали другому издателю и разработчику. Такое ощущение что Team6 даже не пытались сделать что то хотя бы просто нормальное и играбельное. Они просто видимо решили сразу делать треш, пародию или еще что-то по мотивам FlatOut.

В подгорании и разрывании Хаосе и Разрушении отвратительно сделано буквально ВСЁ. Можно начать с любого аспекта игры, ибо хоть какой-то ценности ничто не представляет.

Графика - она убога, Team6 явно не поскупились на повсеместный блюр. Модели машин, окружение, даже интерфейс - прямиком из годов так 2000-х.

Физика у машин не идет ни в какое сравнение с физикой из FlatOut 2 (по моему мнению самой лучшей части серии). Машины здесь ведут себя как куски мыла которые сложно поймать в ванне с водой.

Геймплей хоть и отличается разнообразием режимов, но эти режимы настолько плохо организованы и настолько устарели что опять же ценности не представляют никакой.

ИИ соперников вообще отсутствует как класс.

По саундтреку могу сказать что он был бы неплох в какой нибудь пародийной аркадке родом из 2000-х.

Также довольно спорный момент - это персонажи. Это просто апофеоз вообще всего маразма которым видимо страдают разработчики.

В итоге получаем одну из самых наихудших игр развлекательной индустрии, которую мне было бы стыдно выпустить в свет, в стиме, да еще и по цене в 250 рублей.

Оценка 10 из 10 кусков хозяйственного мыла.","A game that should never have been created. A game that disgraces the entire FlatOut series. Although it's hard to classify it as part of that series, as the only thing that's FlatOut-esque in this pile of crap is the name. It's unclear why, or by what coincidence, the development of the third game (and the rights to the entire series) was handed over to another publisher and developer. It feels like Team6 didn't even try to make something decent and playable. They apparently just decided to go straight for trash, a parody, or something else inspired by FlatOut.

In the burning and tearing chaos and destruction, literally EVERYTHING is horribly done. You could start with any aspect of the game, as nothing offers any real value.

The graphics are pathetic; Team6 clearly didn't skimp on the ubiquitous blur. The car models, the environments, even the interface – they're straight out of the 2000s.

The car physics don't compare to those in FlatOut 2 (in my opinion, the best game in the series). The cars behave like bars of soap, hard to catch in a bathtub.

The gameplay, while varied, offers so many modes, but they're so poorly organized and outdated that they're essentially worthless.

The opponent AI is completely nonexistent.

Judging by the soundtrack, I can tell it would be at home in some parody arcade game from the 2000s.

The characters are also a rather controversial issue. They're simply the pinnacle of the insanity that the developers seem to be suffering from.

The end result is one of the worst games in the entertainment industry, one I'd be ashamed to release on Steam, especially at a price of 250 rubles.

Единственное что мне действительно понравилось это Дерби... уничтожать противника тачкой, раньше была игра Кармагедон где принцып был тот же, это и воплотили в ФлэтАут ... как уже сказал, единственный и огромной плюс это таранить соперника до полного уничтожения. Другой прелести в игре нет, гонки как и везде.
","FlatOut 3: Chaos & Destruction – like all the FlatOut games before it… it's a racing game, a death race, you might say. Unfortunately, it's clearly inferior to its competitor, NFS, but what can you do? Terrible controls and unattractive cars are to blame, but the aggressive driving and the ability to destroy everything in your path are almost always adjustable. The only thing I really liked was the Derby… destroying your opponent with your car. There used to be a game called Carmageddon, which had the same principle, and they implemented it in FlatOut… as I already said, the only huge advantage is ramming your opponent until they completely destroy him. There's no other appeal to the game; it's racing like anywhere else."

Flat Out 3 um jogo com bastante conteúdo porém quase nenhuma qualidade.

[b]IA: 0/10[/b]
A IA do jogo é terrível, péssima em todos os sentidos, completamente estúpida em todos os modos. Mesmo colocando no difícil consegui vencer diversas partidas simplesmente porque meu oponente não conseguia fazer uma única curva sem destruir o próprio carro. No modo derby eles se amontoam em um ponto só e se destroem ali.

[b]Mecânica: 1/10[/b]
A mecânica de direção é mais ou menos, cada carro é bem diferente e após algum tempo jogando você consegue controlar o carro pela pista, mas acaba se tornando mais trabalhoso do que divertido e você acaba se entediando com o jogo.
E temos diversos modos de jogo:
[list]
[*][b]Race:[/b] [i]A clássica corrida, nada de novo e nem diferente.[/i]
[*][b]Stunt:[/b] [i]Bem “ok”, se compararmos com FlatOut 2 deixa muito a desejar com pouca variedade de estilos e os únicos estilos que tem são bem entediantes.[/i]
[*][b]Battle e Big Battle:[/b] [i]O modo derby, extremamente ruim por 2 motivos, a IA que vai se amontoar em um canto, e a forma de pontuação na qual você não precisar fazer nada, os oponentes vão te atacar e você vai pontuar antes de ser destruído e ganhando a partida mesmo sendo o primeiro a ser destruído.[/i]
[*][b]Nightshift:[/b] [i]A clássica corrida porém a noite com um nevoeiro que não te deixa enxergar o que está a frente e poucos oponentes, de 1 a 4.[/i]
[*][b]Offroad:[/b] [i]Um modo que tem apenas duas pistas e o objetivo é fazer a maior pontuação possível, destruindo objetos ou oponentes, saltos longos e drift, nada de especial e bem entediante, basta destruir todas as cercas em um mapa e no outro ficar passando pelos morros para saltar.[/i]
[*][b]Speed:[/b] [i]Um modo no estilo de formula 1 aonde os carros são mais rápidos e mais fáceis de controlar fazendo com que não tenha desafio nenhum jogar esse modo.[/i]
[*][b]Moster Truck:[/b] [i]Até agora não entendi esse modo, ganhei todas simplesmente destruindo meu carro na primeira oportunidade e por todos estarem com 0 de pontuação eu ficava entre os 3 primeiros e ganhava a corrida.[/i]
[*][b]Challenge:[/b] [i]São 50 desafios que envolvem quase todos os modos de jogo, porém você não pode escolher o veículo ou as regras da corrida.[/i]
[*][b]Splatt Out:[/b] [i]Um modo aonde o único objetivo é alcançar a pontuação definida ao atropelar zumbis, que não te atacam e nem fazem nada ficam somente parados pela pista, bem entediante.[/i]
[/list]
[b]Áudio e Trilha Sonora: 0/10/[/b]
Os sons não são balanceados, são bem irritantes e a trilha sonora é uma das piores

[b]Design: 2/10[/b]
Enquanto o design de alguma das pistas é decente,a maior parte sem nexo e repetitiva, sem contar que tem diversos bugs como em algumas pistas em que passei por cima de um objeto e meu carro foi lançado no espaço.

[h1]Considerações Finais[/h1]
Apesar do jogo ter bastante conteúdo não significa que estão completos, sinto que falta algo no jogo. A IA é completamente inútil e acaba se tornando chato jogar pois não há dificuldade no jogo. Outro ponto ruim é que a maioria dos carros são ruins de controlar o que acaba fazendo com que você escolha 1 carro e o use durante o jogo todo, não tem um progresso é como um jogo de corrida rápida aonde você pode escolher 1 carro qualquer e correr na pista que você quiser no modo de jogo que quiser, além de que você se quer precisa jogar direito para ganhar, nos modos que pedem pontuação para ganhar basta fazer um pouco de pontuação e destruir o seu para ganhar pois assim que você destrói o seu carro o que conta são as pontuações daquele momento, ganhei todas as corridas de Monster Truck em menos de 10 segundo apenas destruindo meu carro e vencendo com a pontuação zero. O jogo não tem um objetivo claro e não pede nenhum empenho.

É simplesmente um jogo terrível em quase todos os sentidos e não vale o preço, sinceramente não acho que vale nem em promoção.

Preço Atual [b][u]R$ 19,99[/u][/b]
Preço Recomendado [b][u]R$ 2,49[/u][/b]

[b]Nota Final: [u]0,7/10[/u][/b]","[h1][b]Flatout 3: Chaos & Destruction[/b][/h1]

Flat Out 3 is a game with a lot of content but almost no quality.

[b]AI: 0/10[/b]
The game's AI is terrible, terrible in every way, completely stupid in every mode. Even on hard, I managed to win several matches simply because my opponent couldn't make a single turn without destroying their own car. In derby mode, they pile up in one spot and destroy each other there.

[b]Mechanics: 1/10[/b]
The driving mechanics are so-so; each car is very different, and after a while, you get to control the car around the track, but it ends up becoming more work than fun, and you end up getting bored with the game. And we have several game modes:
[list]
[*][b]Race:[/b] [i]The classic race, nothing new or different.[/i]
[*][b]Stunt:[/b] [i]Pretty ""okay,"" if compared to FlatOut 2, it leaves a lot to be desired with little variety in styles, and the only styles it has are quite boring.[/i]
[*][b]Battle and Big Battle:[/b] [i]Derby mode, extremely bad for two reasons: the AI ​​​​that will crowd into a corner, and the scoring system in which you don't have to do anything; opponents will attack you and you will score points before being destroyed, winning the match even if you are the first to be destroyed.[/i]
[*][b]Nightshift:[/b] [i]The classic race, but at night with fog that doesn't let you see what's ahead and few opponents, from 1 to 4.[/i]
[*][b]Offroad:[/b] [i]A mode with only two tracks, and the objective is to get the highest score possible by destroying objects or opponents, long jumps, and drifting. Nothing special and quite boring. Just destroy all the fences on one map and then drive over hills to jump on the other.[/i]
[*][b]Speed:[/b] [i]A Formula 1-style mode where the cars are faster and easier to control, making this mode completely unchallenging.[/i]
[*][b]Monster Truck:[/b] [i]I still don't understand this mode. I won them all by simply destroying my car at the first opportunity, and since everyone had 0 points, I was in the top 3 and won the race.[/i]
[*][b]Challenge:[/b] [i]There are 50 challenges that involve almost all game modes, but you can't choose the vehicle. or the rules of the race.[/i]
[*][b]Splatt Out:[/b] [i]A mode where the only objective is to reach a set score by running over zombies, which don't attack you or do anything; they just stand still on the track, quite boring.[/i]
[/list]
[b]Audio and Soundtrack: 0/10/[/b]
The sounds are unbalanced, quite annoying, and the soundtrack is one of the worst.

[b]Design: 2/10[/b]
While the design of some of the tracks is decent, most are disjointed and repetitive, not to mention having several bugs, like on some tracks where I ran over an object and my car was launched into space.

[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]
Although the game has a lot of content, it doesn't mean it's complete; I feel like something is missing. The AI ​​is completely useless and ends up being boring to play because there's no difficulty in the game. Another downside is that most of the cars are difficult to control, which means you have to choose one car and use it throughout the game. There's no progression, it's like a fast-paced racing game where you can choose any car and race on any track you want in any game mode. Besides, you don't even need to play well to win. In modes that require scoring, you just need to earn a few points and destroy your car to win. Once you destroy your car, the only thing that counts is the score at that moment. I won every Monster Truck race in under 10 seconds by simply destroying my car and winning with a zero score. The game has no clear objective and doesn't require any effort.

It's simply a terrible game in almost every way and isn't worth the price. I honestly don't think it's worth it even on sale.

Team 6 went with the motto ""quantity over quality"" and it shows. The game has plenty of content, but nothing, NOTHING is finished.

[b][u]The driving model[/u][/b] is surprisingly okay-ish, and depending on your car choice you might have a good time going through some of the tracks. I did encounter a bug where the car refused to steer to the right properly though, and instead went sliding and spinning out immediately, which was fixed after restarting the game.

[b][u]The maps[/u][/b] are a split issue. While it seems to be the only thing where they at least tried, they're absolutely unreadable and the stiffness of half the objects on the road makes no sense whatsoever. Some of the hills in the offroad tracks are overly large, and some cars (including the AI) will struggle going up on them, which ruins the whole feeling. The circuit tracks are pretty well made though (probably because of the layouts already existing, yes, I noticed that half-assed Hockenheimring Team6).

[b][u]The derbies[/u][/b] are boring and poorly made. Not only is the damage model overall absolutely garbage (which is pretty crucial for a demolition derby racing game if you ask me), but the way the game counts points is absolutely retarded, plus the AI also shines here (you will get ganged upon by 3-4 drivers, eventually get stuck on their roof and get 10k points for staying there as the games will consider that as dealing damage for whatever reason).

[b][u]The stunts[/u][/b] are surprisingly okay. While the camera is absolutely terribly made, the stunts now allow you much more control post launch than the previous franchise entries, and this allowed for some interesting concepts for stunts, on which Team6 capitalized successfully.

[b][u]The game[/u][/b] also struggles with not having any unified career/campaign unlike the previous FlatOut games, and it shows - you do unlock some cars and tracks as you progress through certain types of events, but overall it all feels only like one huge ""quick race"" (in racing games, this stands for simply playing a track with a car of your choice while not progressing anywhere, just to get a feel for it/beat a certain time/whatever you want to do there). I can't also overlook some of the bugs I encountered while playing (broken UI after alttabbing, Justin Case's texture being broken during stunts and the driving model one I mentioned).

...and last but not least, [b][u]the sounds[/u][/b] are all very questionable. You'll get your eardrums blown off every single time you start, as there will be good bunch of cars NOSing instantly, but other than that there's not much, no songs (besides the main menu music), nothing.

I'm almost certain that I missed some points, however I won't go into details with every single gamemode in the game, since as I said, there are plenty and none of them are finished properly, so it would be a bit pointless. However, let me say this - the game is better than the general public makes it out to be, if this came out seven years earlier, and was being given out for free in those magazine CDs, I bet I'd have nice childhood memories of it. It's by no means a good game, but it also did some stuff correctly, and has it's moments where you'll genuinely be having fun.

1. управление не очень, постоянно бывают моменты когда тебя заносит куда нибудь, и ты врезаешься.
2. клавиша R. в первых двух частях это была та кнопка, которая выручала. сейчас же она спавнит тебя не пойми где, и если ты был на первом месте, то тебя быстро обгонят, ведь ты еще 2 секунды после респавна не можешь двигаться, и через тебя спокойно летают машины.

1. The controls aren't great; there are always moments when you skid off somewhere and crash.
2. The R key. In the first two games, it was the key that saved me. Now, it spawns you in the middle of nowhere, and if you were in first place, you'll quickly be overtaken, because you can't move for two seconds after respawning, and cars can easily fly right over you.

It is no secret that the game is uglier than sin. The style is truly awful. Once I got past this though, I was surprised to see some level of competence went into this game. Having checked the settings, I saw custom key binds were a working feature, keyboard controls were given a level of respect I wouldn't have expected. 

Getting into a race, it's safe to say that it wasn't enjoyable. The first thing I noticed was the lack of music during gameplay so not off to a good start. Yet gameplay aside, in-game technical performance was actually fairly acceptable. I have encountered a couple of bugs during gameplay but nothing game breaking so far. I have also tried some of the alternative game modes such as destruction derby, the ragdoll launch, and Zombie knockdown. The first 2 were admittedly more interesting than the actual racing, dare I say... the destruction derby and ragdoll launch were actually somewhat ""fun"".

For some odd reason the game features selectable characters, they don't really serve any purpose other than how your ragdoll will look like. They're a odd mix of references or OC's, with one character clearly being based on Mario from Super Mario Bros, another on Vin Diesel, and then there's one based on film director Uwe Boll for some reason. It's a nigh useless feature, yet I feel it adds to the experience. The game's sense of humour has this alien charm to it.

I'm a bit conflicted here, as the 89 minutes I've played so far have been ""bad"" but also quite entertaining. I also received this game for free so I had nothing to lose, yet I feel that Flatout 3 stands as some sort of ""So Bad it's Good"" game. It entertained me beyond my initial expectations of none, and displayed features that some games considered good or rated ""Very Positive"" on Steam lack.

I think to combat this the Devs should team up with the epic games launcher to give free copies to new players and expand the playerbase. I cannot wait to see the
continuation of the story in the upcoming dlc and i can't recommened this game more. 87/100"

Si eres fan de la saga Flatout o tienes ganas de comprar un juego de coches, Tal vez deberías detenerte antes de tan siquiera pasar el cursor sobre el botón comprar, Si aun así decides arriesgarte ve con 0 expectativas del mismo ya que el juego aun sin ellas estoy seguro de que te decepcionara, Tienen muchísimos problemas sore todo visuales que a continuación enlistare.

PUNTOS MALOS
-Manejo horrible: Manejar en este juego es todo un sufrimiento.
-Gráficos feos: Quien me conozca sabe que me da casi igual los gráficos, pero este juego simplemente no puedo verlo bien, las texturas son horribles en la opciones ´´altas´´ y la selección de colores es un desastre a tal punto que aunque te den la opción de escoger colores de coches, casi siempre se verán cafés o amarillentos.
-Mapas: Demonios los mapas son algo para llorar, viniendo de anteriores Flatouts podrías pensar que es un apartado bueno, NO, no lo es… los mapas dan un sida tanto visual como jugable como no tienen una idea, hay mapas donde el diseño de los caminos esta muy desproporcionado a lo que son los coches, están muy vacíos y muchas veces los terrenos son muy raros y te puedes llegar a atorar fácilmente (me paso que en una carrera mi coche no podía subir una pendiente por no ir lo suficientemente rápido).
-Destrucción: lo más destacable de los Flatouts era el poder destruir coches enemigos y ver como estos golpes quedaban en ellos, pues tiremos todo eso por la borda y remplacémoslo con un sistema de choques con vida en % y daños superficiales, ah esto tal vez debería haberlo agregado en mapas, pero a veces cuando haces saltos en mapas esto le va quitando vida al coche incluso si son saltos obligatorios…
-Minijuegos: la mayoría de los minijuegos son malos, pero solo explicare uno, DERBY DE DESTRUCCION es incómodo de jugar (como todos los minijuegos) ya que te ponen un numero alocado de coches, gracias a esto el modo en ciertos mapas se vuelve en una orgia de varios coches dándose contra el mundo, además el minijuego literalmente no te premia con ser el último, mas bien con el puntaje obtenido en el mismo.

PUNTOS BUENOS
-Tiene?

CONCLUSION
Este juego es mas doloroso que ver a un huérfano pidiendo una pizza familiar.
","NOT RECOMMENDED (There are faster ways to go blind)
If you're a fan of the Flatout series or are eager to buy a car game, you might want to stop before even hovering over the buy button. If you still decide to take the risk, go in with zero expectations, as I'm sure the game will disappoint you even without them. It has a ton of visual issues, which I'll list below.

BAD POINTS
-Horrible handling: Driving in this game is a real pain.
-Ugly graphics: Anyone who knows me knows that I don't really care about graphics, but I simply can't see this game properly. The textures are horrible on the ""high"" settings, and the color selection is a disaster, to the point that even if you have the option to choose car colors, they'll almost always look brown or yellowish.
-Maps: Damn, the maps are something to cry about. Coming from previous Flatouts, you might think it's a good section, NO, it's not... the maps are visually and playably frustrating, like you have no idea. There are maps where the road design is very disproportionate to the cars. They're very empty, and many times the terrain is very strange and you can easily get stuck (it happened to me that in a race my car couldn't go up a slope because I wasn't going fast enough). -Destruction: The highlight of Flatouts was being able to destroy enemy cars and see how these hits affected them. Well, let's throw all that out the window and replace it with a crash system with % health and surface damage. Ah, maybe I should have added this to the maps, but sometimes when you do jumps on maps, it saps the car's life, even if they're mandatory jumps...
-Minigames: Most of the minigames are bad, but I'll only explain one. DESTRUCTION DERBY is awkward to play (like all minigames) since they put a crazy number of cars at you. Thanks to this, the mode on certain maps becomes an orgy of multiple cars crashing into each other. Plus, the minigame doesn't literally reward you with being last, but rather with the score obtained.

GOOD POINTS
-Does it have one?

CONCLUSION
This game is more painful than watching an orphan order a family pizza.

Když se maso osmahne, přidáme papriku, promícháme a necháme podusit na středně velkém žáru asi 3 minuty. Přidáme trochu oregána a asi 150 g kečupu. Promícháme a na mírnějším ohni dusíme za občasného podlévání asi 2-2,5 až 3 hodiny, dokud maso není skoro měkké.

Zhruba 1/2 hodiny předtím, přidáme 2 podél nakrájené kapie a za podlévání (je-li nutné) jej přivedeme k bodu, neboli bodíku, kdy přidáme soli tolik, kolik je potřeba.

5 minut před koncem přidáme prolisovaný česnek, dost majoránky a dle potřeby rozkvedlanou mouku. Nakonec přidáme 0,2-0,3 dl dobrého českého piva a už nevaříme, jinak se pivo vytratí.

Necháme uležet 2-3 dny. Takto zrozený guláš má výjmečné chuťové vlastnosti, že vám již jiný guláš ani chutnat nebude!

Podáváme s dobrým knedlíkem, kolečky cibule, pivem a pro labužníky doporučuji, lžíci/lžičku kysané smetany navrch.
","In a large pot - possibly a cistern, heat the lard and add the chopped onion (we will almost burn the onion with occasional stirring), this is the only way to make the right base for the goulash! Then add chili, pepper and chopped meat.

When the meat is browned, add paprika, mix and let it stew over medium heat for about 3 minutes. Add some oregano and about 150 g of ketchup. Stir and simmer over a moderate heat, basting occasionally, for about 2-2.5 to 3 hours, until the meat is almost soft.

About 1/2 hour before, we add 2 along the chopped capsicum and while basting (if necessary) we bring it to the point where we add as much salt as needed.

5 minutes before the end, add crushed garlic, enough marjoram and sifted flour as needed. Finally, add 0.2-0.3 dl of good Czech beer and do not boil anymore, otherwise the beer will disappear.

Let it sit for 2-3 days. The goulash born in this way has exceptional taste properties that you won't even taste any other goulash anymore!

We serve it with a good dumpling, onion rings, beer and, for gourmets, I recommend a spoon/teaspoon of sour cream on top.

Сие ""чудо"" прилагалось к антологии FlatOut, которую я брал с 90-процентной скидкой на распродаже.
И я подумал... А что если попробовать??

Как же горько я разочарован - 15 минут достаточно, чтобы попробовать все тупые режимы, не найти привычной и полюбившейся с FlatOut 2 кампании, и благополучно в ""это"" не возвращаться.

А теперь [u] интересные факты [/u]: 
- Здесь вы не услышите приятного уху рока, вы вообще никакой музыки не услышите - лишь бесконечные скрипы от вкручивающихся, млин, гаек и ударов дырявого поломойного ведра оземь. Видимо, ""саундтрек"" писался в сталелитейном заводе.
- Графон примерно как после выпитого литра паленого коньяка (на себе, конечно, не проверял, но зайдя в ""это"", думаю, познал), ну или как во время гриппа, когда тебя мутит и ты полумертвой походкой движешься в сторону клозета, а в глазах твоих странная дымка...
- Никакой управляемости машины нет, то ее заносит куда-то в сторону, то она скользит и скатывается куда-то как слеза, после того как ты только вышел из клозета после предыдущего факта.
- Фактов хватит (я и после предыдущих-то еще не очухался...)

В лучшем случае я бы отдал эту игру куда-нибудь на мобилку - с руками бы оторвали.

This ""miracle"" was included with the FlatOut anthology, which I got at a 90% discount during a sale.
And I thought... What if I give it a try?

How bitterly disappointed I am – 15 minutes is enough to try all the stupid modes, not find the familiar and beloved campaign from FlatOut 2, and happily never return to ""this one.""

And now [u] interesting facts [/u]:
- You won't hear any ear-pleasing rock here, you won't hear any music at all – only the endless creaking of screws being screwed in, damn, and the slamming of a leaky floor scrubber bucket on the ground. Apparently, the ""soundtrack"" was recorded in a steel mill. - The graphics are roughly like after drinking a liter of counterfeit cognac (I haven't personally tested it, of course, but I think I experienced it after playing ""this""), or like when you have the flu, when you're nauseous and stumbling toward the toilet with a strange haze in your eyes...
- The car has no control whatsoever; it either skids off to the side, or slides and rolls off like a teardrop after you've just emerged from the toilet after the previous incident.
- That's enough of those (I'm still reeling from the previous ones...)

At best, I'd give this game to someone on mobile—they'd be a hot commodity.

Not only is it a significant downgrade under all previous entries, but it's genuinely one of the worst games I've ever played. Whatever enjoyment you might get out of this would most likely be for the wrong reasons.

[h1]Positives[/h1]
+ You can play your own music. Which is useful, because the game's default soundtrack is actually awful.

[h1]Negatives[/h1]
- Poor driving controls.
- Poor aesthetics and graphics. It somehow looks worse than the first entry from 2004.
- There's no cohesion with the vehicle selection. There's monster trucks and tanks, both of which are only useful in specific scenarios, neutering their usefulness.
- Demolition derby is based on points gained instead of last driver standing. Speaking of which, rubbing against other rivals gives you more points than slamming into them.
- Poor career mode. Not only is there no buying of cars or upgrades, but there's an event where you have to drive a bus that can't be finished and therefore the career mode can't be finished either. Because said bus isn't fast enough to go over the jump.

finally done with playing with this crap of a game that was bringing down the achievement percentage and now i can finally review this game.

yes i did all the challenges in this game and it was utter dogshit.

First of all 
battle mode ranks you based on points gained no last man standing same goes for big battle mode.
Race is terrible especially the night shift ones.

The night shift mode has got to be the worst race mode ever.
It rains and fogs up your damn road and you can't even see the road in front of you and AI races like crazy making 400km/hr turn (looking at you lvl 30 and lvl 50).
The challenges were bugged to an extent where u couldn't jump over the ramp (Double decker bus) so i had to exploit the respawn technique to by pass that ramp so basically it took me literally 10 mins to finish the race.

Wow this game is a terrible mess!!!
Again i got this in the bundle with flatout 2 and 1.","UGHhhhh

96904928,english,2021.07.04 06:20,❌,✅,0.5961159468,6,"Well here we are. the infamous FlatOut 3: Chaos & Destruction. I don't think I need to say why this game is awful but because I've reviewed every other entry, I feel obligated to release a review anyway. Keep note that while my playtime is 26 minutes, I did play this game outside of Steam for over an hour which I feel was enough to really get a feel for how bad this game is. So this game was made in 2011 and wasn't developed by BugBear entertainment the creators of FlatOut who developed FlatOut 1, FlatOut 2, FlatOut Ultimate Carnage and FlatOut Head-On for PSP as they were busy making other projects, so instead noobie developer Team6 games was given the reigns instead. Most seem to forget this but Team 6 actually developed and released a game on the Wii a year prior just called FlatOut and in many ways it's a precursor to this game, it even has the same menu music and similar physics. That game is terrible though but is often forgotten, FlatOut 3 however is not, so let's dive in shall we?

So..where do I start, well let's just be blunt: Everything in this game sucks. The car physics are terrible and straight up broken at times, sometimes you'll ram full speed into something but you won't take any damage but other times you just love tap something and take insane amounts of damage. In this game you have a health meter unlike other FlatOut games, while in FlatOut 2 you can get out of the race if you take enough damage but it's rare, in this game it happens so often because the cars drive super fast and turn really badly and the tracks are so terribly tight that avoiding crashes or winning a race is near impossible. 

The character selection is a joke as it has nothing but a bunch of generic and bland characters who look like they belong in a crack den rather than a racing circuit, there are also some chicks in here who feel like they're thrown in to get some T&A in the game, it's pathetic. These characters don't even feel like they belong in a FlatOut game and their inclusion only shows just how little care was put into this game.

Another thing that really sucks is what they did to Hotseat, it's just ruined, nothing about it is good. The Mechanics make no sense and the events themselves have awful premises. The best way to describe it is like a bootleg version of FlatOut 2's mechanics for Hotseat but even saying that is an insult to FlatOut 2 and the legacy of Hotseat as a whole. They took the most standout mode of FlatOut and totally ruined it in this game, which given the rest of the game isn't too surprising.

Special events also return and they're really bad. For instance a capture the flag like mode is here and it's horrid because of the physics and the designs of the arenas, destruction derbies suffer from the same problems. Other bad inclusions include a formula 1 racing track, yes a formula 1 race in a FlatOut game, do I need to say more? I just can't with this game, like honestly what else can I say but everything about this game is bad? I'm quite shocked there isn't a single redeeming quality about the gameplay. Oh and did I mention the game does this awful motion blur effect when you drive fast? Like man it's like they wanted nobody to enjoy this game.

Before I wrap this up, I want to say 1 positive thing. Yes you heard me, 1 positive thing. That is the nicely designed exit button on the main menu, it functions great for leaving the game and you'll definitely need it only after a short while of playing, clearly the development focus was spent on this. Ok in all seriousness, this game does have 1 good thing: The Controller support. Surprisingly it functions rather well, it can be used on menus and unlike FlatOut 1 you don't have to use the gas key to select options. It's pretty amazing they managed to make better controller support than FlatOut 1 and 2 which is sad but thankfully FlatOut 1 and 2 more than make up for that.

So yeah as a whole this game is an abomination and you should stay the hell away from it for your sake. FlatOut 3 is an abortion and a stain on life and gaming as a whole. Playing this game will only induce suffering and depression, it hurts me even more being a fan of FlatOut ever since I was a kid, this is without question the worst game I have ever had the misfortune of playing. Stay away from this horrible game and please play FlatOut 1 and 2 instead. The team who made this game should be ashamed of themselves for nearly killing the FlatOut franchise. I'm amazed a FlatOut 4 was even made and thankfully even FlatOut 4 is much better than this pile of crap. Play literally any other FlatOut game than this, save yourself the money and time you'll waste on this, It was the lowest rated game on Steam for almost a decade for a reason, only being beaten out by the dreadful XIII Remake. Avoid this game like the plague, you'll thank me later.

Needless to say FlatOut 3 gets a 0/10, an absolute failure","Well here we are. the infamous FlatOut 3: Chaos & Destruction.

96857732,russian,2021.07.03 12:12,❌,✅,0.5,0,"Сразу же скажу, для фанатов Настоящего FlatOut'а, здесь ловить нечего, если не знать и не смотреть, что это относиться к серии FlatOut, то ещё поиграть можно, НО зачем они сказали, что это может быть FlatOut'ом, оно не может им быть, потому что физика полное г*но, графика для 2011 ну полная х..., ИИ ботов фиг пойми, что делает, в гонках на выживание (дерби по-нашему) они вообще не дают тебе в принципе с места сдвинуться, могут часами тоскать тебя на крыше своего авто и всё, притом толпой... Из плюсов только множество режимов, которые по своей сути FlatOut'у не нужны. Ну и карьеры тут даже нет. А ну и ещё, что там по оптимизации?? У меня вот например иногда бывают слайд-шоу и краши игры... (Печка у меня норм (1660+R3))
В заключение, хочу сказать, что в эту игру можно играть только если думать, что это совсем другая игра, не относящаяся к FlatOut и даже к Carmaggedon (А он тоже хорош)","I'll say right away, for fans of the True FlatOut, there's nothing to be gained here. If you don't know and haven't watched that this is a FlatOut game, you can still play it. BUT why did they say this could be FlatOut? It can't be, because the physics are complete crap, the graphics are complete crap for 2011, the bot AI is completely clueless, and in the demolition derby races (or derby, as we call it) they don't even let you move at all, they can keep you on the roof of their car for hours, and that's it, in a crowd... The only positives are the many modes that FlatOut doesn't really need. And there's no career here either. And what about optimization? For example, I sometimes get slideshows and game crashes... (My stove is fine (1660+R3))
In conclusion, I want to say that this game is only playable if you think of it as a completely different game, unrelated to FlatOut or even Carmaggedon (which is also good)."

95211194,german,2021.06.07 02:20,✅,✅,0.4697945118,0,"Das Spiel habe ich am 03.07.2021 im Shop für 0,99 € gekauft.

Nun habe ich das Spiel komplett durch, habe alles freigeschalten, was man freischalten kann und habe alle 45 Errungenschaften gesammelt. Anders gesagt: Ich habe das blaue Band.
 Dafür gebraucht habe ich ca. 38 Stunden.

Wer natürlich die alten FlatOut & FlatOut II Teile vor Augen hat, der wird davon schon sehr enttäuscht sein, was ich auch gut verstehen kann, weil ich die beiden Teile selbst früher gern und oft gespielt habe. Wobei ich die ab und an immer noch spiele.

Also ich muss sagen, das mir das Spiel eigentlich ganz gut gefallen hat, also an FlatOut kann es jetzt nicht wirklich anknüpfen… Das könnt ihr auch an den Bewertungen anderer lesen… Anders gesagt die Entwickler haben das Konzept zu wörtlich genommen und das Spiel gegen die Wand gefahren.

Wenn die Entwickler das Spiel nicht FlatOut 3 sondern z. B. Crash & Stunt Car Racer genannt hätten, wären die Bewertungen wahrscheinlich eher Neutral ausgefallen.

Ich sehe das Spiel als Arcade Racer an. Wobei für mich Rennspiele ohne Cockpit-Ansicht generell Arcade Racer sind. Die Cockpit Ansicht gehört bei Rennspielen für mich zum Standard. 

Mich erinnert FlatOut 3 an die damaligen Davilex Spiele die es mal gab, die ich auch sehr gern gespielt habe. Manche liebten sie und andere hassten sie. 

Zum Fahrverhalten und Leveldesign muss ich sagen, da bin ich z. B. von einigen Need for Speed Teilen schlimmeres gewöhnt… Anders gesagt ich war davon positiv überrascht. Gut ich habe ca. 5 Minuten gebraucht, bis ich mich an das Fahrverhalten gewöhnt habe, dann ist es aber echt sehr einfach. Bei dem Spiel hatte ich beim Fahren nicht das Gefühl wie bei anderen Spielen wie auf Schmierseife zu fahren.

Gespielt habe ich FlatOut 3 auf meinen alten Thinkpad T440 in 1366 x 768 was die maximale Auflösung des Notebooks ist. Und mit dem Grafiksetup „Niedrig“. War eigentlich ganz hübsch anzusehen. (fand ich zumindest.)

Ich hatte in den meisten Leveln deutlich über 30 FPS das höchste was ich gesehen habe waren 119 FPS im Nachtrennmodus. Meistens waren die FPS aber so bei 60-70. Minimal waren sie bei den 24 Fahrzeuge Megaschlacht bei ca. 8 FPS. Anders gesagt: Ich war positiv überrascht wie Flüssig das Spiel trotz der Intel-Grafik war.

Angefangen habe ich mit dem Rennmodus der echt sehr einfach ist. Auch der Challenge-Modus war nicht allzu schwer. Bei den Stunts muss man auch nicht viel können, da ist es eher das Timing was zählt.

Gut hier und da gab es Bugs… Bei z. B. dem Switjas See im Nachtrennmodus sind die Checkpoints etwas durcheinander geraten. Aber auch die Monstertruck Missionen kann man eigentlich überspringen wenn man den Truck verschrottet und alle anderen auch die Wertung von „0“ haben. Das Spiel ist bei mir kein einziges Mal Abgestürzt, eingefroren oder sonstiges und lief sehr gut unter Windows 10-64 Bit was ich bei vielen anderen Spielen die auch so um die 10 Jahre alt sind nicht behaupten kann.

Bei anderen Publishern sind Bugs an der Tagesordnung von daher sehe ich darüber hinweg, da es wirklich nur um Kleinigkeiten geht.

Ob das Spiel die 0,99 € Wert ist, müsst ihr selbst entscheiden. Im Zweifel kann man es zurückgeben wenn es einen nicht gefällt.

Mir hat es gefallen und ich habe sehr gern die Nächte durchgezockt.","I bought the game from the shop on July 3, 2021, for €0.99.

I've now completed the game, unlocked everything that can be unlocked, and collected all 45 achievements. In other words: I have the blue ribbon.
It took me about 38 hours.

Anyone who has the old FlatOut & FlatOut II games in mind will be very disappointed, which I can understand, because I used to enjoy playing both of them often. I still play them from time to time.

Well, I have to say, I actually quite liked the game, so it can't really compare to FlatOut... You can also see that in other people's reviews... In other words, the developers took the concept too literally and drove the game into the ground.

If the developers hadn't called the game FlatOut 3 but, for example, Crash & Stunt Car Racer, the reviews would probably have been more neutral.

I consider the game an arcade racer. Racing games without a cockpit view are generally arcade racers for me. The cockpit view is standard in racing games for me.

FlatOut 3 reminds me of the Davilex games that were around back then, which I also enjoyed a lot. Some people loved them and others hated them.

As for the handling and level design, I have to say, I'm used to worse from some Need for Speed ​​games, for example... In other words, I was pleasantly surprised. It took me about five minutes to get used to the handling, but then it's really easy. I didn't feel like I was driving on soap like I do in other games.

I played FlatOut 3 on my old Thinkpad T440 at 1366 x 768, which is the laptop's maximum resolution, and with the graphics setup set to ""Low."" It was actually quite nice to look at. (At least, I thought so.)

I had well over 30 FPS in most levels; the highest I saw was 119 FPS in Night Race mode. Most of the time, however, the FPS was around 60-70. The minimum in the 24-vehicle Mega Battle was around 8 FPS. In other words: I was pleasantly surprised at how smooth the game was despite the Intel graphics.

I started with the Race mode, which is really easy. The Challenge mode wasn't too difficult either. You don't need much skill for the stunts; it's more about timing that counts.

Okay, there were a few bugs here and there... For example, at Lake Svityas in Night Race mode, the checkpoints were a bit messed up. But you can also skip the Monster Truck missions if you wreck the truck and all the others have a rating of ""0."" The game didn't crash, freeze, or anything else for me once, and it ran very well on Windows 10 64-bit, which I can't say about many other games that are around 10 years old.

Bugs are commonplace with other publishers, so I'll overlook them, as they're really just minor issues.

Whether the game is worth the €0.99 is up to you to decide. If in doubt, you can return it if you don't like it.

I enjoyed it and I really enjoyed playing it all night long."

Having the (dis)honour of being one of few items on the Steam storefront to hold an ""Overwhelmingly Negative"" review score among Steam users, [b]FlatOut 3: Chaos & Destruction[/b] is an absolute travesty of a FlatOut game, if not of a video game in general. One does not even need previous experience with the preceding titles in the series; even outside of comparisons to its vastly superior predecessors, FlatOut 3 falls flat[strike]out[/strike] on its face.

The key distinction that needs to be made here is that the creators of the FlatOut series, Bugbear Entertainment, [i]had nothing to do with this title[/i]. After the release of FlatOut 2, they were asked by Bandai Namco to develop [i]Ridge Racer Unbounded[/i], and to make up for their ""absence"", the publisher [i]Strategy First[/i] assigned development of the third title in the FlatOut series to [b]Team6 Game Studios[/b].

This is an important detail, because not only it absolves Bugbear of the shame related to the reputation of the series being tarnished, it also gives us information on what we can expect from this title. Team6 are a Dutch game development company with plenty of racing games under their belt... most of them being remarkably low quality bug fiestas with clunky mechanics, no plot or poorly written plot, and unpleasant to the eye in terms of their visuals.

The racing aspect of the game - arguably the most important aspect given that it's, you know, a [i]racing[/i] game - is bland and uninspired. The cars handle nowhere near comfortably enough to make the races enjoyable. 

Before each race you can pick your character model from a variety of awful puns and pop culture references (Zario the Mechanic, Ufer Bull, Pete Saman (being phonetically similar to ""pizza man""); also ""Silen Einnor"" which is the name of Team6's founder spelled backwards...), which changes absolutely nothing in gameplay.

As for the list of racing gamemodes...

[list]
[*] The ""Race"" gamemode is a collection of 6 environments with 13 tracks, each also existing in a reverse variant to pad out the length. You get the Steam achievement for completing the gamemode if you play all the races and their reverse variants. The tracks themselves are filled with many turns unsuited for this game's car mechanics; mountain environment races will often include uphills which the cars have massive difficulties surpassing without nitrous [i]and[/i] a prior rolling start. 
[*] ""Speed"" takes the player to 5 closed F1-like tracks with F1-like cars. The experience is often ""spruced up"" by poor visibility and sight obstructions in the form of uphills before sudden turns... or flames bursting from the ground and sudden cracks forming in the road in the final track of this mode. Nothing to write home about.
[*] The ""Nightshift"" mode is an interesting concept that perhaps could work better in a higher quality game... unfortunately, it's stuck in FlatOut 3. In this mode you race against only one opponent, and the weather in each track is set to a thunderstorm; it's meant to be ""the ultimate test"". Supposedly the rain is meant to worsen the handling of your car, but in my experience the cars have handled just as bad as in the rest of the game.

[/list]

Aside from racing, the series is known for its stunt and destruction-focused gamemodes. FlatOut 3 of course couldn't fall behind... though looking at what we got, it probably would have been better if it had.

[list]
[*] ""Stunt Man"" is all of the crazy ragdoll launching from FlatOut 2 with none of the fun. Often the objective is to score a certain amount of points... which is only possible by hitting a specific target. A 1200 point goal in a ""hit the target"" mission doesn't mean you can potentially score more than that - 1200 is the bullseye, the middle ring is 600 points and the outer ring is 300 points.
[*] ""Battle Arena"" is a destruction derby with 12 participants. Destroying enemy cars is honestly harder to pull off than it really should be because the impacts barely ever seem to do anything and they sure as hell don't feel like you're actually crashing vehicles against each others.
[*] ""Big Battle"" is... the same thing but with 24 cars. No idea why they made it into a separate gamemode.
[*] ""Monstertrucks"" is a series of 5 events focused on monster trucks. Push objects into goals, run over props etc. If it sounds bland, that's because it is.
[*] The ""Offroad"" gamemode tasks you with driving through 2 courses and getting points through drifting, jumping, destroying enemy cars and breaking things in the environment. 
[*] Splatout is FlatOut 3 at its most mindnumbing. You play through basically each map in the game as zombies keep spawning everywhere. You sit on the map for 3 minutes or so and try to run over as many zombies as you can to score points. There is no deeper meaning, no strategy factor, and practically no reason to devote your lifespan to... well, the game in general, but also this mode in particular.
[/list]

FlatOut 3 also includes a [b]Challenge[/b] gamemode, which is a series of 50 events taking the player through most of the game's content. I can only express my commiserations to those who have subjected themselves to the mode in its entirety. I felt the urge to tap out after the challenge which asked me to jump over a gap in a bus which, even with full nitrous power, cannot reach enough speed to pass the gap. The solution is to treat the track as less of a circuit and more of a horseshoe, driving back and forth between both sides of the river. I don't know what Team6 had in mind while designing that, but by that point I'd had enough.

All in all, I sincerely [b]cannot recommend FlatOut 3: Chaos & Destruction to anyone[/b]. It's not one of those games that are so bad that they cycle over into being good because of how broken they are. It's just plain bad, with very few (if any) redeeming factors. No discount warrants the purchase of this game, and I will forever curse the name of the friend who gifted this game to me. 

Seriously, don't buy it.","(Game was gifted to me by a friend, hence why I'm tagging it as having received the game for free.)

Having the (dis)honour of being one of few items on the Steam storefront to hold an ""Overwhelmingly Negative"" review score among Steam users, [b]FlatOut 3: Chaos & Destruction[/b] is an absolute travesty of a FlatOut game, if not of a video game in general. One does not even need previous experience with the preceding titles in the series; even outside of comparisons to its vastly superior predecessors, FlatOut 3 falls flat[strike]out[/strike] on its face.

The key distinction that needs to be made here is that the creators of the FlatOut series, Bugbear Entertainment, [i]had nothing to do with this title[/i]. After the release of FlatOut 2, they were asked by Bandai Namco to develop [i]Ridge Racer Unbounded[/i], and to make up for their ""absence"", the publisher [i]Strategy First[/i] assigned development of the third title in the FlatOut series to [b]Team6 Game Studios[/b].

This is an important detail, because not only it absolves Bugbear of the shame related to the reputation of the series being tarnished, it also gives us information on what we can expect from this title. Team6 are a Dutch game development company with plenty of racing games under their belt... most of them being remarkably low quality bug fiestas with clunky mechanics, no plot or poorly written plot, and unpleasant to the eye in terms of their visuals.

The racing aspect of the game - arguably the most important aspect given that it's, you know, a [i]racing[/i] game - is bland and uninspired. The cars handle nowhere near comfortably enough to make the races enjoyable. 

Before each race you can pick your character model from a variety of awful puns and pop culture references (Zario the Mechanic, Ufer Bull, Pete Saman (being phonetically similar to ""pizza man""); also ""Silen Einnor"" which is the name of Team6's founder spelled backwards...), which changes absolutely nothing in gameplay.

As for the list of racing gamemodes...

[list]
[*] The ""Race"" gamemode is a collection of 6 environments with 13 tracks, each also existing in a reverse variant to pad out the length. You get the Steam achievement for completing the gamemode if you play all the races and their reverse variants. The tracks themselves are filled with many turns unsuited for this game's car mechanics; mountain environment races will often include uphills which the cars have massive difficulties surpassing without nitrous [i]and[/i] a prior rolling start. 
[*] ""Speed"" takes the player to 5 closed F1-like tracks with F1-like cars. The experience is often ""spruced up"" by poor visibility and sight obstructions in the form of uphills before sudden turns... or flames bursting from the ground and sudden cracks forming in the road in the final track of this mode. Nothing to write home about.
[*] The ""Nightshift"" mode is an interesting concept that perhaps could work better in a higher quality game... unfortunately, it's stuck in FlatOut 3. In this mode you race against only one opponent, and the weather in each track is set to a thunderstorm; it's meant to be ""the ultimate test"". Supposedly the rain is meant to worsen the handling of your car, but in my experience the cars have handled just as bad as in the rest of the game. Advertised as ""the most difficult gamemode in the game"", it's held back by technical limitations of goofy AI able to hold good racing lines but losing its head if it's sent off those lines even for a bit.

Po tych 7 minutach mój kebab w żołądku głośno się odezwał i musiałem odejść do miejsca medytacji. Porządnie się wysrałem, aż w końcu nadeszła pora by się podetrzeć. Niestety z moich tylnych kieszeni wypadły klucze, które wpadły do mojego rzadkiego jak kucyk u brunetek gówna. Zostałem więc zmuszony by się zanurzyć w głębie mojego kibla i odkopać moje zaginione klucze. Było źle, aczkolwiek miło było ujrzeć kebaba w takiej formie, gdyż mogłem dogłębnie go przeanalizować jak żony w Ferdydurke, w końcu moja podwodna przygoda w kiblu zakończyła się odnalezieniem tych kluczy, więc wyszedłem z gównolandu, wyczyściłem klucze i siebie, spłukałem wodę i doszedłem do wniosku że te 7 minut w kiblu były ciekawsze niż przy tej grze

OK, więc ograłem tej gry jeszcze ponad 6 godzin, dzięki czemu mogę ją kompletnie zjechać bo wiem co tam jest zdupione:
Wyścigi ""normalne"" - Mamy jakieś typowe sąsiedztwo, Rzym, fabryka etc. z tym problemem że deweloperzy projektując te tory stwierdzili że zajebistym pomysłem będzie danie tych samych tras ale robionych w drugą stronę, co bardziej nużyło i niepotrzebnie wydłużało grę
Monstertrucki - kolejna kaszana, gdzie Super duper zadania to były prostoty typu przewróć autobusy albo wjedź w beczki (samych zadań było 4 i takie typu gówno się robiło)
Offroad - ""Zabawa"" polegająca na niszczeniu wszystkiego po drodze i posiadaniu największej ilości punktów, z tym że punkty dało się łatwo nabić wjeżdżając pod koła monster trucka i wtedy punkty nabijały ci się łatwo jak guzy od kiboli
Nocna jazda - Kolejna ""zajebista zabawa"" gdzie robisz te same trasy, ale w nocy z deszczem i mgłą, gdzie twój przeciwnik zapierdala i wyrabia na zakręcie
Areny - Obydwa typy aren, ta duża i zwykła ssały pałę, bo logika tej gry jest spieprzona, gdyż przewrócenie samochodu na dach wjeżdżając w niego na pełnej kurwie zadaje mu tylko 3% obrażeń, a obtarcie kołami maski zadaje mu 50%
Jakieś kaskadery - Wypierdalasz się przez przednią szybę i nabijasz punkty albo musisz trafić w środek tarczy, to też było zjebane patrząc na to, jak fizyka niedziała w tej grze
Szybkość - Nic nowego, popieprzasz formułą po torze ze zwalonym AI
Wyzwania - Wyzwania też spierdolone, nic nowego nie oferujące, a przy jednym wyzwaniu utknąłem bo jakiś debil w Team orgy 6 stwierdził, że autobus z Anglii będzie dobrym pomysłem na tor z dupnymi rampami
Splatout - Szczerze, to był najprzyjemniejszy tryb w tej grze przy którym nawet się dobrze bawiłem, co nie zmienia faktu że cała gra to totalne gówno","I wasted 7 minutes on this piece of crap. I supposedly finished one race, but it went okay despite the clunky steering. After those 7 minutes, the kebab in my stomach made a loud noise, and I had to retreat to my meditation spot.

So I was forced to delve into the depths of my toilet and dig up my missing keys. It was bad, but it was nice to see the kebab in this form, because I could analyze it in depth like the wives in Ferdydurke. Finally, my underwater adventure in the toilet ended with finding those keys, so I left the shitland, cleaned the keys and myself, flushed the toilet, and came to the conclusion that those 7 minutes in the toilet were more interesting than playing this game.

OK, so I played over 6 more hours of this game, so I can completely blow it away because I know what's so stupid about it:
""Normal"" Races - We have a typical neighborhood, Rome, a factory, etc. The problem is that when the developers designed these tracks, they thought it would be a great idea to give you the same routes but in reverse, which made it more tedious and unnecessarily lengthy.
Monstertrucks - another mess, where the super duper tasks were simple things like flipping buses or driving into barrels (there were only four tasks, and they were all crap).
Offroad - ""Fun"" where you destroy everything on the road and get the most points. However, points could be easily earned by driving under the wheels of a monster truck, and then you'd rack up points like hooligans' bumps.
Night Driving - Another ""fun"" where you do the same routes, but at night with rain and fog, where your opponent is going crazy and slacking off on the corners.
Arenas - Both types of arenas, the large one and the regular one, sucked. The game's logic is screwed up, as flipping a car onto its roof by driving into it at full speed is a real pain. It only deals 3% damage, and grazing the hood with the wheels deals 50%.
Some Stunts - You crash through the windshield and score points, or you have to hit the bull's eye. That was also fucked up considering how the physics don't work in this game.
Speed ​​- Nothing new, you're messing with the formula on a track with a broken AI.
Challenges - The challenges are also fucked up, offering nothing new. I got stuck on one challenge because some idiot at Team Orgy 6 thought a bus from England would be a good idea for a track with crappy ramps.
Splatout - Honestly, this was the most enjoyable mode in this game. I actually had fun playing it, which doesn't change the fact that the whole game is complete crap."

Protože jsem byl zvědavý, hru jsem si pořídil, abych se přesvědčil, jestli je opravdu tak moc špatná jak o ní všichni říkají. A možná vás překvapím, ale za mě se jedná o zajímavou a celkem dobrou hru, která má ale několik zásadních problémů.

Tím prvním je její název. FlatOut 3 má totiž úplně jiné mechaniky a hratelnost než předchozí díly. Když vyjde díl nějaké série, je logické, že ho hráči srovnávají s předchůdci a to je v případě FlatOut 3 velký problém. Třetí díl funguje úplně jinak a vlastně nemá s předchozími díly společné vůbec nic. Přitom hratelnost je podle mého názoru zajímavá a já si nemám na co stěžovat. Kdyby vývojáři zvolili jiný název, měl by třetí FlatOut mnohem lepší hodnocení.

Druhý problém je pár zásadních chyb, které by se přitom daly opravit patchem.
První zásadní chyba nastala v momentě, kdy jsem jel challenge s dvoupatrovým autobusem. Nápad je to dobrý, proč nezávodit s autobusem, jenže tento závod je na trati, kde musíte v jedné části skočit a autobus není dost rychlý na to, aby to dokázal, takže je tento závod nehratelný. Mě se přes něj povedlo dostat tak, že jsem dojel k tomu skoku, pak se otočil jel asi půl tratě zpátky, tam někde spadl do vody a ejhle, respawnulo mě to přímo za ten skok, takže jsem mohl jet dál. Tento problém přitom má velmi jednoduché řešení. Stačilo prostě dát jinou trať.
Druhá zásadní chyba je fakt, že rychlost hry má vliv na vlastnosti vozidel. Stalo se mi, že jsem jel akrobacii, kde bylo potřeba se trefit do terče, ale ať jsem jel jak jsem jel, nebyl jsem schopný k terči vůbec doletět. Řidič vždycky dopadl těsně před něj. Když jsem si pak otevřel na youtube video, všiml jsem si jedné zvláštnosti. V tom videu jelo auto v momentě výstřelu rychlostí asi 220 km/h. Já jsem se nedokázal dostat přes 160 km/h. Pak mě jen tak napadlo dát vysokou rychlost hry (předtím jsem měl střední) a auto mi najednou jelo stejně rychle jako v tom videu a do terče jsem se trefil napoprvé.
Třetí a poslední zásadní chyba jsou Monstertrucky. Ty fungují, respektive mají fungovat, tak, že jsou všichni rozděleni do dvou týmů. První má splnit nějaký úkol a ten druhý v tom má zabránit. Dle mého názorů výborný nápad, který ale bohužel nefunguje. Tady mi přišlo, že se vývojáři asi spletli a dali sem jiné zdrojové kódy, protože umělá inteligence se chová stejně, jako u klasického derby a nebere v potaz ani týmy. Jinými slovy, hned na startu jdou všichni do sebe a je jim úplně jedno, že mají plnit úkol nebo že ničí parťáka. Takže v závěru mají všichni 0 bodů, což pro vás automaticky znamená výhru.
Párkrát jsem se setkal i s tím, že se oponent částečně propadl do textury nebo že jsem projel skrz barák, ale to už jsou spíše menší chyby.

V závěru bych hru i přes její nedostatky doporučil.Pokud ji nebudete srovnávat s předchozími díly a přimhouříte oči nad chybami, můžete si ji i užít. Mě upřímně bavilo ji hrát. FlatOut 3 za mě není vůbec špatná hra, jen je uspěchaná a špatně pojmenovaná. Kdyby si na ní vývojáři dali víc záležet, pořádně ji testovali a dali jí jiný název, výsledek by byl mnohonásobně lepší. Takhle jsme dostali uspěchaný titul, který očividně nebyl pořádně testován a je hráči srovnáván s něčím, s čím se vůbec srovnávat nedá.
Moje hodnocení je 6/10.","This game has a lot of negative reviews, it even holds the title ""worst game of 2012"". Being curious, I bought the game to see if it really was as bad as everyone was saying. And maybe I will surprise you, but for me it is an interesting and quite good game, but it has several fundamental problems.

The first is its name. FlatOut 3 has completely different mechanics and gameplay than the previous parts. When a part of a series is released, it is logical that players compare it to its predecessors, and this is a big problem in the case of FlatOut 3. The third part works completely differently and actually has nothing in common with the previous parts. At the same time, the gameplay is interesting in my opinion and I have nothing to complain about. If the developers had chosen a different name, the third FlatOut would have had a much better rating.

The second problem is a couple of fundamental errors that could be fixed with a patch.
The first major mistake occurred when I did the challenge with a double-decker bus. The idea is good, why not race the bus, but this race is on a track where you have to jump in one part and the bus is not fast enough to do that, making this race unplayable. I managed to get over it by driving to the jump, then turned around and went back about half way, fell into the water somewhere and lo and behold, it respawned me right behind the jump, so I could continue. This problem has a very simple solution. It was enough to simply put a different track.
The second major flaw is the fact that the speed of the game affects the characteristics of the vehicles. It happened to me that I drove an acrobatics where it was necessary to hit the target, but no matter how I drove, I was not able to fly to the target at all. The driver always landed right in front of him. Then when I opened a video on YouTube, I noticed something strange. In that video, the car was traveling at a speed of about 220 km/h at the time of the shot. I couldn't get over 160 km/h. Then I just thought to set the game speed to high (before that I was on medium) and suddenly my car was going as fast as in the video and I hit the target for the first time.
The third and final major flaw is Monstertrucks. They work, or should work, in such a way that everyone is divided into two teams. The first one is supposed to accomplish some task and the second one is supposed to prevent it from happening. In my opinion, it's an excellent idea, but unfortunately it doesn't work. Here it occurred to me that the developers must have made a mistake and put different source codes here, because the artificial intelligence behaves the same as in the classic derby and does not take into account the teams. In other words, right at the start, everyone goes into each other and they don't care that they have to complete a task or that they are destroying a partner. So in the end, everyone has 0 points, which automatically means a win for you.
A few times I also encountered the fact that the opponent partially fell into the texture or that I drove through the barracks, but these are rather minor mistakes.

In conclusion, I would recommend the game despite its shortcomings. If you don't compare it with the previous parts and turn a blind eye to the mistakes, you can enjoy it. I honestly enjoyed playing her. FlatOut 3 isn't a bad game at all to me, it's just rushed and misnamed. If the developers had paid more attention to it, properly tested it and given it a different name, the result would have been many times better. This is how we got a rushed title that obviously wasn't properly tested and is being compared by players to something that can't be compared to at all.
My rating is 6/10."

Плюсы:
- Куча режимов.
- Неплохие карты. (не сказал чтобы они прям вах,но по гонять можно)
- Коллективная игра: Как вы поняли, можно будет зарубится по фану с друзьями после потной катки кс.
Минусы:
- Баги: Сейчас будет ряд багов с которыми лично столкнулся я
- Не работает мышь в меню,и конечно же приходится настраивать все кнопками.
- В настройках графики я не смог зайти вообще в дополнительные параметры графики, потому что игра тупо не пускает меня туда.
- Игра настоятельно требует провести тест производительности, системы в самом шиндовсе,но игре пох*р что на шиндовс 10 эту функцию давным давно выпилили.(Ку юзерам 7 шиндовса)
- Сама игра выглядит как бета версия,и еще куча багов.
- Убогая физика: Мне она не понравилась, какое-то ватное управление,и практически от любого столкновения машина переворачивается.
- Графика: Так же не понравилась, ибо как упоминал выше, игра похожа на бету версию.


В целом покатать и успокоить свои нервишки после очередной слитой катки из кс можно, если же играть на фулл серьезе, то нет, игра слишком багнутая, неинтересная, и просто недоработанная. Покупать как мейн игру не советую, для покатушек после слитых каток кс, по скидону купить можно.

Моя оценка игры: 3/10","Personally, I didn't like this game.
Pros:
- Lots of modes.
- Decent maps (I wouldn't say they're amazing, but they're playable).
- Multiplayer: As you can imagine, you can have a fun game with friends after a sweaty CS:GO session.
Cons:
- Bugs: There are a number of bugs coming, which I personally encountered.
- The mouse doesn't work in the menu, and of course, you have to configure everything with the buttons.
- I couldn't even access the advanced graphics settings in the graphics settings because the game simply wouldn't let me.
- The game insists on running a performance test on Windows itself, but the game doesn't care that this feature was removed from Windows 10 long ago. (For Windows 7 users.)
- The game itself looks like a beta version, and there are a ton of bugs.
- Poor physics: I didn't like it; the controls are kind of sluggish, and practically any collision flips the car.
- Graphics: I also didn't like it, because, as I mentioned above, the game feels like a beta version.

Overall, it's fine for a quick spin and to calm your nerves after another leaked CS game, but if you're looking to play seriously, it's not. The game is too buggy, uninteresting, and simply unfinished. I wouldn't recommend buying it as a main game, but for a quick spin after a leaked CS game, you can buy it on sale.

88233288,russian,2021.02.11 12:42,❌,✅,0.8493516445,70,"Если кто не знает, это общепризнанно худшая игра в Стиме, без шуток. 87% отрицательных отзывов, а те, что есть положительные, при ближайшем знакомстве хвалят в игре ее совершенно лютую неиграбельную трэшовость.
Игру часто скидывают по акции в комплекте с другими частями серии, поэтому есть соблазн купить всю сборку. Но делать этого не стоит, потому что из всей франшизы хорошими являются только FlatOut 2 и ее доработка Ultimate Carnage. 1 - слишком старая, а 4 не сильно лучше, чем 3, вы не станете в нее играть из-за физики, мыльца и клоунов.

Ну а теперь суть подробненько:

- Карикатурные водители, представленные на выбор, с порога задают тон и дают понять, с чем ты имеешь дело, - с пародией.
- Физика совсем не ощущается. Машины почти неуправляемы, игрок не знает, что будет происходить на экране после нажатия клавиш.
- Камера находится очень низко за машиной, поэтому дорогу почти не видно.
- Трассы плохие и вызывают не веселье, а злость. Они состоят из поворотов, вписаться в которые просто невозможно.
- В режиме ночных гонок дорогу не видно вообще, и не столько из-за темноты, сколько из-за спрайтов воды, залепляющих весь экран. И это при том, что карта квадратная, каждый поворот на ней - внезапный прямой угол. А твой противник непогрешим и несется как истребитель.
- В режиме монстр-траков оказалось, что игрок вообще в одиночку собирает целевые бочки, а противники просто катаются по кругу и толкаются у совершенно непонятной сюрной дыры с водой.
- Музыка по умолчанию вообще не играет, это надо включать в настройках. И ничего хорошего я там не услышал, какой-то шум.
- Зашел в Статистику и обалдел. Игра накручивала игровое время в 10 раз. А число гонок, в которых я принял участие, оказалось... дробным.

Правды ради - я все же увидел в игре один хороший момент. Скоростные гонки на болидах (по крайней мере первый уровень) показались мне совершенно нормальными. Но это, разумеется, не спасет картину, когда всё остальное в таком чудовищном состоянии.

Итог. Даже в плохие игры в принципе возможно играть, привыкая к их недостаткам, когда есть хоть какая-то игра, т.е. на прохождение. А здесь просто отсутствует кампания. Авторы вкинули пачку никак не связанных карт и режимов - вот, развлекайтесь. У игрока тупо не появляется чувства, что у него тут есть какая-то задача. Попинаешь несколько уровней, после которых тебя скидывает в меню... и игра удаляется.","For those who don't know, this is widely considered the worst game on Steam, no joke. 87% of reviews are negative, and the few positive ones, upon closer inspection, praise the game for its utterly unplayable trashiness.
The game is often bundled with other installments in the series, so it's tempting to buy the entire package. But it's not worth it, because the only good games in the franchise are FlatOut 2 and its sequel, Ultimate Carnage. 1 is too old, and 4 isn't much better than 3; you won't play it because of the physics, the clowns, and the clowns.

Now, let's get to the point:

- The cartoonish drivers available to choose from set the tone right away and make it clear what you're dealing with—a parody.
- The physics are completely nonexistent. The cars are barely controllable, and the player has no idea what will happen on the screen after pressing the keys. - The camera is positioned very low behind the car, so you can barely see the road.
- The tracks are bad and evoke not joy, but anger. They consist of turns that are simply impossible to navigate.
- In night racing mode, you can't see the road at all, not so much because of the darkness, but because of the water sprites that cover the entire screen. And this is despite the fact that the map is square, with every turn being a sudden right angle. And your opponent is infallible and speeds like a fighter jet.
- In monster truck mode, it turned out that the player is completely alone collecting target barrels, while the opponents are simply driving in circles and jostling each other near a completely incomprehensible, surreal water hole.
- The music doesn't play by default; you have to enable it in the settings. And I didn't hear anything good there, just some noise.
- I went into the Statistics and was stunned. The game was increasing my playtime tenfold. And the number of races I participated in was... fractional.

To be fair, I did see one good thing about the game. The high-speed car races (at least the first level) seemed perfectly fine to me. But that, of course, won't save the game when everything else is in such a terrible state.

Bottom line. Even bad games are generally playable, getting used to their flaws, when there's at least some kind of gameplay, meaning completion. But here, there's simply no campaign. The developers threw in a bunch of unrelated maps and modes—there you go, have fun. The player simply doesn't feel like they have any goal here. You kick around a few levels, after which you're dumped to the menu... and the game is deleted."

However, if you're playing this game for the first time before playing FO1 and FO2, then congratulations, you're still sane.

Overall, the game is an acquired taste, in my opinion. I bought it from the entire anthology for about 150 rubles. After playing for just an hour, I realized this jackass game is a work of art. And now the story...

86525346,russian,2021.01.13 12:17,✅,✅,0.4525862038,2,"Скажу честно - я вообще терпеть не могу жанр игр ""Гонки"", но почему-то Flatout 3 мне понравился.
Начну издалека: когда мне было лет 7-8, я в компуктерном клубе со своими корешами часто зависал во второй Flatout, так как игра довольно фановая и нам она нравилась.

Прошли годы, а я даже не понял откуда у меня в стиме третий Flatout.
Решил я значит скачать, поиграть, и на удивление - игра мне понравилась!
Давайте по порядку, сначала что мне именно понравилось:

- Режимы: тут их много и они почти все годные. Больше всего мне нравятся режимы ""Дерби"" и ""Скорость"".
- Мап дизайн: карты тут выполнены очень годно. Прям конфетка, мне очень нравится) Они выглядят необычно, и красиво.
- Отсутствие сюжета: да-да, именно, то что в этой игре отсутствует сюжет - делает её лучше. Сейчас объясню. Вот смотрите, какой сюжет, можно сделать в игре про гонки? Правильно - плохой. Тут его нет, и это плюс, ибо игра сделана специально для фана.
- Коллективная игра: тут уже по названию пункта думаю всё понятно, в игру можно играть со своими друзьями и это будет довольно весело!
- Физика машин: она тут какая-то упоротая, прям слишком, но это плюс, ибо игра от этого ещё фановей!


А теперь, что мне не понравилось:

- Баги: нет, не подумайте, в самой игре я багов не увидел, баги были по технической части. К примеру: в настройках графики я не мог зайти в дополнительные параметры графики, ибо меня просто не пускало, надо было выбрать пункт ""Да"", а он просто напросто не выбирался. Также игра требует провести тест производительности системы в самой винде, и её не волнует, что из последней, десятой винды эту функцию нафиг выпилили))) (Хеллоу Windows 7)

Вроде как всё сказал, игру советую покупать, если у вас есть друзья. Если будете играть в одного, то через часок - полтора с ботами уже надоест)","I'll be honest – I generally hate racing games, but for some reason I liked Flatout 3.
I'll start from afar: when I was 7 or 8 years old, I used to hang out with my buddies at the computer club playing Flatout 2, as it was pretty fun and we liked it.

Years passed, and I don't even know where I got Flatout 3 from Steam.
So, I decided to download it, play it, and to my surprise – I liked it!
Let's go from there, first, what I liked:

- Modes: There are a lot of them, and almost all of them are good. I like the ""Demolition Derby"" and ""Speed"" modes the most.
- Map design: The maps are really well done. They're absolutely stunning, I really like them. They look unusual and beautiful.
- Lack of plot: Yes, that's right, the lack of a plot in this game makes it better. Let me explain. Look, what kind of storyline could you put in a racing game? That's right – bad. There isn't one here, and that's a plus, because the game is made specifically for fun.
- Multiplayer: I think the title itself already explains it—you can play the game with your friends, and it'll be quite fun!
- Car physics: they're a bit over the top, almost too much, but that's a plus, because it makes the game even more fun!

And now, what I didn't like:

- Bugs: No, don't get me wrong, I didn't see any bugs in the game itself; the bugs were technical. For example, in the graphics settings, I couldn't access the advanced graphics options because it simply wouldn't let me. I had to select ""Yes,"" but it simply wouldn't select. The game also requires you to run a system performance test in Windows itself, and it doesn't care that this feature was removed from the latest version, Windows 10. (Hello, Windows 7)

I think I've said it all. I recommend buying the game if you have friends. If you play alone, you'll get tired of playing with bots after an hour or an hour and a half."

But I though what the heck, how bad could it be? 
It wasnt very expensive either.
And Im glad I gave it a chance.

Its actually possible to play this game and enjoy it as well.
The first thing you need to do, is to get the Flatout 3 name out of your head.
This game has little in common with Bugbears previous quality games.
Forget that, and lets say this game is just called Chaos & Destruction.
And that name, it lives up to.

The game is a low budget arcade racer, 
that is more like a fusion between Split/Second, Destruction Derby and Carmageddon.
And yes it has its bugs and problems.
But the good thing, is that it has been patched up since the release.
Now it is possible to play thru everthing. 

In almost every mode, it is possible to make a lot of adjustments to your liking.
And thats a good thing. Because that makes the game funnier, easier or harder if thats what you want.
I recommend you to learn how the game works, and use the adjustments and unlocked cars to your advantage.

I liked the fact that the game has alot of playmodes, tracks and cars to explore.
Some cars and tuningmodes are hard to control, others are easy to handle.

I've now played thru the whole game and unlocked everything, and I can say that I've enjoyed playing most of it.
Of course there are some playmodes that are better than others. 
And yes, unfortunately the damage system is still off.
But there is no law against only playing the modes you like and the cars/tunings you can handle.

The AI in this game is everything from easy to challenging, but also horrible and cheating.
I found that the easy difficulty was the most fair one, and in some modes also the normal difficulty.
Just awoid the hard one.

The graphics is not exactly top notch, its kind of muddy and 1080p looks more like 720p.
And you also need a good pc to run it smoothly.

The sound is okay, the music is tolerable for a short amount of time.
But its possible to use your own playlists as well.

So in short: if you can handle the issues of the game, learn how it works, 
and totally forget that its called Flatout 3, you can actually have a good time.

Let the Chaos & Destruction begin!

Total Score 6/10","After reading a lot of bad reviews of this game, I was very sceptical.

So basically if you are new to FlatOut franchise, bear in mind this:
FlatOut, FlatOut 2 and FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage made by Bugbear Entertainment (creators of Wreckfest) are absolutely amazing, fun and have nothing to do with all other FlatOut titles which comes after (including this garbage), which are made by different developers.
Thank you.

85220870,russian,2021.00.23 23:11,✅,✅,0.4659926593,3,"По мне так игра весьма хорошая, мне очень понравилась. На мой взгляд, большинство людей эту игру просто не поняли. Они все время сравнивают третью часть с первыми двумя. Но чтобы прийти к пониманию того, что Flatout 3 достойная часть серии, а вовсе не плохая игра, нужно просто вспомнить какими были первые две части этой франшизы. Первая Flatout была закосом под симуляторы с небольшой примесью аркады, а также реалистичной физикой. Вторая часть была уже более аркадной в плане физики и управления. А вот эта часть полностью аркадная игра. В ней вовсе не плохие, а полностью аркадные физика, управление, поведение машин, но при этом во многом реалистичная модель повреждений. Также цветовая гамма и дизайн более несерьезные, веселые и яркие, и это круто. Сама игра стала более драйвовой и динамичной. И это все круто. Касательно графики - честно меня вполне устроила, да для своего времени не самая передовая, но думаю, что если могли бы сделать лучше, то сделали бы лучше. Но с учетом правильно подобранной цветовой гаммы и дизайна, она смотрится вполне себе приемлимо. При этом игра ощущается весьма хардкорной и олдскульной. А геймеры ведь любят харкдорные и олдскульные игры. Если вам не нравится графика, то считайте её тоже частью олдскульности. В игре появилось много новых возможностей - возможность выбирать водителя, настройки автомобиля, много новых режимов, кометы падающие с неба и обстрел с вертолета, много новых классов автомобилей (кстати в машинах я узнаю их реальные аналоги, такие как ауди, бмв, форд и т.д., в предыдущих частях такого не было), восстановление автомобилей, ярость, новые трюки с водителем. Вот куда смотрели все те, кто эту игру критиковал жестко, почему всего этого не заметили? Я реально вижу, что разработчики старались, привнесли в игру много нового. Что во всем этом плохого?! Новые разрабы применили к игре свой подход, свой стиль, они не хотели тупо копировать предыдущие части. Да, Flatout 3 действительно сильно отличается от предыдущих частей, она больше похожа на Carmageddon, Burnout и Crashday, но при этом многие старые идеи никуда не делись. И кстати, дух безумия, сумасшедших гонок и крутых аварий, присущий предыдущим частям никуда не исчезли. А вы какой хотели получить игру от других разработчиков? Я считаю, что разработчики поступили правильно, они старались, реально принесли много нового в серию. В отличии например от разработчиков Flatout 4. Это довольно посредственная игра. Мне не понравилось то, что разработчики четвертой части, почти не добавили новых возможностей, а просто сделали по сути ремейк второй части, с таким же режимом карьеры, похожими трассами, визуальным стилем и т.д., только с другими машинами и обновленной графикой. При этом даже некоторые старые возможности они убрали, а физика и управляемость хоть и косят под вторую часть, но при этом они шибко хуже. Да и оптимизация так себе. Вот это неверный подход. А разработчикам третьей части спасибо за игру. Ещё кстати хотел поблагодарить разработчиков третьей части за отличную игру Super Street:The Game, в которую мне довелось как то поиграть у друга. Игра реально хорошая, в ней хорошая графика, неплохая физика, очень реалистичная модель повреждений (даже круче чем во всех флетаутах), прекрасный тюнинг, машины и гонки очень достойные. Но есть одна серьезная проблема - нельзя покупать другие машины. Это серьезный минус, исправьте пожалуйста эту проблему, добавьте пожалуйста возможность покупать и другие автомобили.","I think it's a pretty good game; I really liked it. I think most people just don't get it. They keep comparing the third game to the first two. But to understand that Flatout 3 is a worthy entry in the series, and not a bad game at all, you just need to remember what the first two games in this franchise were like. The first Flatout was a sim-like game with a bit of arcade flair and realistic physics. The second game was more arcade-like in terms of physics and controls. But this one is a completely arcade game. It doesn't have bad physics, controls, or car behavior, but it still has a largely realistic damage model. Also, the color scheme and design are more playful, fun, and bright, and that's cool. The game itself has become more action-packed and dynamic. And that's all cool. As for the graphics, I was honestly quite pleased with them; they weren't the most advanced for their time, but I think if they could have done better, they would have. But given the well-chosen color scheme and design, it looks quite acceptable. At the same time, the game feels very hardcore and old-school. And gamers love hardcore and old-school games, after all. If you don't like the graphics, then consider that part of the old-school feel. The game has many new features - the ability to choose a driver, car customization, many new modes, comets falling from the sky and helicopter gunships, many new car classes (by the way, I recognize real-life cars in the cars, such as Audi, BMW, Ford, etc., which was not the case in the previous games), car restoration, rage, new driver tricks. Where were all those harsh critics of this game looking? Why didn't they notice all this? I can really see that the developers tried and brought a lot of new things to the game. What's so bad about all this?! The new developers applied their own approach, their own style to the game; they didn't want to simply copy the previous games. Yes, Flatout 3 is indeed very different from the previous games; it's more like Carmageddon, Burnout, and Crashday, but many of the same ideas remain. And by the way, the spirit of madness, crazy races, and cool crashes inherent in the previous games are still there. What kind of game were you expecting from other developers? I think the developers did the right thing; they tried hard and really brought a lot of new things to the series. Unlike, for example, the developers of Flatout 4. That's a pretty mediocre game. I didn't like the fact that the developers of the fourth game added almost no new features, but essentially made a remake of the second game, with the same career mode, similar tracks, visual style, etc., only with different cars and updated graphics. They even removed some of the old features, and the physics and handling, although they resemble the second game, are much worse. And the optimization is so-so. That's the wrong approach. And thanks to the developers of the third game for the game. By the way, I'd also like to thank the developers of the third game for the excellent Super Street: The Game, which I once played at a friend's house. The game is truly excellent, with good graphics, decent physics, a very realistic damage model (even better than any flatout), excellent tuning, and very decent cars and racing. However, there is one serious problem: you can't buy other cars. This is a serious drawback. Please fix this problem and add the ability to buy other cars."

84675000,english,2021.00.14 19:03,❌,✅,0.5,0,"First off this game is not nearly as bad as everyone makes it out to be. It tarnished the FlatOut brand by not coming anywhere near the standards set before it, however there is quite a lot of content here, unfortunately the execution and technical prowess are what's holding it back.

The vehicle variety is very good: muscle, Tuner, Classic, Sport, Speed, Monster truck, Off-Road, Special, and stunt classes are available making around 47 cars total.

There are 13 race tracks, each with a reverse layout, they can also be played at night in the rain.

Races can have up to 16 drivers, derbies can have up to 12 drivers, and big derbies up to 24 drivers.

there are some party type modes including splat out (zombie killing), monster truck minigames, and stuntman mode, all up there are 8 game modes and a challenge series that has you play sequentially through 50 preset events.

This is a jack of all trades but a master of none, there is not enough content in either of the individual game modes to keep it interesting. The physics can be unpredictable at times, occasionally (but not often) glitch out and cause hilarious mayhem, the graphics are of early PS2 quality with some strangely good lighting effects considering the lack of polish elsewhere. The track design can be exciting but overall feels like they were made by a modder and are not intuitive. It captures the atmosphere of FlatOut but overall just feels like a cheap, mediocre mobile racing game that double dipped into the stock sound FX archive.

The Ai drivers are shocking, during races they are very rubber band heavy, some fall behind constantly crashing, while others shoot ahead (this is also affected by the game speed option you can pick before a race, fast tends to have the worst rubber banding), and during derbies the AI lock onto you and create a huge pile constantly pushing you until you get wrecked. Speaking of wrecking, the slightest of wall taps will result in a crash out and a reset, and hit detection and damage allocation is extremely poor, most times dealing 1% of damage upon colliding with an opponent at 250km/h.

Conclusion: if you can get this game for $1 you might as well pick it up for a laugh and to complete your FlatOut collection, you'll also gain a small piece of history having the worst reviewed game on Steam. If you can get it cheap in the FlatOut Anthology bundle, just get that and check it out if you want.","First off this game is not nearly as bad as everyone makes it out to be.

I don't think this game needs any introduction, as everyone knows about this game, considering it is the worst rated game on Steam, a record that was close to being broken, but has yet to be. I am about to rip into this game and tell you why exactly this game has the reputation it does!

History: This game was actually not developed by the original team, Bugbear Interactive. At this time, they were busy with Ridge Racer Unbounded, so to get this game out, they outsourced this game, but instead of going to someone competent, they went with Team 6. They were the same team who ported Flatout to the Wii, considered a terrible port. Why did they outsource the game to Team 6 of all people? And the game suffers because of it! But I guess complaining time is over, let's get this over with...

There is no story

Gameplay: The game is an arcade racer with barely any racer in the racing. You have your standard arcade gameplay stuff, ya know, driving, braking, drifting, and nitro, the basics. It'd be hard to mess that up. However, there is a new mechanic that lets you power up after filling a meter, destroying opponents in your way. Sound fun? It's underwhelming and doesn't even fully KO your opponent, what a waste. When you're in game, you'll also notice that this game has approximately 0 physics. You jump, you go in a straight arc without any form of weight, drifting feels wrong in every way, and you barely go any faster when you nitro. I myself am not really a fan of how the Flatout games play with how their physics work, but this feels so much worse! Doesn't help that collisions are stinky, you smash into someone and only do 1 damage, but someone grinds your car's asshole for 2 seconds and you're at 25 health. Thanks Team 6. Outside of the barely functioning gameplay, there are different modes, including a Destruction Derby (that sucks), super derby (that sucks), collection mode (that sucks), non-linear mode (that sucks), nigh mode (that sucks), minigames (that sucks), and Splatout (that sucks). All the modes suck because the game barely functions, and the ai is poo. Most of the time, it seems like they're drunk because they can barley go in a straight line or even turn, slamming face first directly into a wall and riding it. At this point I'd prefer the overly difficult ai in other games! 1/10! How could this game get worse.... I KNOW!!

Graphics and Presentation: This game just looks so stupid... It's like you took the Nokia Arabic Ringtone and turned it into graphics: Unorganized and messy. Areas do not look memorable at all, and cars are inconsistent too! In menus, they look very dirty and messy, but somehow become clean when you play! Also, say goodbye to memorable characters with actual personality, now we just have stupid parodies that aren't even slightly funny and only exist for the ""Oh I recognize that"" factor. Ugh... 1/10

Sound and Soundtrack: Stock. Just, stock. Everything about the sounds in this game is stock! In fact, the music is so stock and bad, they give you an option to use your own, which I admit would be cool. Keyword: Would. Why? Because it doesn't work, what did you expect? Because when I tried to load a custom song that wasn't a sound effect, the game just crashes. Nice game testing, Team 6. Plus, the game doesn't automatically advance songs, or sounds in this case, meaning the same sound will constantly repeat over and over until you get sick of it, press the D-Pad to advance, and then crash the game because it's terrible and deserves to die! 1/10

Replayability: There is no reason to even look at this game again, not only because of how terrible it is, but also because there is no incentive, like, really! They did not try at all! 1/10, unless you are a masochist, in which case, 10/10!

Final Thoughts: No. There is a reason this is the worst rated game on Steam. The fact a game in a well known franchise like Flatout turned out like this is just..... Ugh. If it wasn't a Flatout game, it'd be forgotten, but this being a Flatout game helped this game get it's infamy! Do not buy this game, not even at a joke, especially at a price of 9.99! The only score this game deserves is a 1/10 with a side of a turd! Team 6, remove this game! This game is awful in every sense, and I cannot believe Bugbear gave this the OK, they had to have at least seen the product, yes? It's the worst game on Steam, by far! It's an achievement of crap, but still an achievement, just in the wrong way. This game basically killed the Flatout series entirely! There was an attempted revival of the series named ""Fl4tout"" which should have been a reboot, but in the end, it did not successfully revive the series, and this game is to blame. This game is awful, in fact, you can say that IT'S JUST BAD!","Flatout 3.... This game..... This bloody game!

Somehow this mostly functional game has worse ratings than Unity asset flip garbage which is ridiculous. You people wouldn't know what a truly bad game was even if it hit you in the face. I don't give a rat's ass if the previous FlatOut games were better, we didn't give Forza 5 a 1% on Metacritic did we? Hell no.

Anyways, rant out of the way, I personally find this game to be a mixed bag. It has some really terrible moments and some really great ones. The fact that there's more than 1 good thing about this game should disqualify it from being the worst game ever. Let's dive into the details.

Physics: Extremely arcadey, beyond even Burnout. Some of the cars have functional handling while others should just be avoided all together. The muscle car class in particular is awful. The tuners have an insane amount of grip for some reason. The monster trucks and offroaders ironically have the most polished physics, which is the two classes of cars I suggest you stick with the most in this game.

Graphics: Nothing to write home about. They're functional, though the camera wobble makes me want to vomit. The nightshift races are borderline unplayable without tweaking some game files. The cars are fine, though a bit crap looking at times. Really nothing that detracts from the game itself tbh.

Racing: Very mixed bag. The AI will rubberband like crazy unless you put it in easy mode. Easy mode is basically fair racing mode and not technically much easier. The racing mode is awful unless you unlock the other cars in the game and have a flatout (no pun intended) multiclass race. The derby modes in this game demolish any other FlatOut game's derby modes and even Wreckfest's, no questions asked. It does everything right, including having large maps, allowing different types of cars at once, not enforcing a contact timer, and best of all, choosing a winner based on damage caused rather than who lasts the longest. But the stunt mode in this game is truly the worst thing about this game period. Don't even bother playing that mode. The monster truck and offroad modes are both awesome and the cars themselves are truly the best in the game in other modes. The speed mode is boring as hell, but the cars are useful. Oh, speaking of cars, you can unlock a TANK that can literally blow opponents up when they decide to rubberband and cheat. I wish every racing game had that, I've always wanted to blow cheating AI up. Too bad it'll crash your game usually. There's also a mediocre zombie mode.

Cars: Despite all cars appearing to have the same stats, I can confirm this is not the case. For example, in the speed class, some are an entire 10 mph quicker. Otherwise, there's an alright amount of variety I guess. You can't tune cars, but there's tunes that make a tiny difference. Really, if you want cars to go faster, you have to change the game speed to fast in the race settings. The worst cars are easily the muscle cars, the handling is literally unplayable in anything outside of derbies. The best cars in the game are the offroad and monster trucks followed by the speed, sports, tuner, and derby cars. The bonus vehicles are more for shits and giggles than actually racing them.

Controls: This game has something that Ultimate Carnage DOESN'T have! You can actually change your controller layout without having to mess with Steam's controller configuration tool. That is actually a very strong point, you'd expect this game to not have it and it's something I said was a huge negative for Ultimate Carnage. However, it's still a bit weird if you don't know what all the different assignments mean. Takes some trial and error.

In conclusion, this game is certainly not great or even good. Awesome for $0.99, somewhat overpriced at full price. It's pretty average, strong points are an excellent derby mode, a fucking tank that can blow people up, the ability to have any car in any race towards the end, the offroad and monster truck cars, and controller configurability. Weak points are the physics, the stunt mode, the muscle cars, the lack of a career mode and upgrading cars, and some tracks being a little confusing at first. This game doesn't deserve to be the worst rated game on Steam. It's not 1/10 like IGN said. Gamespot got it right, it's a 5/10. That's the only review that was honest. The hate bandwagon needs to stop.","This is going to be an extremely unpopular review, but I don't care because most of you people deeply exaggerate the quality of this game.

-----
Ups:
-----





1. Wide variety of vehicles (a lot, to be honest. they also have more than 3 skins most of the time. an example would be the Scimitar)



2. Fun gameplay (at least for me)
-----------------------------------
From 9 gamemodes to 10 made it a slightly better game, of course. 



Race - it's probably the reason why the game exists. The tracks aren't exactly as bad as people say, in my opinion. Only select few are just really, REALLY terrible, like hairpin turns after speeding up to 180 MPH, and quite a lot of zig-zagging sometimes. It's the most ""enjoyable"" mode in the game. Pretty fun, and can be finished in under 2-3 hours, I think. With 1 lap per race event.


Splatout is okay - run over zombies, get the highest combo multiplier and proceed to the next level. It lags a lot on my laptop.


Offroad is nice - when you can finally use the vehicles you've unlocked from previous gamemodes, you can use vehicles such as the Calyx T1 (Formula 1 car), miscellaneous vehicles, and monster trucks  and try to get better lap times.


Speed mode is okay-ish. Not really bad but it's acceptable. Seeing the other race cars crashing into one another can sometimes be amusing. Also it's a bit hard to finish all of the levels.


Battle Arena - Derby mode with 8 or more opponents, with the bad damage detection and RNG values, it makes both Battle Arena and Big Battle hard to complete. The AI might constantly target you most of the time, but you can avoid this by driving in circles, as mentioned in another review. Also the scoring system only counts your TRUE victory if you place number ONE in the leaderboard. You might see that it displays a 0 instead of a 1, and while I'm not entirely sure why that happens, when you finish all of the Battle Arena events in first place, you unlock a one of a kind vehicle. I think this also applies to the Big Battle gamemode. Fun modes, regardless of these problems. For me, of course.


Big Battle - 24 player destruction derby with the same rules as the Battle Arena gamemode.


Challenge - terribly difficult (sometimes), random events with random vehicles (you can't choose your own vehicle) and random opponents.



Stuntman is the second hardest gamemode - since the physics are really bad, sometimes you can't just drag your ragdoll to the place you REALLY want it to go properly, you'll most of the time find out that you needed to move it downwards/upwards a little more. It's kinda hard to explain but I think it's something with the field of view. Also the physics too.


Nightshift - while Monstertrucks has its own degree of difficulty, Stuntman has the crappy physics and Challenge mode is just russian roulette but with more than 1 bullet, Nightshift is in a league of its own.  The track is slippery, it's raining,  every single level is set at night (I think), and you need to win the race in 1ST place to actually win the event.  You have to pretty much do the entire RACE challenge BUT with slippery tracks and agaisnt one opponent. With a lot of fog/smoke. And by a lot I mean a LOT.


Monstertrucks - nightmare. At least for me. Some of the levels are nerve-rackingly hard, and with low framerate it makes it a nightmare to do stuff such as hit 40 barrels. You can make things slightly easier by using the Alarma car, since it's one of the cars with the best handling in the game.
==================================

3. Hard to beat AI, especially in specific gamemodes and when you're using a specific vehicle.


4. Customizable options - You can change the amount of laps from 1, to 3 and 5, choose vehicle class restriction (for the AI), example would be for the AI not to use Muscle class cars. Damage multiplier, which can be cranked up to x2.00, which should've been the default value, in all honesty. People say the damage model doesn't exist, but it don't think this option existed in the 1.0.0.0 version. You can also change the physics from Default, to Classic (I think this should've also been the default choice) and Turbo. Boost healing (when you use the boost, your car repairs damage), and AI difficulty. Also you can change the amount of AI opponents, which really helps you out if your frames are absolutely poop.


5. Fun game - while it isn't the best Flatout title, you CAN do some seriosly awesome stuff like jump on a ramp, do a front/back flip and land on your wheels (you have no control of the vehicle while in the air), do a really smooth turn while braking/handbraking at just the right moment to get a satisfiying turn while not hitting any walls. And you can also play the game normally, race, turn around the corner, break some objects to get the Special bar filled in order to gain invulnerabilty and multiplied damage (near instant opponent vehicle crash on contact with your car, it can sometimes not destroy your opponent, too) and use it just at the right moment when you screw up a turn and an opponent is ready to smack you in the rear. Really, it's awesome and fun.


6. High variety of vehicles, ranging from Supercars, to tuned sports cars and classic cars such as the Cadillac. Of course, they're almost exactly the same in terms of statistics, but they're still good looking vehicles nonetheless. I think there's at least 48 or more vehicles in the game. Didn't know there was a ""Bonecracker"" until I had the latest version.


7. You can unlock gamemode vehicles for all other gamemodes once you finish all of their events - meaning that you can use the offroad vehicles in any mode once you finish all of the events, same for the Derby, Speed, Monstertrucks, Race and Stuntman. (not sure if Splatout vehicles are unlocked once you finish all of the events)


8. Nice graphics - although some compare the game's graphics to Playstation 2 era videogames (I agree), they are still really high, despite turning them down to the minimal, meaning that the game actually looks really well, and even has world reflection, I think.


9. Special vehicles are unlocked when you finish some gamemodes - you can get a Double Decker London bus, a hybrid Supercar with insane handling, a Tractor, and a few more special vehicles, that you can use in any event you want. It's fun.

Downs:
--------




Performance issues when comparing to previous versions (at least on my laptop), freezing when there shouldn't really be any freezing, and of course bad optimization, as expected.

Despite the game description, the physics aren't equivalent to our world's as double decker buses can run on walls, a vehicle can be sent flying in weird angles in very rare occasions, and collisions on walls might make your vehicle just straight up die.


Damage detection and generator - the damage you give and take is pretty much random. According to many reviews can indeed be goin 180 MPH then hit a car on its front end, and still give it 2-10% damage, which is unnacceptable. Although this problem still remains, despite the game not being updated anymore, you can ignore it, well, sometimes.


AI that will sometimes relentlessly chase down the player in Battle Arena and Big Battle gamemodes, making it hard to score points, and sometimes in races, the AI can aim to take you down, which really sucks. Also they can get turn around corners WAY BETTER than the player, which makes them unfair opponents, especially when they successfully turn while at high speeds and you're lagging behind. Of course, sometimes they will be unsuccessful, and slow down/hit a solid object. (wall)



Summary:


In my opinion, there are more Pros than Cons, but you can easily remove the Pros because of the AI problems, optimization, and graphics.



In short, it's a poor man's:

Burnout Paradise, along with Stuntman: Ignition, Flatout and with a bit of Dangerous Driving into the mix. It's not a terrible game, but it could've been better.","Alright, I know I'm gonna get crucified for giving this game a positive review and stuff, but hear me out on this, it's a summary of what the game has to offer.

-----
Ups:
-----





1. Wide variety of vehicles (a lot, to be honest. they also have more than 3 skins most of the time. an example would be the Scimitar)



2. Fun gameplay (at least for me)
-----------------------------------
From 9 gamemodes to 10 made it a slightly better game, of course. 



Race - it's probably the reason why the game exists. The tracks aren't exactly as bad as people say, in my opinion. Only select few are just really, REALLY terrible, like hairpin turns after speeding up to 180 MPH, and quite a lot of zig-zagging sometimes. It's the most ""enjoyable"" mode in the game. Pretty fun, and can be finished in under 2-3 hours, I think. With 1 lap per race event.


Splatout is okay - run over zombies, get the highest combo multiplier and proceed to the next level. It lags a lot on my laptop.


Offroad is nice - when you can finally use the vehicles you've unlocked from previous gamemodes, you can use vehicles such as the Calyx T1 (Formula 1 car), miscellaneous vehicles, and monster trucks  and try to get better lap times.


Speed mode is okay-ish. Not really bad but it's acceptable. Seeing the other race cars crashing into one another can sometimes be amusing. Also it's a bit hard to finish all of the levels.


Battle Arena - Derby mode with 8 or more opponents, with the bad damage detection and RNG values, it makes both Battle Arena and Big Battle hard to complete. The AI might constantly target you most of the time, but you can avoid this by driving in circles, as mentioned in another review. Also the scoring system only counts your TRUE victory if you place number ONE in the leaderboard. You might see that it displays a 0 instead of a 1, and while I'm not entirely sure why that happens, when you finish all of the Battle Arena events in first place, you unlock a one of a kind vehicle. I think this also applies to the Big Battle gamemode. Fun modes, regardless of these problems. For me, of course.


Big Battle - 24 player destruction derby with the same rules as the Battle Arena gamemode.


Challenge - terribly difficult (sometimes), random events with random vehicles (you can't choose your own vehicle) and random opponents.



Stuntman is the second hardest gamemode - since the physics are really bad, sometimes you can't just drag your ragdoll to the place you REALLY want it to go properly, you'll most of the time find out that you needed to move it downwards/upwards a little more. It's kinda hard to explain but I think it's something with the field of view. Also the physics too.


Nightshift - while Monstertrucks has its own degree of difficulty, Stuntman has the crappy physics and Challenge mode is just russian roulette but with more than 1 bullet, Nightshift is in a league of its own.  The track is slippery, it's raining,  every single level is set at night (I think), and you need to win the race in 1ST place to actually win the event.  You have to pretty much do the entire RACE challenge BUT with slippery tracks and agaisnt one opponent. With a lot of fog/smoke. And by a lot I mean a LOT.


Monstertrucks - nightmare. At least for me. Some of the levels are nerve-rackingly hard, and with low framerate it makes it a nightmare to do stuff such as hit 40 barrels. You can make things slightly easier by using the Alarma car, since it's one of the cars with the best handling in the game.
==================================

3. Hard to beat AI, especially in specific gamemodes and when you're using a specific vehicle.


4. Customizable options - You can change the amount of laps from 1, to 3 and 5, choose vehicle class restriction (for the AI), example would be for the AI not to use Muscle class cars. Damage multiplier, which can be cranked up to x2.00, which should've been the default value, in all honesty. People say the damage model doesn't exist, but it don't think this option existed in the 1.0.0.0 version. You can also change the physics from Default, to Classic (I think this should've also been the default choice) and Turbo. Boost healing (when you use the boost, your car repairs damage), and AI difficulty. Also you can change the amount of AI opponents, which really helps you out if your frames are absolutely poop.


5. Fun game - while it isn't the best Flatout title, you CAN do some seriosly awesome stuff like jump on a ramp, do a front/back flip and land on your wheels (you have no control of the vehicle while in the air), do a really smooth turn while braking/handbraking at just the right moment to get a satisfiying turn while not hitting any walls. And you can also play the game normally, race, turn around the corner, break some objects to get the Special bar filled in order to gain invulnerabilty and multiplied damage (near instant opponent vehicle crash on contact with your car, it can sometimes not destroy your opponent, too) and use it just at the right moment when you screw up a turn and an opponent is ready to smack you in the rear. Really, it's awesome and fun.


6. High variety of vehicles, ranging from Supercars, to tuned sports cars and classic cars such as the Cadillac. Of course, they're almost exactly the same in terms of statistics, but they're still good looking vehicles nonetheless. I think there's at least 48 or more vehicles in the game. Didn't know there was a ""Bonecracker"" until I had the latest version.


7. You can unlock gamemode vehicles for all other gamemodes once you finish all of their events - meaning that you can use the offroad vehicles in any mode once you finish all of the events, same for the Derby, Speed, Monstertrucks, Race and Stuntman. (not sure if Splatout vehicles are unlocked once you finish all of the events)


8. Nice graphics - although some compare the game's graphics to Playstation 2 era videogames (I agree), they are still really high, despite turning them down to the minimal, meaning that the game actually looks really well, and even has world reflection, I think.


9. Special vehicles are unlocked when you finish some gamemodes - you can get a Double Decker London bus, a hybrid Supercar with insane handling, a Tractor, and a few more special vehicles, that you can use in any event you want. It's fun.

83145940,russian,2020.11.26 01:30,❌,✅,0.8357378244,77,"Серия FlatOut была для меня одним из самых лучших примеров того, как должны выглядеть гонки. Не скучная F1 со своими прямыми и неинтересными трассами, или NFS, которая была культовой до Most Wanted, а позже опустилась в беспросветный понос. Это были именно те гонки, о которых я мечтал. Тут тебе и гонки в привычном понимании этого слова, преправленные разнообразными  видами трасс и дерби гонок на выживание, и коротенькие трассы, созданные с целью поврезаться друг в друга. И даже особый режим, где нужно уметь правильно катапультировать своего пилота. Первые 2 части подарили мне незабываемый экспириенс......и тут я зашел в 3 часть. Кроме как плевком в сторону игроков эту игру никак не охарактеризовать


1.  Убогие модели машин. Если в первых двух частях на машины было приятно смотреть, это были машины, то здесь это скорее убогая работа геймдизайнеров. Машина выглядит как понос, к тому же еще и камера по дефолту находится очень близко к машине. Ты смотришь не на трассу а на эти убогие текстуры багажника


2. Упрощенное управление. Вот здесь я просто был в шоке. Я не знаю под каких казуалов или инвалидов делалась эта игра, но ты в прямом смысле движешься по четкой траектории лишь  иногда немного меняя ее, нажимая налево или направо. Такое ощущение будто я играю в Free-to-play понос на андройде, над которым не стали заморачиваться и сделали так, чтобы машина сама ехала а игроку лишь казалось, что он принимает участие в происходящем. Я могу сравнить это с древними мобильными играми, когда игрок нажимал на кнопку поворота, чтобы поменять траекторию, заранее смоделированную разработчиками. Тут почти нереально проиграть или съехать с трассы. ИИ все делает за тебя. В первых двух частях тебе надо было потеть, чтобы очередное препятствие на скорости не отправило тебя в мир к Аиду. Здесь же тебе достаточно просто притормозить(а иногда даже и это не нужно) и нажать на кнопку, что повернуть. Причем машина поворачивает под определенным углом в независимости от скорости. Я вот думаю, эту игру разрабатывали точно для игроков, а не для больных параличем?


3. Куча ненужных режимов. В игре есть режимы 1на1 с боссом, гонки по бездорожью на очки, режим в котором надо взрывать бочки на время!!! и режим, где надо сбивать зомби. У меня только один вопрос? под какаими веществами были разработчики, когда придумали и внедрили это в игру? Разработчики, это дерби гонки!!! Игроки хотят гонок на выживание. Нахрена нам выполнять трюки за время? Мы че, в CrashDay играем? А режим с зомби вы подсмотрели из условного Zombi Driver? Может у вас и была идея объединить несколько гоночных жанров в одну игру, но это так не работает. Вы впихнули в игру то, чего здесь опреоре не должно быть. Это не гениальность, это обсер. Вы бы лучше нормальное управление сделали, а не бестолковые режимы


4.Игровые персонажи. Да, как бы странно не звучало, но теперь игрок может выбирать какого водителя посадить в тачку. Только есть одно но! Это ненужно. На геймплей это никак не влияет. У водителей нет каких то уникальных способностей, чтобы это имело смысл, а даже если и были бы, то это еще больший обсер. Мы играем в гонки, а не в кто умеет больше легально читерить для победы. Это бесполезная и ненужная часть в игре


5. Убогое меню. Хоть это каждому на свой вкус, но что эти изверги сделали с меню? Раньше машина стояла в гараже и была изображена с нормального ракурса, то есть смотрелась стильно. Теперь же стоит на фоне какого то говна и на нее смотреть противно


6. Саундтрек. Ну тут текстом невозможно описать как все плохо. Если уж решите зачем то купить этот калл и поиграть, то первым делом выключите звук, чтобы не было желания блевануть после пары минут игры под эту ""музыку"". Я хоть и понимаю, что на вкус и цвет товарищей нет, но это надо быть говноедом со стажем, чтобы оценить такой подгон от разработчиков


Итог. FlatOut 3 это полный провал и большое разочарование. Убогая игра для казуалов и отсталых. Разработчики взяли и плюнули на 2 афигенные части, в которых были крутые гонки и дерби-треш. Вместо этого они решили объединить в своем продукте несколько других жанров и обосрались. Я наиграл примерно по 20 часов в предыдущие части, а в этой мне стало противно на первой же гонке. Даже не сыграв и часа могу смело сказать, что игра не достойна вашего внимания, а фанатам первых двух частей так и вовсе противопоказана. Честно говоря теперь даже боюсь, что там с 4 частью. Хотя, куда можно еще хуже. Моя оценка 0/10. Даже при всем желании накинуть ей хоть за что-то балл, я не знаю за что. Здесь ужасно все. Начиная от машин и управления, заканчивая кучей ненужного контента и противного музыкального сопровождения. Не травмируйте свои органы чувств. Не играйте в это","The FlatOut series was, for me, one of the best examples of what racing games should be. Not boring F1 with its straight and uninteresting tracks, or NFS, which was iconic before Most Wanted and later descended into hopeless diarrhea. These were exactly the racing games I dreamed of. You have traditional racing, spiced up with a variety of track types and demolition derbies, and short tracks designed for crashing into each other. And even a special mode where you need to know how to properly eject your driver. The first two games were an unforgettable experience... and then I jumped into the third one. This game can't be described as anything other than a slap in the face.

1. Poor car models. While the cars in the first two games were nice to look at—they were cars—this one feels more like shoddy work by the game designers. The cars look like crap, and the default camera position is incredibly close to the car. You're not looking at the track, but at these crappy trunk textures.

2. Simplified controls. This one really shocked me. I don't know what kind of casual or disabled players this game was designed for, but you're literally moving along a precise path, only occasionally changing it slightly by pressing left or right. It feels like I'm playing a free-to-play piece of crap on Android that they didn't bother with, instead making the car drive itself and making the player feel like they're participating in the action. I can compare it to those old mobile games, where you'd press the turn button to change the path the developers had already modeled. It's almost impossible to lose or go off the track here. The AI ​​does everything for you. In the first two games, you had to sweat it out to avoid hitting another obstacle at high speed and sending you to Hades. Here, you just need to slow down (and sometimes you don't even need that) and press a button to turn. What's more, the car turns at a specific angle regardless of speed. I wonder if this game was developed specifically for players, not paraplegics?

3. A bunch of unnecessary modes. The game has 1v1 boss fights, off-road races for points, a mode where you blow up barrels against the clock!!! and a mode where you run over zombies. I just have one question? What kind of drugs were the developers on when they came up with this idea and implemented it into the game? Developers, this is derby racing!!! Players want survival racing. Why the hell do we need to perform stunts against the clock? Are we playing CrashDay? And did you get the zombie mode from, say, Zombi Driver? Maybe you had the idea to combine several racing genres into one game, but it doesn't work that way. You've crammed something into the game that absolutely shouldn't be there. This isn't genius, it's crap. You'd be better off implementing proper controls instead of pointless modes.

4. Game characters. Yes, as strange as it may sound, the player can now choose which driver to put in the car. There's just one catch! It's unnecessary. It doesn't affect the gameplay at all. The drivers don't have any unique abilities to make it meaningful, and even if they did, it's even more crap. We're playing racing games, not games where someone can legally cheat to win. This is a useless and unnecessary part of the game.

5. Pathetic menu. While this is a matter of personal taste, what have these monsters done to the menu? Previously, the car was parked in the garage and depicted from a normal angle, meaning it looked stylish. Now it's parked against some kind of crap backdrop and is disgusting to look at.

6. Soundtrack. It's impossible to describe how bad it is in words. If you absolutely decide to buy this Call of Duty and play, the first thing you should do is turn off the sound so you don't feel like vomiting after a couple of minutes of playing with this ""music."" While I understand that there's no accounting for taste, you'd have to be a seasoned eater to appreciate this kind of tweak from the developers.

Bottom line. FlatOut 3 is a complete failure and a huge disappointment. A pathetic game for casuals and the jaded. The developers have abandoned two amazing games, which featured cool racing and derby-thrash. Instead, they decided to combine several other genres into their product and screwed up. I played about 20 hours of each of the previous games, but this one disgusted me after the first race. Even without playing an hour, I can confidently say that the game isn't worthy of your attention, and it's completely contraindicated for fans of the first two games. Honestly, I'm now even afraid of what will happen with Part 4. Although, it couldn't get any worse. My rating is 0/10. Even if I wanted to give it a point, I don't know why. Everything about this game is terrible. From the cars and controls to the piles of unnecessary content and the obnoxious soundtrack. Don't traumatize your senses. Don't play this."

It took all the energy I could muster just to get out of bed in the morning. I was down to my final days and I eventually just gave up and layed in bed all day. One day something inside of me caused me to get up and go check my computer to see if anybody was wondering where I was. To see if anybody still cared.... I saw that I had a steam notification. I felt the most miniscule glimmer of hope as I clicked to see what it was. All of the hope faded as I loaded up the page just to see a hunnnie pop trading card was added to my inventory. I was crushed. Just before I logged off for what I thought was the last time. I saw that there was a steam sale. I decided to take a look. When the page loaded up I saw a few games were on sale; nothing really that interesting though. Then all of a sudden my heart stoped beating and my face went pale. I read the title aloud ""Flatout 3."" To this day I don't know what caused me to stop at this paricular title. It was 25 percent off so I had Just enough funds in my steam walled to purchase it. I downloaded and installed the game. When I launched it my eyes began to water. I felt my lower lip quivering. The title screen alone was enough to make me feel emotions I haven't felt in a long time. Was this it? Was this my purpose? I begin to start a race and am greeted by a wide select of colourful zany characters. I went with the giraffe and a chose a race. As soon as it began, I was lost in the pure detail of the landscape and the individual personalities of the characters. I couldn't hold it in anymore. I began to cry. I felt something. Racing along side these new found friends made me feel like I wasn't alone. suddenly I had a purpose in life. This game is truly amazing and it saved my life. I could not recommend this game more. I hope that when you play this game, It will change your life like it did mine or in my case, save it.

I will now give an in depth desciption of the game and list some of the pros and cons before giving it a final score.

Flatout is an earth shattering fast paced action packed experience loaded with tons of features and playablity. This game is a racing game featuring all of your favourite animal pals. This is game is intended for all audiences and gamers of all skill levels. This game offers just the right amount of intesity so that novice players can pick and play the game easily due to the well thought out control scheme and and level layouts while still remaining challenging for the advanced players. This game also works well at events such as kids birthday parties due to the family friendly qualities of this game and the revolutionary split screen feature that comes at no extra cost. Because of flatout 3s large level and character selection, this game simply never ceases to amuse you. Buckle up and prepare for the adventure that comes once in a life time as every level in this game takes place in areas from all around the world. Why not do a race in egypt or an icy tundra? In flatout 3, the world is your playground. Each level has its own unique and interesting design and level layout. No race plays out quite the same as the others. Each level also comes with its own amazing sountrack. The character picks in my opinion also change the gamplay as well becuase of the unique voice lines and personality that comes with each character. The game overall is very easy to run and looks amazing on high settings. The amount of detail put into the models and the textures of the game is staggering. The gamplay is very smooth and the mechanics are glimmering with perfection. All of uprades and abilities in the game are very balenced and work without fail. This game apart from the previosly metioned split screen feature also presents an online multiplayer experience. You can now face off against all of your chums in a nice hardy game of Flatout 3. Practice offline with bots and bring the heat to any online oponent that may stand in your way! Finally it is worth mentioning that this game features one of the most undeniably prodigious story i have ever play in my life. There is not a single bad part about it. You immedieatly get connected to these characters and want to see it through to the end. To get the full expirience you would just have to play it for yourself. There is so much to exerience in this game it is unbelievable. All of this comes at the low price of just $4.49 CAD. What more could one ask for.

Pros and Cons:

Pros: -Easy to run -Story -Characters -Split screen -Online -Maps -Replayability -Visually apealing -Good soundtrack

Cons -you will spend a lot of time playing this

Conclusion: Overall this is one of the best games I have ever played. Some of my happiest memories have come from this game and I know there are lot more to come. I hope I could convince to buy this game and that you will have as much fun with it as I did.

P.s

See you on the track racers!

Ein Spiel, welches definitv konkurrenzlos auf der Spitze des Olymps für simulations-getriebene Rennspiele thront. Die Gefühle und Verzücktheit, die mich nach dem ersten Starts des Spiels durchzogen lassen sich nur schwer in Worte fassen und lassen einen sprachlos ,sowie glückerfüllt zurück. Besonders die massive Fahrzeugauswahl, die sowohl extremst hochgezüchtete Boliden, als auch untermotorisierte Untersetzte, welche wohl noch vor dem Krieg das Deutsche Reich verpestet haben, sind hier vertreten. Des Weiteren weiß die Charakterauswahl in Flatout 3 zu üerzeugen. Von Stalin (in seiner Truckerphase) bis zum Verrückten Wissenschaftler Patrick H. 100 ist alles dabei. Dieses Spiel muss man erlebt haben! 

25/1","Flatout 3:

A game that definitely sits unrivaled at the pinnacle of simulation-driven racing games. The emotions and ecstasy that overcame me after launching the game for the first time are hard to put into words and leave me speechless, yet filled with joy. The massive vehicle selection, including both extremely sophisticated race cars and underpowered subcompacts that probably plagued the German Reich before the war, is particularly impressive. Furthermore, the character selection in Flatout 3 is impressive. From Stalin (in his trucking phase) to the mad scientist Patrick H. 100, everything is there. This game has to be experienced!

Produkcja swoją premierę miała w 2011 roku i zadebiutowała wyłącznie na PC.

Szata graficzna to wielka kpina, gdyż wygląda to, jak gra dołączana do najtańszych gazetek z grami w latach 2004-2006. Mamy tu okropne oraz brzydkie tekstury w niskiej rozdzielczości, dosłownie całe oteksturowanie wszystkich możliwych obiektów w grze to istne piekło gracza – prawdziwy koszmar. Modele pojazdów, postaci oraz całych tras wraz z najdrobniejszymi elementami to również zwykły żart lub nawet i splunięcie graczom w twarz – wszystko tutaj kuleje, nawet woda czy efekty cząsteczkowe. Dosłownie FlatOut 3 wygląda gorzej niż pierwsza część serii, która zadebiutowała kilka lat wcześniej. Zdecydowanie tutaj należy się ogromny minus za cofnięcie oprawy do dawnych lat.

Optymalizacja to rzecz, o której nie ma co za dużo się rozpisywać ze względu na paskudną oprawę – RTX 2070 z procesorem 9 generacji na najwyższych ustawieniach graficznych w rozdzielczości 1920x1080 (FHD) gwarantuje w zależności od trasy 350-500kl/s. Dodam, że FlatOut 3 nie posiada synchronizacji pionowej i można ograniczyć kl/s tylko do 15 lub 30 co jest dla mnie niewyobrażalne.

Tym razem muzyka do gry została specjalnie stworzona, a nie jak to miało miejsce poprzednio, gdzie to twórcy wykupowali licencje na fantastyczne utwory. Za ścieżkę dźwiękową odpowiedzialne jest Redshirt Theory, Adam di Troia oraz Bitworm i swoją robotę pracę wykonali prawdopodobnie na kolanie – denna, nudna oraz bez tego mocnego brzmienia, które podczas ekstremalnych wyścigów jest niezwykle potrzebne. Okropne, tragiczne oraz bez jakiegokolwiek poczucia czegokolwiek.

W grze tym razem jako tako nie mamy tym razem kariery, gdzie to naszym zadaniem jest wygranie wszystkich wyścigów, tutaj jest inaczej i nie wyszło to grze na dobre. Dostajemy parę kategorii zawodów, które musimy wygrać, zaczynając od zwykłych standardowych wyścigów, przechodząc przez wyścigi typu off-road, nocne wyścigi a kończąc na trasach pełnych nieumarłych – wszystko to jest jakieś bez żadnego smaku i poczucia rytmu, ot tak wrzucone w stylu „masz tu graczu trochę trybów i się ciesz tym, co dostaniesz”. Wszystkie trasy są nudne, podobne do siebie, pełne błędów oraz beznadziejnie wykonane. Dodam, że wszystkie tryby można ukończyć bardzo szybko, gdyż liczba oraz długość tras jest bardzo, a to bardzo krótka.

Pojazdów już nie kupujemy, tak w ogóle to tutaj nie występuje gotówka – wszystko mamy dostępne od samego początku, jedynie co musimy zrobić to wybrać typ pojazdu oraz model i ruszyć nim na wyścig. Tuning również został całkowicie usunięty, wszystkie auta są od razu dopakowane na maksimum i mają jakieś swoje śmieszne statystyki. Najgorsze co twórcy zepsuli i jest to karygodne to prowadzenie samych pojazdów, gdyż ciężko nad nimi zapanować oraz rozbijają się o każdą ścianę, w jaką uderzymy niezależnie z jaką siłą. Najzabawniejszy jest moment, gdy nie rozpędzimy się odpowiednio, to pojazd nie wjedzie nam pod górę, gdyż wtedy stopniowo zwalnia, aż się zatrzyma i dalej już nam nie ruszy.

Podsumowując, FlatOut 3: Chaos & Destruction to najgorsza gra z serii oraz ogólnie jedna z najgorszych gier, w jakie przyszło mi grać w całym swoim życiu – okropna grafika niemalże sprzed dekady, muzyka bez dobrego brzmienia, poprawna optymalizacja, tragiczny model sterowania, mnóstwo błędów oraz brak kariery i nijakie tryby do wyboru. Moja ocena czwartej części odsłony tych ekstremalnych wyścigów to słabe, ale i niestety zasłużone 1+/10.","FlatOut 3: Chaos & Destruction is the fourth installment in this fantastic series of extreme car racing games. The game's developer has changed, this time to Team6 Game Studios, and the publisher has also changed, becoming Strategy First. The game premiered in 2011 and debuted exclusively on PC.

The graphics are a complete joke, looking like something bundled with the cheapest gaming magazines from 2004 to 2006. The game features awful and ugly low-resolution textures; literally, the entire texture work on all possible objects in the game is pure hell for the player – a real nightmare. The vehicle, character, and entire track models, along with the smallest elements, are also a joke, or even a slap in the face – everything here is lackluster, even the water and particle effects. FlatOut 3 literally looks worse than the first installment in the series, which debuted a few years earlier. This is definitely a huge downside for reverting the visuals to the old days.

Optimization isn't worth mentioning, given the awful visuals – an RTX 2070 with a 9th-generation processor at the highest graphics settings at 1920x1080 (FHD) resolution guarantees 350-500 fps, depending on the track. I should add that FlatOut 3 doesn't have v-sync and can only limit fps to 15 or 30, which is unimaginable to me.

This time, the game's music was created specifically for this game, unlike in previous games, where the developers licensed fantastic tracks. The soundtrack is by Redshirt Theory, Adam di Troia, and Bitworm, and they probably did their job half-assed – it's pathetic, boring, and lacks that powerful sound that's sorely needed during extreme races. It's awful, tragic, and lacks any real sense of purpose.

This time, we don't have a career mode, where our goal is to win all the races. This time, it's different, and it didn't do the game any good. We're given a few categories of events to win, starting with regular, standard races, moving on to off-road races, night races, and ending with tracks full of the undead – all of it lacks any flavor or sense of rhythm, just thrown in like, ""Here, player, are some modes, enjoy what you get."" All the tracks are boring, similar, riddled with bugs, and poorly executed. I should add that all the modes can be completed very quickly, as the number and length of the tracks are very, very short.

You no longer buy vehicles, and in fact, there's no cash involved – everything is available from the start; all you have to do is choose your vehicle type and model and race it. Tuning has also been completely removed; all cars are already maxed out and have some ridiculous stats. The worst thing the developers have messed up, and it's reprehensible, is the handling of the vehicles themselves, as they're difficult to control and crash into any wall you hit, no matter how hard you hit them. The funniest part is when you don't accelerate enough and the vehicle can't get up a hill, as it gradually slows down until it stops and can't go any further.

In summary, FlatOut 3: Chaos & Destruction is the worst game in the series and, overall, one of the worst games I've ever played – terrible graphics from almost a decade ago, music that doesn't sound good, poor optimization, a terrible control model, numerous bugs, and a lack of a career and bland modes to choose from. My rating for the fourth installment of these extreme racing games is a weak, but unfortunately deserved, 1+/10."

It's accompanied by a video review that can be found [b][url=https://youtu.be/J4H2PtRHZ-k ]here[/url][/b].[/i]

[b]In summary, I can’t recommend this game[/b]. This game isn’t absolutely the worst game I’ve ever played as Steam would make it seem, since it’s the lowest rated game, but it’s just not worth the time. The driving physics are really shallow, over half of the game-modes don’t seem to be well designed or have terrible pacing, and the game just overall [i]isn’t fun[/i].
[h2] Introduction [/h2]
I was recommended this game from my channel, but I was already aware of it since it’s regarded at Steam’s [b]worst[/b] game by review-count. Anyways, Flatout 3 is a racing game that emphasizes on destruction, as the subtitle would allude to. There’s absolutely no storyline, but there are several game modes. To cover each one briefly:

[list]
    [*]Racing Mode: Three laps versus several other people.
    [*]Stunt Mode: Non-racing, eject your character from the vehicle in an attempt to score points at a distant target.
    [*]Big Battle: You and 23 other cars bump uglies to get points until either you or everyone else explodes in a fiery death.
    [*]Regular Battle:You and 11 other cars bump uglies to get points until either you or everyone else explode in a more intimate fiery death.
    [*]Monster Trucks: Hit things with your big truck, score points while doing so.
    [*]Speed Racing: High-speed racing with hyper-fragile formula cars on a circuit.
    [*]Night Shift: A night-time duel of racing on wet tracks.
    [*]Off Road: Race while gathering points by drifting, jumping, or des[b]truck[/b]tion. They said it, not me.
    [*]SplatOut: Hit zombies with your car, get a combo, get big points.
    [*]Challenge: You get challenged by Team 6 to be a better person.
[/list]

This covers the foundation of what you need to know before we get into the good, so let’s move on.
[h2] The Good [/h2]
I found Stunt Mode to be the most enjoyable game mode. I definitely spent the most amount of time playing it. I feel like I [i]might[/i] like it because it has just about nothing to do with the driving physics in the game.
The game is also very memeable, albeit not good ones. I make some weak attempts at humor in my video.

These are about all the good things I got out of it -- and I’m sure for many, these points would be moot for you. None-the-less, let’s get to the un-good.
[h2] The Un-Good [/h2]
The driving physics are really shallow and easy to take advantage of. I get this game isn’t trying to be Forza or anything, but it’s just that they lack any semblance of complexity or depth. The recipe is to tap your brake or handbrake (depending on how sharp the turn is) to reorient yourself, then hit your super-boost to commit to that direction. This makes just about any concrete-based race, including Speed Racing easy to complete, save for getting hit by your opponents.

The AI plays out pretty terribly. In Night Shift, my opponent consistently crashed on the first turn on the first map. In subsequent maps, it was just short of being common that my opponent would crash and then I’d just [b]not[/b] see them for the rest of the race. In Battles, the AI gets stuck in loops and will just drive in literal circles, even if the last two cars are just yourself and them.

There are also plenty of game modes that just really seem to be poorly designed, either through pacing or mechanics. The Racing modes save of Off-Road are all fine, but that leaves many others. To start, Big Battle and Regular Battle just seem to be [i]off[/i]. If I run into an opponent at full super-boosted speed, knocking them a quarter-way through the arena and manage to do more damage to myself than to them, that’s just not fun. That consistently happened throughout my gameplay.

Off-Roading [b]should have[/b] been fine. The downside is that there’s only two maps to play on. [i]Technically[/i] there’s four, but that’s because the two maps have been reversed. It’s just really shallow -- off-road racing is typically very fun in games, but we don’t get a lot of opportunity to experience it in this game to the point where I wonder why it was included at all.

The two game modes that are pacing nightmares are SplatOut and Monster Trucks. In SplatOut, I constantly found myself driving slower, maybe even at [i]speed limit[/i] trying to keep my combo going. It really didn’t seem intuitive for a racing game to make me drag my speed down for the sake of a combo -- it ended up being less fun and more like a chore. Monster Trucks suffers the same fate where the trucks seem to be just as fragile as the formula cars. I’m not sure what drives health loss, but occasionally me just popping over a steep hill would deal a percent or two without any body contact. Shocks, maybe… but it’s unpreventable damage that can lead to a shortened run. Just like SplatOut, I found myself creeping around the map, staying away from everyone else, just trying to hit my targets. I don’t even think the AI is even trying to compete against you in this mode. Terrible experience.

Finally we come to Challenge Mode. There’s nothing challenging about this mode except for the fact that it’s just making you play the game you’re already playing. There’s no special objectives or experiences to go through -- it’s just having you complete objectives in their relative game mode with no caveats. For example, there are several challenges that are asking you to place in first but the experience is no different on the track -- no new obstacles, no weird circumstances [i](other than them choosing your car… but they’re all normal cars)[/i], nothing new or exciting. They even change up the wording of some of the challenges but are alluding to the [i]same conditions[/i] as if you were playing the game normally, i.e.; [i]”Leave them all behind you.”[/i]... just ask me to place first, don’t polish a turd.

Lastly, minorly, are just some bad experiences and/or bugs I experienced:
[list]
    [*]The game has no tutorial.
    [*]To follow up, each game mode’s instructions are packed into the loading screen. [b]However[/b], the loading screen just progresses to the race without any button confirmation, commonly leaving you without enough time to comprehend how to play.
    [*]Specifically for Stunt Mode, the game tells you to [i]hit the eject button[/i], but makes no effort to tell you what that is. If you’re KB/M, it’s [b]Shift[/b], which I had to learn by looking at the Controls menu in Settings.
    [*]For the offroading maps, it didn’t save any of my scores.
    [*]The game tracks your attempts on maps and tracks, but doesn’t count an attempt if you restart the level from the pause menu. I played a Stunt Mode track for over 20 minutes and only accumulated 4 [i]”attempts”[/i].
[/list]

[h2] The End [/h2]
That just about covers as much in a nut-shell as I can fit. There’s a lot of other written and video reviews that cover different angles, and I can mirror my experience with most of them in case I’m missing anything. I figure that I’d cover mostly my displeasure with the game-modes since that’s what bothered me the most.

In case you’re wondering, Team 6 is still producing racing games. FlatOut 4 isn’t poorly as rated, and they’ve released another game in 2018 called Super Street: The Game, both on Steam, both sitting at [i]Mixed[/i] ratings. I wonder what went wrong internally between everything post 2011 and FlatOut 2.

Vamoose!"" But like, its fine this time, it is an enriching experience, and your personality in the near future will be richer with the experience. The other day, I was playing this game, and my dog (Spittle, don't ask haha) was watching me from behind; as I played my heart out, nearly orgasming three times, he watched and watched. Eventually, he stood up on his back legs, cleared his throat, and said in a creamy and rich voice that I had never experienced sonically before: ""Got Damn son! This game looks amazing!"" I was taken aback, for not only had my dog just spoke, but he is also spoke the truest words ever spoken in human existence. I embraced him, for no longer was he just my dog, but he was an intellectual, a true appreciator of the arts, but most importantly, he was now my closest and greatest friend.

Vamoose!"" But like, its fine this time, it is an enriching experience, and your personality in the near future will be richer with the experience. The other day, I was playing this game, and my dog (Spittle, don't ask haha) was watching me from behind; as I played my heart out, nearly orgasming three times, he watched and watched. Eventually, he stood up on his back legs, cleared his throat, and said in a creamy and rich voice that I had never experienced sonically before: ""Got Damn son! This game looks amazing!"" I was taken aback, for not only had my dog just spoke, but he is also spoke the truest words ever spoken in human existence. I embraced him, for no longer was he just my dog, but he was an intellectual, a true appreciator of the arts, but most importantly, he was now my closest and greatest friend.

Начнем с того, что в этой части игры машины какие-то пластиковые. Например протаранил соперника, а он улетает в небеса. Но при этом машины будто весят в 10 раз тяжелее, после каждого прыжка с рампы приземляются почти мгновенно. Неудобное управление меню (в принципе и в самой игре, оно там кривое), тыкаю 1 раз кнопку вниз, а он пролистывает 2-3 вкладки. Трассы выглядят не очень, но при этом машины довольно хорошо смотрятся.

","I'm warning anyone who wants to write to me about fixing this or that bug. I'm not buying the game to fix bugs, I'm buying it to play!
Let's start with the fact that the cars in this part of the game are kind of plastic. For example, if you ram an opponent, they'll fly off into the sky. But the cars feel like they weigh 10 times more, landing almost instantly after every ramp jump. The menu navigation is awkward (and in fact, in the game itself, it's all screwed up). I press the down button once, and it scrolls through 2-3 tabs. The tracks don't look great, but the cars look pretty good.

Физику машин изменили, теперь вместо ""хрен завернёшь"" - ""режим одинокого пельменя в кастрюле"". Вроде экшена прибавило, но не могу сказать, что стало интереснее. Другим игрокам, вон, вообще не понравилось...

Графика действительно плохая - серая, унылая. Даже хуже, чем у похожего BURNout на PSP была.

Оптимизация хорошая, у меня ничего не проседало. Другое дело, что в дополнительные видеонастройки пускать не хочет, и что ИГРА ПОЧЕМУ-ТО НЕ НАХОДИТ ИНДЕКС ПРОИЗВОДИТЕЛЬНОСТИ))) Во как, проект аж целый род систем Windows пропустил.

Зато геймпад починили русский встроили - вот тут спасибо, без иронии.

Но всё равно такое себе развлечение.","Well, it's not really that different from its predecessors in my opinion. I still don't really want to play.

They changed the car physics; instead of ""you can't wrap it up,"" it's like ""a lonely dumpling in a pot."" It seems to have added some action, but I can't say it's any more interesting. Other players, for example, didn't like it at all...

The graphics are really bad – dull and dreary. Even worse than the similar BURNout on PSP.

The optimization is good; I didn't experience any performance lag. Another issue is that it refuses to let me access the advanced video settings, and for some reason the game can't find the performance index. ))) Wow, the project missed out on a whole new class of Windows systems.

At least they fixed the gamepad and integrated a Russian one – thank you very much, no irony there.

But it's still just so-so entertainment."

У меня есть ощущение, что разработчики не правильно поняли какую игру они купили. По старой русской пословице ""за двумя зайцами погонишься - ни одного не поймаешь"", наверное, на пяти и сам с ума сойдёшь. После прохождения сел поиграть в Burnout  и понял, что на фоне игры 2007 года, эта из 2011 года теряется в болоте текстур. Но есть в игре ""почти"" сбалансированный раздел - испытания. Когда ты едешь по Москве (специально сходил к Кремлю и посмотрел - там совсем другой вид) или Риму на мультяшных машинках, происходит магия и тебя это увлекает. Как это происходит, понятия не имею, но эмоции есть. Пройти игру сложно, я бы сказал проходишь её на чистом везении, а не на мастерстве управления автомобилем. Во-первых, надо в компании (испытания) самому настраивать режим скорости игры. Если вы что-то не можете пройти, то вернитесь в меню и ускорьте игру (например, гонка на автобусах или 23 пункт с трюком). Во-вторых, абсолютно несбалансированный 30 уровень. Он самый тяжёлый, поскольку ночной мод с 4-мя соперниками, тяжёлой по массе и управлению машиной. Сидел над ним час, а потом поправил конфигурации. Это отвратительный момент игры, который портит всё впечатление. Напомню, это аркадная гонка, здесь упрощено управление, зачем вы вносите такой дисбаланс, который нельзя уравновесить опытом вождения? Я в гонки наиграл десятки тысяч часов и при этом мне было неинтересно ждать пока сойдутся звёзды и мы поедем дальше. В-третьих, 10000 зомби? Зачем мне совершать столько бессмысленных заездов?","Yes, we were expecting Flatout, but we got a crash that was a mix of Carmagedon, Burnout, Splitsecond, F1, and Dirt. I have a feeling the developers misunderstood what kind of game they were buying. As the old Russian proverb goes, ""If you chase two hares, you'll catch neither."" Five would probably drive you crazy. After finishing it, I sat down to play Burnout and realized that compared to the 2007 game, this 2011 one is lost in the swamp of textures. But the game does have a ""nearly"" balanced section—challenges. When you drive around Moscow (I specifically went to the Kremlin and saw it—it looks completely different there) or Rome in cartoonish cars, magic happens, and you get captivated. I have no idea how it happens, but the emotions are there. The game is difficult to beat; I'd say you get through it by pure luck, not by driving skill. Firstly, you need to adjust the game speed in the campaign (challenges) yourself. If you can't complete something, go back to the menu and speed up the game (for example, the bus race or the 23rd stunt). Secondly, level 30 is completely unbalanced. It's the hardest, since it's a night mode with four opponents and a heavy car in terms of weight and handling. I spent an hour working on it, and then adjusted the settings. This is a terrible aspect of the game that ruins the entire experience. Let me remind you, this is an arcade racer, with simplified controls. Why are you introducing such an imbalance that can't be balanced by driving experience? I've played tens of thousands of hours of racing games, and yet I was uninterested in waiting for the stars to align and we'll move on. Thirdly, 10,000 zombies? Why do I have to make so many pointless runs?"

[b]Плохо здесь абсолютно все.[/b] Начиная от цветовой гаммы, от которой затошнит даже мертвого, и заканчивая управлением, напоминающим управление коровой на роликовых коньках. Но давайте все-таки по порядку.

Ну значит так! Во-первых, новые разрабы решили, что [b]какая-то там карьера игрокам нафиг не нужна[/b]. Поэтому вместо нее они создали штук 12 различных режимов, от  сомнительных заездов на монстр-траках до истребления зомби. Ведь это именно то, за что мы любим эту серию! Чертовы зомби, стоящие в ряд на дороге и даже не пытающиеся на вас нападать. Фантастика!

Да что там говорить, однажды моя машина перевернулась и я увидел, что у нее нет осей, а [b]колеса просто парят рядом с рамой[/b]...

Когда машины куда-то едут, это отдельная история. [b]Физика отсутствует начисто[/b], даже в самый плавный поворот приходится заходить на ручнике. При попадании в воду, машина взрывается. Да-да! Она взрывается, причем мгновенно, даже если вы едва коснулись водной кромки. Потому что кому-то было очень-очень лень рисовать брызги.

[b]Дизайн локаций[/b] – еще одна отличительная черта этого бриллианта. Тут и железобетонные кусты с метровыми листьями, и вертолеты, которые разносят вашу машину на куски своими ракетами, и поезд, который выезжает из глухого тоннеля и в который ваши обделенные интеллектом соперники будут смачно врезаться, вместо того, чтобы подождать пару секунд, пока он проедет. В общем, я очень рад, что дизайнеры проекта нашли себе хоть какую-то работу, хотя и не понимаю, с каких пор в разработчики игр набирают людей из дурки.

Говоря о вышеупомянутом заведении, хотелось бы уделить внимание и [b]чудесным персонажам игры[/b]. Потому что лютейший кринж – самое лучшее, что можно испытать при созерцании этих существ. Действительно, какие-то там Джеки, Софии – это все как-то банально. А вот поиграть за инвалида с ожогами третьей степени, дальнобойщика с пивным пузом или самого Рона Джереми  - это именно то, о чем мечтал абсолютно каждый. И да, теперь вы можете сыграть за кого угодно, от поехавшей, которая «думает, что она умеет летать, как Санта» до каскадера с внешностью депутата.

[i][b]Как итог, если вы хотите посмеяться, берите. Игра у меня вылетела всего раз, так что работает этот кусок кода более-менее стабильно. Но как продолжение серии – эта игра полный п… Так что даже не надейтесь, что вас там ждет что-то адекватное.

[i][b]Let's just say it right away – handing over a popular series to people recruited off the street was a lousy idea. The third game is top-notch trash, impossible to play with a straight face. In places, it's hard to believe this is a FlatOut game. [/b] [/i]

[b]Everything is bad here.[/b] From the color scheme, which would make even the dead sick, to the controls, which resemble a cow on roller skates. But let's take things one step at a time.

Well, then! First of all, the new developers decided that [b]any career path is completely unnecessary for players[/b]. So, instead, they created about 12 different modes, from dubious monster truck races to zombie extermination. This is exactly why we love this series! Damn zombies, standing in a row on the road and not even trying to attack you. Fantastic!

Let's move on! Now you have access to a dozen cars right away, all of which are a designer's nightmare. Upgrading is also available and consists of some crappy classes[/b] like ""Madman,"" ""Tank,"" and so on. It feels like the game's creators simply had no idea how a car works and were just making it up at random. What can I say, once my car flipped over and I saw that it had no axles, and the wheels were just floating next to the frame...

When the cars are actually driving, that's a whole other story. The physics are completely nonexistent; even the smoothest turns require you to use the handbrake. If you hit water, the car explodes. Yeah, right! It explodes instantly, even if you barely touch the water's edge. Because someone was too lazy to paint the splashes.

The [b]location design[/b] is another hallmark of this gem. There are reinforced concrete bushes with meter-long leaves, helicopters that blow your car to pieces with their missiles, and a train emerging from a blind tunnel, which your incompetent opponents will crash into instead of waiting a few seconds for it to pass. Overall, I'm very glad the project's designers found some work, although I don't understand since when game developers have been recruiting people from the nuthouse.

Speaking of the aforementioned establishment, I'd also like to highlight the [b]wonderful characters of the game[/b]. Because the most brutal cringe is the best thing you can experience when contemplating these creatures. Indeed, some Jackie or Sophie—it's all a bit banal. But playing as a disabled person with third-degree burns, a beer-bellied truck driver, or Ron Jeremy himself—that's exactly what everyone has dreamed of. And yes, now you can play as anyone, from a crazy woman who ""thinks she can fly like Santa"" to a stuntman who looks like a deputy.

[i][b]So, if you want a laugh, go for it. I only had the game crash once, so this bit of code works more or less reliably. But as a continuation of the series, this game is a complete f… So don't even expect anything decent to await you there.

I might even recommend it, but only because it made me genuinely smile a couple of times. But a thumbs down so as not to confuse anyone. [/b]"

Я прошел все играбельные режимы (обычные гонки, 1х1 и подобие формулы). К сожалению, я только к концу прохождения узнал, что в эдакой ""карьере"" можно менять количество кругов, это стоило мне х3 проведенного времени в игре.

Начнем с плюсов:

+ Многообразие режимов (режимов больше, чем в остальных частях, но большинство из них неиграбельны)
+ Фишка вождения (они добавили к убогой физике дополнительное нитро к машине, которое отвечает за прохождение резких поворотов, без него вам в этой игре делать нечего. Кстати, если в начале игры вы не понимаете почему вас заносит при ускорении, то советую посмотреть раскладку управления:))
+ Повышенная сложность (в сравнении с прошлыми частями)

На этом наши плюсы заканчиваются и начинаются минусы:

- Отвратительная цветовая гамма + непонятна сама суть добавления апокалипсиса в эту игру
- Звуки и музыка (звуки - без комментариев, а музыка присутствует только в главном меню, но и она отвратная)
- Физика (на уровне звуков этой игры) PS Если при прыжке приземлиться на оппонента, то его машина улетит на небо Джанната.
- Ублюдские эффекты, отдельно отмечу кольцевую гонку на последней карте в Риме, эта гонка - дно индустрии. Встречает это действо фарами машин, выглядит это будто ты смотришь на яркую лампу, самое интересное начинается при подъеме на Испанскую летницу. Если рядом с вами кто-то есть, то, скорее всего, вы врежетесь и начнется вакханалия. Чтобы понять какой это великолепный участок трассы, приведу пример из моей гонки, где на последнем круге в этих текстурах застряли мои оппоненты, это был единственный случай в прохождении гонок этой игры, где я обогнал преследователей на больше половины круга (обычно это невозможно из-за того, что ИИ тут подгоняет свою скорость и он всегда будет относительно рядом). Вот результат трассы: я - 5:53, 2 и 3 место - около 6:55, а остальные имеют время 8:50+, что немыслимо для этой игры. Сюда же я бы добавил трассу ""Татры"".
Постоянные прыжки по холмам с нереальным наклоном (от этих прыжков реально укачивает), рандом на поезда и ракеты.
- Оптимизация
- Многообразие бесполезных машин, так как при имеющейся физике 95% трасс придется проходить на машине с максимальной управляемостью
- Непонятно зачем добавленные персонажи
- Ультимативная способность (Зачем? Почему она сама используется?)
- ИИ (В обычных гонках практически всегда кто-то будет держаться рядом с вами, да и на само поведение без слез не взглянешь; в 1х1 скорость оппонента иногда бывает космической, чтобы это исправить, нужно запускать ее заново;в F1 сложности никакой нет)
- Просто наплевательское отношение (Маркер начала/конца круга сделан за несколько секунд в пейнте, бывали случаи, что он показывался и на обычных чекпоинтах; Проезды сквозь текстуры в порте)
- Графика и [b]Эффекты[/b]

Обобщая скажу, что игра безусловно плохая по всем фронтам и в нее не стоит играть, если только не хотите пройти ее для галочки, 4/10","It's no secret that this game is the cesspool of the racing industry, but it does have its positive aspects, albeit few. I completed all playable modes (regular races, 1v1, and a formula-like mode). Unfortunately, it wasn't until the end that I discovered you can change the number of laps in a sort of ""career,"" which cost me 3x my time in the game.

Let's start with the pros:

+ Variety of modes (more modes than in other games, but most of them are unplayable)
+ Driving gimmick (they added extra nitro to the car, which is responsible for taking sharp turns, to the poor physics; without it, you have nothing to do in this game. By the way, if at the beginning of the game you don't understand why you skid when accelerating, I recommend looking at the control layout :))
+ Increased difficulty (compared to previous games)

This is where the pros end and the cons begin:

- Disgusting color scheme + the very purpose of adding an apocalypse to this game is unclear
- Sounds and music (the sounds are self-explanatory, and the music is only present in the main menu, but it is also terrible)
- Physics (on par with the sounds in this game) P.S. If you land on an opponent during a jump, their car will fly off into the sky of Jannat. - The effects are mind-blowing. I'd especially like to mention the circuit race on the final map in Rome; that race is the absolute worst. The action is greeted by car headlights, like you're looking at a bright lamp. The real fun begins when you climb up the Spanish Steps. If there's anyone nearby, you'll likely crash into them, and it'll be a wild ride. To understand just how amazing this section of the track is, I'll give you an example from my race, where my opponents got stuck in those textures on the last lap. It was the only time in my racing experience in this game where I overtook my pursuers for more than half a lap (usually this is impossible because the AI ​​adjusts its speed and will always be relatively close). Here's the track result: I was 5:53, 2nd and 3rd place were around 6:55, and the rest had times of 8:50+, which is unthinkable for this game. I'd also add the Tatra track to this list. Constant jumping on hills with unrealistic slopes (these jumps really make you sick), random trains and rockets.
- Optimization
- A variety of useless cars, since with the current physics, 95% of the tracks will require you to drive a car with maximum handling.
- The purpose of the added characters is unclear.
- Ultimate ability (Why? Why is it used?)
- AI (In regular races, someone will almost always stick close to you, and their behavior is truly mind-boggling. In 1v1, the opponent's speed can sometimes be astronomical, requiring a restart to correct it. There's no difficulty in F1.)
- A completely indifferent attitude (The lap start/end marker is created in a few seconds in Paint, and there were cases where it would even show up at regular checkpoints. Driving through textures in the port.)
- Graphics and [b]Effects[/b]

To summarize, the game is absolutely bad on all fronts and shouldn't be played unless you want to play it for the sake of it. 4/10"

Подробно отзывы я не читал, да и в саму игру я не играл никогда. Решил как нибудь сам оценить сия творения. Подумал, подумал... установил игру и решил дать ей шанс. После 15 - 20 мин. покатушек, я понял, почему на эту игру плюются кислотой.

И так! Первое что я встретил, так это ужасную графику. Я тогда подумал, что всё дело в настройках игры. А х..й там плавал. ""У вас всё на максимуме, но Вы ловите вырвиглазную графику и идите на хрен"". 
Что насчёт режимов? Они (с моей точки зрения) ощущаются довольно таки пустыми, бессмысленными и очень скучными. Чего только стоят режимы с зомби или покатушки на бигфутах и внедорожниках
Геймплей игры просто ""Отвратителен"", с большой буквы О. Физикой вообще кажись не занимались. Как будто дали нам игрушечные машины. И не присутствует такой физики как во FlatOut 1 или 2 (который на минуточку, вышли в 2004-ом и в 2006-ом) 
Система улучшений и апгрейда машин вообще стал бессмысленным 
Звук в игре ужасный. В тот момент я хотел уже играть без звука или вообще выйти из игры и удалить её к чёртовой матери (но я продолжил играть).
А ещё в игре присутствуют лаги и фризы. Например, когда меняешь машину или сам цвет. 
А баги! Ммм... это вообще другой разговор. За 15 мин игры, мне попалось как минимум больше 10 багов. А описывать их смысла не вижу. 

Итог таков: FlatOut 3 - это НЕ FlatOut! Это игра (хотя это и игрой сложно назвать) сделанная из г..вна и без палок, которая пытается само копировать всеми нашу любимую игру.
Обходите стороной ShıtOut 3. Лучше уж купите 1 или 2 часть.","I bought the FlatOut game pack and noticed that the threequel had ""negative reviews."" I didn't read the reviews in detail, and I'd never played the game itself. I decided to evaluate this creation myself. I thought about it... installed the game and decided to give it a chance. After 15-20 minutes of playing, I understood why people were so critical of this game.

So! The first thing I noticed was the terrible graphics. I thought it was all about the game settings. I was just kidding. ""You have everything maxed out, but you just choose eye-popping graphics and then go to hell.""

What about the modes? They (in my opinion) feel rather empty, pointless, and very boring. Just look at the zombie modes or the Bigfoot and SUV driving.

The gameplay is simply ""Disgusting,"" with a capital ""A."" It seems like they didn't even bother with the physics. It's like they gave us toy cars. And there's no physics like in FlatOut 1 or 2 (which, mind you, were released in 2004 and 2006).
The car upgrade system has become completely pointless.
The sound in the game is terrible. At that point, I wanted to play without sound or even quit the game and delete it (but I kept playing).
And the game has lags and freezes. For example, when you change the car or the color itself.

And the bugs! Hmm... that's a whole other story. In 15 minutes of play, I encountered at least 10 bugs. And I don't see the point in describing them.

The bottom line is: FlatOut 3 is NOT FlatOut! It's a game (though it's hard to call it a game) made out of crap and without any tools, trying to copy everyone's favorite game.

The 3rd instalment of the Flatout series has nothing to do with it's predecessors. it is a mash of new ideas thrown to the table without any effort to be implemented well as enjoyable experience. There are new racing modes and classes but they are not well made. For example the Stuntman mode which is interesting as an idea, but comes out as annoying and buggy rubbish. Oh and there is no explanation what is needed to do in order to proceed to the next level. Nightshift and night driving courses, awesome as an idea, complete rubbish when materialized as the level lighting is non existent as some points and the player has no clue where to go. The offroad races with the checkpoints all over the place that one has to guess where the next checkpoint is and a tonne of other things badly made.

Pros:
Interesting variety of races
Interesting heavy-techno music

Cons:
Some stages are annoyingly difficult
Cars get easily damaged
Terrible graphics for it's date
Cars tuning is daft
Car models are poorly designed (Buggati front with a BMW rear? seriously now?)

I didn't see the point. It's impossible to win races because when you turn, well, if the car turns, it can't.

-The physics are complete crap, they've completely screwed everything up.
-The set of missions, tasks, whatever you like—it's lazy crap on the developers' part. You customize everything yourself and collect perks, mmm. No challenge for the player. Or...
+It's funny, but the physics are also a plus for the game. Yes, it's not flatout, but if you realize all the cars are fluff, you might even have some fun.
+It's complete crap, but it's fun crap, and I'm not ashamed to say it. If you forget that this game is a continuation of a cult series that was trashed in 2011, it's still fun to play, and I'm not ashamed to say so or praise it for anything.

The game as a whole is entertaining for an afternoon, but without the achievements, I don't see the point of continuing. I'm glad to have it in my collection, but I don't think I'll play it again for a single minute after completing it 100%.

As for the graphics, the game is pretty average for its year of release, but still passable in my opinion, nothing too terrible either!

It's incredibly ugly, it makes me want to puke just looking at it. Trying to cover up the awful graphics and pixels with eye-popping blur and exaggerated anti-aliasing, bravo. Bring this mega-series down to the level of a game from a newsstand that you wouldn't want for free. I don't know what Team 6 is, but someone should shut it down and quarantine it, with a lifetime ban from creating anything. I look at it and can't believe why the hell I paid these idiots for this. SHOOOK. Avoid this, it's truly garbage, repulsive even from the menu. Entering the game causes permanent brain damage, and there's no way to undo it. This is just plain, premeditated rudeness.

人気レースゲームだったFlatoutシリーズを潰した原因とまで罵倒される伝説の作品、それがこのFlatout3です。

……と言うととんでもないクソゲーが出てきそうで期待させちゃうんですが、実際の所は割と普通の駄ゲーレベル。
笑えるバグなんかもありませんし、PS1やPS2の頃ならこれくらいのクオリティのつまんないレースゲームってよくあったよね、くらいの作品です。
恐らくこの作品がFlatoutの名前を冠していなければ、精々「賛否両論」くらいの評価で落ち着いたんじゃないでしょうか。

間違ってもいいゲームじゃないし、クソゲーとしても中途半端。
とはいえこのゲームを遊んだということは他のゲーマーと話す時のネタにはなりますし、セール時（98円）なら話のネタに買ってみるのも悪くはないでしょう。
つまんない……んですが、先述のように致命的なバグなんかもなく、挙動も車が異様に軽いこと以外は案外普通のレースゲームなので。","The review reads in bright red: ""Overwhelmingly Unpopular."" If these words get you excited, then buy it.
Flatout 3 is a legendary title that has been criticized as the cause of the demise of the popular Flatout racing game series.

...which makes you expect an incredibly crappy game, but in reality, it's just a pretty average, dud game.

There are no funny bugs, and it's the kind of boring racing games of this quality that were common back in the PS1 and PS2 days.

If this title didn't have the Flatout name, it probably would have settled for a rating of ""mixed"" at best.

It's not a game you can get wrong, and even as a crappy game, it's only half-baked.

That said, having played this game will give you something to talk about with other gamers, and if it's on sale (for 98 yen), it might not be a bad idea to buy it just for the sake of it.
It's boring... but as mentioned above, there are no fatal bugs, and other than the cars being unusually light, it's actually a pretty normal racing game."

The mechanics are horrible, the graphics are on par with FlatOut 2 (which is 5 years older), the maps are too small, the interface is poorly optimized for high resolutions (it gets blurry), the soundtrack is terrible, and so on.

Os modos Big Battle e Battle Arena (que praticamente são a mesmíssima coisa) são os melhores para rir e, ao mesmo tempo, se decepcionar com uma franquia que teve seu pior desfecho neste jogo (se bem que há uma continuação, que aparentemente é bem melhor que este que vos fala). É um mata-mata de carros onde, em qualquer dificuldade escolhida, toda a IA dos inimigos vai direcionar para você, não importa o que faça. Você terá 30 segundos de gameplay nesse modo e, após, deixe apenas os carros se explodirem em seu carro até ele explodir também. 

Essa obra de arte é tão digna que eu vou enumerar em prós e contras os principais aspectos notados em muitas horas de gameplay (ignore a quantidade de horas registradas em meu perfil, a mídia manipulada alterou para me sacanear).

PRÓS: 

- 796 modos de jogos separados, mas não há modo carreira
- explosões a todo instante, visto que você não joga nunca
- 958 personagens disponíveis para seleção com ótimos lores para interesse do jogador, porém não
- 20494 carros desbloqueáveis, que não serão desbloqueáveis pois você não jogará mais do que 15 minutos em cada modo
- efeitos ultra realísticos, a equipe de The Witcher 3 afirma ter roubado presets da engine utilizada neste jogo
- modo multiplayer, onde você pode desfrutar do conforto de jogar sozinho, pois não há ninguém ativo por lá

CONTRAS: 

- absolutamente nenhum, pois nossos comentários e resenhas não levam de forma irônica e sarcástica tudo o que foi dito acima. 

","A big shoutout to everyone who came here or found out about this marvel thanks to the ""PIJOS"" (Worst Games on Steam) section on the Adrenaline channel!

Don't believe the media hype in this game's reviews; it's all manipulation! Even my comment is being sent with a recommendation for this game, but the system will change my rating, and I won't recommend it because of these impostors!

Is the game worth it? Of course, especially if it's on sale (which is around 2 reais, at least I got it for that benefit) and you're having such a boring day that even this crap will lift your spirits.

Seriously, the game is funny. But it's funny because it's extremely bad. The car handling seems to be done by a potato with a badge saying ""Head of the Kinematics and Physics Department for FlatOut 3."" Using nitro doesn't make your car faster, but for some reason, creates an effect as if your car is being stretched during the turbo boost. It's magnificent!

The Big Battle and Battle Arena modes (which are practically the same thing) are the best for laughing and, at the same time, feeling disappointed with a franchise that had its worst ending in this game (although there's a sequel, which is apparently much better than this one). It's a car deathmatch where, on any difficulty setting, all enemy AI will target you, no matter what you do. You'll have 30 seconds of gameplay in this mode, and then just let the cars explode on your car until it explodes too.

This work of art is so worthy that I'll list the main aspects I noticed in many hours of gameplay, pros and cons (ignore the number of hours recorded on my profile; the manipulated media altered it to make fun of me).

PROS:

- 796 separate game modes, but no career mode
- Explosions all the time, since you never play
- 958 characters available for selection with great lore to interest the player, but not
- 20,494 unlockable cars, which won't be unlockable since you won't play more than 15 minutes in each mode
- Ultra-realistic effects; The Witcher 3 team claims to have stolen presets from the engine used in this game
- Multiplayer mode, where you can enjoy the comfort of playing alone, since there's no one active there

CONS:

- Absolutely none, as our comments and reviews do not take everything mentioned above with irony or sarcasm.

I played a little bit, and that was enough for me. The car doesn't feel heavy; it feels like a toy, in a bad way.

Ну что же, человечество всюду суёт свой длинный нос, ведь жажды исследований и познания мира ему не занимать, так и я не смог унять своё любопытство и купил 
данный продукт, ибо я как любитель покататься, так же как и Айс Вентура любит всех животных(даже летучую мышь), так и я должен любить абсолютно все гонки,ну или почти все,  или по крайней мере хоть немного уделить внимания. Друзья в стиме отговаривают в своих обзорах, брось каку и всё такое, но как я мог не купить сей продукт студии Team 6 Studios, тем более это гонка, знаменитой серии Flatout, тут есть ачиво ну и естественно как же не купить с огромной скидкой за 24 рублика.  Честно скажу что я не поклонник данной серии, но пожалел ли я о покупке? - нет !!! А почему спросите вы ? Да всё просто, ведь дело в волшебных леденцах ))) шучу ...- я всё таки получил свою долю положительных эмоций от игрового процесса:-)

  Сразу оговорюсь, у каждой игры данного жанра есть свои ньюансы, и чтобы вникнуть в физику гонки надо немного поиграть, попривыкнуть, сделать и разобрать пару десятков ошибок и выводов и ты привыкаешь и чувствуешь себя, как рыба в воде, так вот эта игра что-то наподобие ""DarkSouls"" в мире гонок, а точнее пародия на ""Dark Souls"" в мире гонок,  ведь ты не знаешь какая хрень случится за поворотом, да я занял долгожданное 3-е место, но чего мне это стоило, я прошел первый уровень раза с 10-го,а может с 20-го, игра после таких экзекуций просто начинает бесить: авто толком не слушается руля, может от столкновения с мусором войти в занос, NPC могут  стукнуть сзади и ты тоже уйдёшь в занос и всё, начинай заново...и хотя все законы работают для всех, т.е. Вы тоже можете стукнуть противника сзади и он тоже уйдёт в занос, но когда с вами это проделывают NPC в самом конце трассы, перед финишем и вы смотрите, как победа, которая была у вас считай в кармане, в 2-3 метрах, улетучивается - тебе хочется, блин разбить клаву или геймпад  о голову разработчиков - баланс в игре никакой, есть миссии где Вам просто не хватит никакой прочности авто, чтобы просто дойти до финиша, читерные Npc нагоняют вас за считанные секунды и когда ты видишь их быстро приближающиеся стрелочки, ты начинаешь чувствовать что ты словно дичь на охоте, за спиной слышышь дыхание гончих, что ни говори, но это создаёт двоякое чувство: безысходность(вот вот тебя съедят) и как ни странно, что-то наподобие азарта(а вот хренушки вам - не догоните)...правда присутствуют баги, ну куда уж без них родимых)... 

 [h1]  - ну почему, в видео играх я занимаю первые места, а в жизни экзамен по вождению сдать не могу ? - Эмильен, герой фильма ""Такси"".[/h1]
Но всё же,  что мне понравилось в игре?
Это девять дополнительных режимов, кроме отстойного ""нулевого"" режима ""Гонка"":
1.Каскадёр - прикольный режим, где можно поиздеваться над своим водителем, выбрасывая  через лобовое стекло, естественно надо попасть в цель(Y на джостике).
2.Большая битва - улётный режим, где можно носится по арене и таранить врагов (в какой-то из частей ГТА это уже было).
3.Боевая арена - почти то же, что и Большая арена.
4.Грузовики монстры - носишься по небольшой локации и собираешь бочки ...-зачет.
5.Скорость - управляешь каром формулы 1, очень понравился режим: этот звук мотора, а звук сталкивающихся каров сзади просто ласкает слух - приятно )
6.Ночная смена - пожалуй я пропущу...
7.Бездорожье - гонки на джипах, я просто чуть не упал со стула, когда увидел, как машины конкурентов,да и моя тоже, скачут как мячики по ухабам - лолка )
8.Splatout !  - режим зомби, как приятно давить зомбей - зачёт !
9.Испытание - все режимы вместе взятые. Если бы не 0-й и 6 пункты то был бы зачёт.

Перед нами весьма посредственная аркадная гонка, которая проигрывает даже Blur 2010 года, и по игре и по графике, хотя сама задумка очень даже неплохая - разрушаемость транспорта это может и хорошо, но на мой взгляд слишком уж дисбалансна (лишнее обвисание частей машины, бампера и т.д.смотрится не очень эстетично, например мне вспоминаются Дальнобойщики 3, было не очень приятно ездить с сильно обвисшими частями - просто сделали бы там вмятины, царапины, дымящийся кузов наконец - было бы норм), сделай бы разработчик, например, чтобы красиво и со звуком, сыпались всякие там гайки от машины при соударении или что другое, и подкрути бы графу, баланс, немного переработав уровни в режиме Гонка, да и режимы можно было встроить в кампанию, как в Blur  и вышла бы конфетка !!! Можно сколь угодно долго фантазировать на тему доработки игры, например сейчас модно стало делать игры-гибриды - сделать гараж с купленными авто, возможность покупки новых девайсов и брони, а так же вшить Рпг составляющую, ан нет, такое создателям в голову видать не приходило. Поиграть можно, но относится ""серьёзно"" к данному продукту не могу...халтура вызывает скепсис, а положительные моменты - примесь небольшой улыбки - вот моя оценка )

Flatout 3: Chaos & Destruction
[/h1][/code]
[list]
[*] Genre: Arcade racing.
[*] Released: December 14, 2011
[/list]
Well, humanity pokes its long nose into everything, as it has no shortage of exploration and knowledge of the world. So, I couldn't curb my curiosity and bought this product.
Because, just as I love racing, just as Ice Venture loves all animals (even bats), I should love absolutely all racing games, or at least pay some attention to them. My Steam friends are trying to talk me out of it in their reviews, like, ""Drop the crap and all that,"" but how could I not buy this Team 6 Studios product? Especially since it's a racing game from the famous Flatout series. There's an achievement, and of course, how could I not buy it with a huge discount of 24 rubles? Honestly, I'm not a fan of the series, but did I regret buying it? No! Why, you ask? It's simple, because it's all about the magic candies. Just kidding... I still got my share of positive emotions from the gameplay. :-)

[h1]
- My car is a disaster, I bought it for $500. - $500 for this? )))
\Danila Bagrov's dialogue with the truck driver from the movie Brother 2\ [/h1]
I'll say right away that every game in this genre has its own nuances, and to understand the physics of racing, you need to play a little, get used to it, make and analyze a couple dozen mistakes and conclusions, and you get used to it and feel like a fish in water. So this game is something like ""Dark Souls"" in the world of racing, or rather, a parody of ""Dark Souls"" in the world of racing, because you never know what kind of crap will happen around the corner. Yes, I took the long-awaited 3rd place, but what did it cost me? I completed the first level on the 10th try, or maybe the 20th. After such tortures, the game just starts to irritate: the car doesn't really respond to the steering wheel, it can go into a skid from a collision with debris, NPCs can hit you from behind and you too will go into a skid. skid and that's it, start over...and although all laws work for everyone, i.e. You can also hit an enemy from behind, and they'll skid, too, but when NPCs do this to you at the very end of the track, just before the finish line, and you watch the victory you had practically in your pocket, 2-3 meters away, vanish, you want to smash your keyboard or gamepad over the developers' heads. The game is unbalanced. There are missions where your car simply won't have enough durability to even reach the finish line. Cheating NPCs catch up to you in seconds, and when you see their rapidly approaching arrows, you begin to feel like you're a hunted animal, hearing the breathing of hounds behind you. Whatever you say, it creates a dual feeling: hopelessness (they're about to eat you) and, oddly enough, a kind of excitement (but no way, you won't catch up)... True, there are bugs, but what would you do without them?)...

[h1] - Why is it that I take first place in video games, but I can't pass a driving test in real life? - Emilien, the hero of the movie ""Taxi.""[/h1]
But what did I like about the game?
These are the nine additional modes, besides the crappy ""zero"" ""Race"" mode:
1. Stunt - a cool mode where you can torment your driver by throwing them through the windshield. Naturally, you have to hit the target (Y on the joystick).
2. Grand Battle - a crazy mode where you can race around an arena and ram enemies (this has already happened in some GTA game).
3. Battle Arena - almost the same as the Grand Arena.
4. Monster Trucks - you race around a small location and collect barrels... ok.
5. Speed ​​- you drive a Formula 1 car, I really liked this mode: the sound of the engine, and the sound of cars colliding behind you is simply delightful – nice )
6. Night Shift - I think I'll skip this...
7. Off-Road - Jeep racing, I almost fell out of my chair when I saw the competitors' cars, and mine too, bouncing like balls over the bumps – lol )
8. Splatout! - Zombie mode, how satisfying it is to crush zombies – awesome!
9. Challenge - all modes combined. If it weren't for points 0 and 6, it would have been awesome.

[h1]
Verdict.
- The meeting place is at the zoo.
- Why at the zoo?
""So they wouldn't recognize you.""
This is a pretty mediocre arcade racing game, which even loses to Blur from 2010, both in terms of gameplay and graphics. The concept itself is quite good – destructible vehicles might be a good thing, but in my opinion, it's too unbalanced (the excess sagging of car parts, bumpers, etc., doesn't look very aesthetically pleasing. For example, I'm reminded of Truckers 3, which wasn't very pleasant to drive with such sagging parts – they could have just added dents, scratches, and a smoking car body – it would have been fine). If the developer had made it look nicer and had sound effects, like nuts and bolts flying off the car on impact or something else, and tweaked the graphics and balance, slightly reworked the levels in Race mode, and even integrated the modes into the campaign, like in Blur, it would have been a gem! You can fantasize about improving the game as much as you want. For example, it's become fashionable to make hybrid games—a garage with purchased cars, the ability to buy new devices and armor, and even add an RPG element—but no, it seems the creators never even considered that. It's playable, but I can't take this product ""seriously""... The hackwork makes me skeptical, and the positive aspects—a little smile mixed in—that's my assessment.

Если бы игра была выложена в какой-нибудь Google Play с названием ""Derby Racing 3D 2019"", то я уверен, что большинство бы её купило и не пожалело, но не больше 50-100 рублей, больше она просто не стоит. Поиграл я во все режимы и плевался по началу, но спустя минут 20 игры, некоторые режимы показались интересными и увлекательными для каких-нибудь долгих поездок или для стояния в очереди. Например режим зомби, очень даже затягивает. По сути это просто FlatOut (Но не он!) с Wii, просто немного улучшен. Музыка тоже не топ, но благо я её не услышал (Просто не играла, видать баг). Зато в файлах прослушал отдельно и для мобильной игры она не совсем уж и плоха. Да, на андроид была FlatOut Stuntman от этих же разрабов, но она только для Nvidia, а жаль. Режим трюков без физики и с большим подгоранием 5 точки очень даже ничего, опять же, только для мобилок. Как FlatOut 3-она очень плохая, а как гонка на юнити для смартфонов-неплоха. Это просто моё мнение и оно естественно отличается от вашего, всего доброго дочитавшим до этого места).","I might seem strange, but this game isn't complete crap, as many people are making it out to be. I'll say right away that it's not FlatOut! (I've played them all). If the game were released on Google Play under the name ""Derby Racing 3D 2019,"" I'm sure most people would buy it and wouldn't regret it, but it's not worth more than 50-100 rubles. I played all the modes and didn't care at first, but after about 20 minutes of play, some modes actually seemed interesting and engaging for long drives or standing in line. The zombie mode, for example, is quite addictive. Essentially, it's just FlatOut (not that!) on the Wii, just slightly improved. The music isn't great either, but thankfully I didn't hear it (I just didn't play it, so it must be a bug). However, I listened to the files separately, and for a mobile game, it's not that bad. Yes, there was FlatOut Stuntman for Android from the same developers, but it was only for Nvidia, which is a shame. The stunt mode, without physics and with a lot of 5th-point burnout, is quite good, again, only for mobile. As FlatOut 3, it's very bad, but as a Unity racing game for smartphones, it's not bad. This is just my opinion, and it naturally differs from yours. All the best to those who read this far."

The handling is indescribably bad. The devs tried to go for a simple arcade-y handling, resulting in all the vehicles barely being able to turn, which means you will probably end up crashing into something you were frantically trying to avoid 5 seconds before the impact.
The AI is just garbage, making the outcome of a race or battle purely random. There is no common sense behind some of the decisions made by the other drivers. Sometimes they just become suicidal and go full speed into a brick wall, while other times they are just unbeatable, godlike drivers.
The damage physics make no sense. A crash in 200+ km/t can give you 5% damage, and barely scraping by a brick wall gives you 30% damage. Somewhat comparable to Russian Roulette

And really the most important part of this review, literally the only thing that separates it from the fun terrible meme games to just a huge steaming pile of garbage: The optimization.
This game crashes constantly. It could crash once every 3 hours, or like my case, it could crash every 5 minutes. It could crash at the end of a particular race, or in the middle of the main menu 15 seconds after launching the game. Hadn't it been for these constant crashes I could honestly recommend this game purely for the batshit insane things happening in this haunted hellhole of a game. But that doesn't matter if you can't even get to the fun stuff at the other side of the crashing nightmare which is the main menu.

I just can't recommend this game, not even for the 1$ sales it constantly goes on. Because I know that money goes to the devs, and they just don't deserve that money. If it was optimized, fine. But when a game crashes this much, it's just impossible for me to say it's worth it.

Steer far far clear of this dev studio, and stay with Bugbear. At least they know how to make a game.","This really is a travesty of a racing title and I don't wonder for a tenth of a second as to why it's (at the time of writing this) the worst rated game on Steam.

这游戏是这部之前作品中比赛类型最多的一部咯~足足10种撞车模式~
没有车辆改装购买，只有任务解锁机制~emm~哼(￢︿̫̿￢☆)~

而且支持成就（除了4代外唯一一部支持成就的咯~）
~2个小时就能解锁8个成就~
但是画面确是4部作品中最差的，而且声音非常假，完全就是在以次充好！

I remember being amazed at Onslaught 2's beautiful graphics, the exhilarating crashing, and the flying character~
Then I looked at the developer~ok~I get it~the developer changed, no wonder the quality is so poor!

This game has the most racing types among the previous games~a full 10 crash modes~
There are no car modifications to purchase, only missions to unlock~emm~hum~(￢︿̫̿￢☆)~

It also has achievements (the only one besides the 4th game that does~)~~8 achievements can be unlocked in 2 hours~
But the graphics are definitely the worst of the four games, and the sound effects are incredibly fake. It's completely shoddy!
At first, I almost thought there was a bug in the game—the engine sound was gone, but it turns out it was just fake and low-pitched!

~Of course~ Since I got 8 achievements in 2 hours of play~ I'll give it a good review~ After all, it's an old game~

не ну типа серьезно...в своё время когда игра только вышла я как поклонник серии запустил её и выключил после первой гонки. Тогда я конечно удивился, но это было ещё до первого моего обзора, да и вообще я тогда в игры особо не играл, а учился больше и короче я не обратил внимания. Сейчас же я такой запустил и

Мой обзор на ютубе, если лень читать :D
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyYP9j0e_Pk

серьезно я был в ступоре первые наверное минут 15. Я просто не мог осмыслить происходящее, я не понимал что я вижу и что происходит. Как это могло случиться? Как в такой суперкрутой и популярной серии могло выйти это? Игра которая плоха в...тут я хотел сказать АБСОЛЮТНО во всём, но прикиньте я нашёл плюсы (об этом чуть позже). Конечно, догадаться не сложно - издатель решил подзаработать на бренде и подписал на разработку студию Team6, которая уже лет 20 как выпускает по две-три гонки в ГОД и выпустила такие шедевры как Taxi Racer London 2, Big City Racer и Road Rage! Последняя игра кстати 2017 года выхода и... она всё такая же параша, причем вышла даже на ПС4 - представляете? Это их реально политика студии выпускать лютое говнище и типа так и должно быть! Я уже вижу как на входе в офис студии тебя встречает логотип с надписью TEAM6 - ВЫПУСКАЕМ ХУЕТУ УЖЕ 20 ЛЕТ.

Ну да ладна. Конечно, пожелаем всем причастным смерти ибо заслужили - так испоганить любимую всеми гонку это надо постараться. Талант нужен - в конце концов сделали же блэт самую задизлайканную игру в СТИМ, то есть наибольший процент отрицательных обзоров именно у флат аут 3, вот такая рубрика интересные факты. Достижение разблокировано! Хули делать лучшие игры, когда их дохера - это легко и не круто. Ты вот сделай худшую! Вот это челлендж я считаю!

Что касается самой игры - она вышла в 2010, но выглядит и играется прямо как в 2002. В ней ужасно всё - графика страшная, оптимизации нет (до сих пор лагает сука тварь мразь блядь), физика как в каких нибудь ЗАСРАНЦАХ ПРОТИВ ГАИ 2, то есть в ней нет ничего вообще за что мы любили серию флэтаут. В неё просто невозможно играть и любой адекватный человек конечно выключит её после первой гонки....а я вот прошёл все режимы и все гонки, получил все ачивки.... 

БLЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯТЬ!

Одна ачивка багнутая и не работает! СУКА! Да вы издеваетесь?!?!?!

На самом деле играть в это просто невозможно. Но у игры есть и плюс. Серьезно. И это креатив и разнообразие - реально в плане дизайна получилось всё неплохо, возможно у меня есть чувство, что это всё придумывал ктото другой и петухи из тим6 просто состряпали игру на основе чьих-то работ. Серьезно режимов много - гонки, дерби, монстртраки, убийство зомби, конечно бросание водителем в разные штуки. И если бы геймплей в игре был не на уровне МИНУС 9999 ТЫСЯЧ ИЗ ДЕСЯТИ - в это можно было бы играть. Идеи есть и они хорошие, а вот реализация...

Например теже бросания водителем прикольные - там есть целый набор уровней типа в аду где водилу можно спустить с лестницы или отправить прямо нахуй в преисподнюю, реально выглядит прикольно. И режим с зомби интересны. Или персонажи-гонщики - их много, они угарные и разные и легко бы вписались в нормальный флэтаут. Тоже самое и про машины - широкий разнообразный выбор, все очень разные, есть даже танк нахуй и двухэтажный автобус, тачки крутые и интересные, правда с местным графоном на них без слёз не глянешь конечно... но факт в том, что в этом всём я чувствую дух того самого флэтаута. Он есть! И если бы в игру можно было бы играть без физической боли, рискуя потерять год жизни за каждый час геймплея - было бы годно. Но...

Вот как теперь с этим жить то, а?","FUCK!

No, seriously...back when the game first came out, I was a fan of the series and started it up and turned it off after the first race. I was surprised, of course, but that was before my first review, and anyway, I wasn't really playing games back then, I was more of a student, so I didn't really pay attention. Now I've launched it and...

FUCKING F ... Of course, it's not hard to guess – the publisher decided to cash in on the brand and signed Team6, a studio that's been releasing two or three racing games a year for 20 years now, and has released such masterpieces as Taxi Racer London 2, Big City Racer, and Road Rage! The latter game, by the way, was released in 2017, and... it's still just as bad, even on PS4 – can you believe it? It's literally their studio policy to release absolute crap, and that's how it should be! I can already imagine the TEAM6 logo greeting you at the entrance to the studio's office – WE'VE BEEN PRODUCING THIS SHIT FOR 20 YEARS.

Oh well. Of course, let's wish death on everyone involved, because they deserve it – it takes a lot to ruin everyone's favorite racing game like that. Talent is needed – after all, they made the most downvoted game on Steam, meaning Flat Out 3 has the highest percentage of negative reviews. That's the interesting facts section. Achievement unlocked! Why make better games when there are so many of them? It's easy and not cool. Make the worst! Now that's a challenge, I think!

As for the game itself, it came out in 2010, but it looks and plays like it was in 2002. Everything about it is terrible – the graphics are terrible, there's no optimization (it still lags, you fucking bastard), the physics are like something out of ASSHOLES VS. GASI 2 – it's devoid of any of the things we loved about the Flat Out series. It's simply unplayable, and any sane person would certainly turn it off after the first race.... But I've completed all the modes and all the races, gotten all the achievements...

FUCKING F ... And if the gameplay weren't at the level of MINUS 9999 THOUSAND OUT OF TEN, it would be playable. The ideas are there, and they're good, but the execution...

For example, the driver-tossing is cool – there's a whole set of levels like Hell where you can throw the driver down a flight of stairs or send him straight to hell, it really looks cool. And the zombie mode is interesting. Or the racing characters – there are many of them, they're hilarious and diverse, and would easily fit into a normal flatout. The same goes for the cars – a wide variety of choices, all very different, there's even a fucking tank and a double-decker bus. The cars are cool and interesting, although with the local graphics, you can't look at them without tears, of course... but the fact is, I feel the spirit of that very Flatout in all of this.

Na flatoutech jsem vyrůstala. Byla to moje nejoblíbenější hra a mohla jsem ji hrát stále dokola a dokola. Dokonce mám doma účtenku z roku 2006 tehdejší krabicové verze. Takže když se mi naskytla šance získat další díl za dobrou cenu, neváhala jsem a hru si pořídila. Sice jsem slyšela, že to šlo celkem do kopru, ale říkala jsem jsou to Flatouti! No, měli jste vidět mé zděšení poté co jsem natěšeně hru poprvé spustila…

Hned po zapnutí mě zarazilo samotné menu hry. Nikde žádná kariéra, tedy žádné závodění, ničení v derby a vůbec prokousávání se postupně hrou, natož nějaké vylepšování aut. Jakože cože? To, na čem skoro celá hra stála tu není? Místo toho hra nabízí různé módy, které můžete hrát stále dokola. Ok, takže jsem zkusila mód Race a přišlo druhé zděšení, a to grafická stránka hry, která odpovídá cca roku 2003, tedy je příšerná. 

Co se týče samotného závodění fyzika aut velmi utrpěla. Jízdní model je hrozný. Auta jsou neohrabaná, dosahují nemožných rychlostí nebo příliš snadno vybuchují. Většinu času strávíte mimo cestu zaseklí o nějaký keříček, zatímco vybetonovanou zeď hravě prorazíte. Chování vašich protihráčů je absolutně nepředvídatelné, agresivní a hloupé. Pokud byste si chtěli normálně zazávodit, není to podle mě ani možné. 

I když Flatout je přeci i o ničení ne? No to by získávané škody, museli mít aspoň trochu nějakou logičnost. Poškození auta je totiž tak nějak náhodné. Přistanete s Monstertruckem na střeše vašeho protivníka a nic moc mu to neubere. Naopak když o vás lehce ťukne malé auto jste skoro zničení.

Celou tuhle katastrofu podkresluje stále se opakující, nervy drásající hudba. 

Suma sumárum, pokud jste fanoušky série Flatout, hru raději nezapínejte. Pokud o Flatoutech nic nevíte můžete se o to pokusit, ale ne nadarmo je tato hra nejhůře hodnocenou hrou na celém Steamu.

A co se vlastně stalo? Proč je Flatout najednou tak špatný? Odpovědí je změna studia. Za prvními velmi úspěšnými díly stálo studio Bugbear Entertainment. Poté však vývoj převzalo Team 6 Studios. No a výsledek je zde…
","[h1]Rating 0/10 , Achievements Completed 1 of 46 , [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34526713/]Curator[/url] [/h1]

I grew up on flatouts. It was my favorite game and I could play it over and over again. I even have a receipt at home from 2006 for the then boxed version. So when I got a chance to get the next installment at a good price, I didn't hesitate and bought the game. Although I heard that it went to hell, but I said it was the Flatouts! Well, you should have seen my dismay after I excitedly launched the game for the first time…

Right after turning it on, I was struck by the game's menu itself. No career anywhere, so no racing, destruction in derbies and even biting your way through the game, let alone any car upgrades. Like what? What almost the whole game was based on is not here? Instead, the game offers different modes that you can play over and over again. Ok, so I tried the Race mode and the second horror came, namely the graphic side of the game, which corresponds to about 2003, so it's horrible. 

As for the actual racing, the physics of the cars suffered a lot. The driving model is terrible. Cars are clunky, reach impossible speeds or explode too easily. You spend most of your time off the road getting stuck on a bush while you playfully break through a concrete wall. The behavior of your opponents is absolutely unpredictable, aggressive and stupid. If you wanted to race normally, I don't think it's even possible. 

Although Flatout is also about destruction, isn't it? Well, the damages obtained would have to have at least some logic. After all, the damage to the car is somehow random. You land the Monstertruck on your opponent's roof and it doesn't take much away from them. On the contrary, if a small car lightly touches you, you are almost destroyed.

This whole disaster is underscored by the constantly repeating, nerve-wracking music. 

All in all, if you're a fan of the Flatout series, don't play the game. If you don't know anything about Flatouts, you can try it, but it's not for nothing that this game is the lowest rated game on all of Steam.

And what actually happened? Why is Flatout so bad all of a sudden? The answer is a change of study. The studio Bugbear Entertainment was behind the first very successful works. However, development was then taken over by Team 6 Studios. And here is the result...

Moin Leute,
ich habe mich mal dazu entschlossen, ein Review zum 3. 
Ableger der legendären FlatOut-Reihe zu verfassen. Schon 
damals war ich ein großer Fan von FlatOut 2, welches sich 
ursprünglich durch ein für damalige Verhältnisse astreines 
Schadensmodell und gute Physics auszeichnete. Vor allem 
die Destruction-Derbies waren der Hit auf jeder LAN. 

Da ich Chaos & Destruction noch nicht zuvor gespielt habe 
und mir die durchaus negativen Reviews aufgefallen sind, 
habe ich mir mal das Spiel zum symbolischen Preis von 
0,99€ im Sale einverleibt, um mir ein eigenes Bild von dem 
Schmuckstück zu machen.

Im Hauptmenü wird man von  einer ""fabelhaften"" Musik
begrüßt. Als es dann ins Rennen ging, fiel mir sofort die 
schwammige Steuerung auf, wobei schwammig noch 
untertrieben ist. Die Physics und die KI sind leider auch 
nicht mehr das, was sie mal waren. Die Sounds für die 
Fahrer scheinen die Entwickler aus schlechten 
Amateurpornos genommen zu haben. 

Wiederum muss ich auch sagen, dass das Spiel  ganz 
lustig sein kann,  wenn die KI einfach mal schnurschtracks 
in die Wand ballert.

Alles in allem: Das Spiel ist im Gegensatz zu seinen 
Vorgängern der größte Mist und der Euro ist in anderen 
Billigspielen wesentlich besser investiert.

Hi guys,
I've decided to write a review of the third installment in the legendary FlatOut series. Even back then, I was a big fan of FlatOut 2, which originally featured a flawless damage model and good physics for the time. The Destruction Derbies, in particular, were a hit at every LAN.

Since I hadn't played Chaos & Destruction before
and noticed the rather negative reviews,
I decided to buy the game on sale for the symbolic price of
€0.99 to get my own impression of this gem.

In the main menu, you're greeted by ""fabulous"" music. When the race started, I immediately noticed the sloppy controls, although sloppy is an understatement. Unfortunately, the physics and AI aren't what they used to be either. The developers seem to have taken the driver sounds from bad amateur porn.

I have to say, though, that the game can be quite hilarious when the AI ​​just blasts straight into the wall.

All in all: Compared to its predecessors, the game is complete crap, and the money would be much better spent on other cheap games.

Жалко конечно, что так и не появилось достойного наследника после второй Flatout, ведь и Flatout 4 не лучше... Раньше разработчики пытались передать максимум реализма, сочные повреждения, приятная физика авто и другое, но 3-яя серия получилась до жути аркадная и скудноватая. (скорее смена разработчиков повлияла на результат)","Damn! This Flatout installment is too ridiculous, from the control physics to the fun modes. Yes, it's worse, but surprisingly, my eyes didn't bleed from the lighting. Flatout 3 is the monstrosity of the Flatout family, a seemingly low-budget project. It's a shame, of course, that there never was a worthy successor to Flatout 2, because Flatout 4 isn't any better... Previously, the developers tried to convey maximum realism, juicy damage, enjoyable car physics, and more, but the 3rd series turned out terribly arcadey and lackluster.

Когда брал комплит пак, я думал, что трёшку засрали олдфаги, которым сложно угодить. Я еще никогда так не ошибался. Сложно представить, как издатель доверил производство 3 части разрабам, у которых скорее получилось сделать дешевую порно-пародию на Burnout, приправленную нотками Carmageddon, а не продолжение годной серии.

Но названия гонок доставляют:

When I bought the complete pack, I thought the 3D game had been trashed by hard-to-please old-timers. I've never been so wrong. It's hard to imagine how the publisher entrusted the production of the 3D game to developers who were more likely to make a cheap porn parody of Burnout, spiced up with hints of Carmageddon, than a continuation of a decent series.

But the race titles are amazing:

Сегодня я хотел бы поговорить об одной части одной известной гоночной серии Flatout, которая получила очень плохие оценки как от игроков, так и от прессы. Заслужено? Сейчас расскажу.

Спойлер: Ещё как заслужено.

И начну, пожалуй, с того, что я люблю Flatout, особенно 1-ю часть. В ней идеально было практически все: Приятная картинка, физика поведения автомобилей, разрушаемость и потрясный саундтрек. Тоже самое было и во второй части: Всё хорошее взяли из оригинала и удвоили. В итоге игра получилась не хуже оригинала, и сама серия FlatOut стала культовой, что вполне заслужено, после выходит Ultimate Carnage, который является улучшенной версией 2-й части, который тоже был вполне хорош. Но вот потом вышла 3-я часть... Господи...

Картинка в игре просто отвратительна. После недолгого просмотра, моим глазам стало очень плохо и даже появлялось ощущение, что меня сейчас стошнит и это, блин, не шутка! Она настолько плоха, что тебе не верится, что это, чертов, 2011 год... и к тому же, вспоминая прошлые части Flatout, хочется только плакать. А какие там детализированные модельки людей… 2011 год… 11 год, Карл!

В это невозможно нормально играть. Мало того что физика, о ней чуть позже, ужасна, так ещё и сам геймплей не вызывает никаких положительных эмоций от слова совсем. Дерби - никчемные. Мало того, что боты в этой игре до жути тупые, так ещё только на тебя и лезут. Также, врезаясь в соперников, ты не чувствуешь какого-то адреналина, кайфа, чувство соперничества и т.д., как это было в прошлых частях; Зомби-режим - что это вообще такое? Это ""очень"" увлекательный режим, где вам надо сбивать стоячих зомби. Интересно, правда?; Гонки на формулах-1 - молниеносная хренотня где происходит непонятно что. О других режимах рассказывать смысла не вижу, так как они тупа такие же по интересности.

Ох, вот тут веселуха! Что говорите? В ТНЕ СГЕШ и последних NFS дно физика? Пффф... Кое-кто просто не играл или забыл какая физика у машин в Flatout 3! Серьезно, после этой игры начинаешь думать, что в THE СГЕШ и NFS физика просто сверхреалистичная и я, блин, опять не шучу. Машины ни черта не слушаются. Они порой скользят по дороге просто из-за ничего и что самое главное - машины управляются очень хреново. Ты просто не чувствуешь, что машина поворачивает, а ещё здесь нет ручника. Точнее, он есть, но его нет. Как это? А просто! Жмякаешь на кнопку ручника и машина вместо того чтобы резко оттормозиться, включает режим дрифта, то бишь начинает скользить еще сильнее, при этом скорость не падает. Это же гениально, блин!

Повреждения, как вы помните, а вы должны помнить, сказываются на поведение автомобиля и они (повреждения) были достаточно хорошо детализированы что в 1-м, что и во 2-м Flatout. Здесь же, повреждения вообще не играют роль. Они здесь для чисто визуального присутствия. Да, машину можно разбить, но чем меньше % прочности у авто, тем ничего не меняется у машины. Она у тебя как ехала под 250 и выше, так и будет. А как же они, блин, хреново детализированы... Flatout 1 и 2, мы все про*бали!

Как вы знаете, саундтрек должен играть одну из главных ролей что в фильме, что в игре. Ведь, благодаря нему, мы можем вспомнить где эта песня играла, а также саундтрек придает определенную атмосферу, настроение тому или иному проекту. В Flatout 3 музыка только в меню и только одна, да ещё и ужасно исполненная. Также хочу добавить про звуки: Они отвратительны - Разрушение объектов, столкновение с другими гонщиками, вспрыск нитро, рев авто. Все это записано было ужасно и ушам после услышанного становится

[h1]Итог[/h1]

Flatout 3 - это плохая игра, наверно, одна из самых худших в своем жанре, да какой там, одна из самых худших игр за всю историю игровой индустрии. Кто-то может сказать, что на меня подействовал синдром утенка, но это не так. Посмотрите какой был 2-й Flatout и какой был 1-й, а потом гляньте на 3-ю часть и всё станет ясно. Покупать не советую, да даже пиратить тоже. Эта игра недостойна как внимания, так и существования вовсе. Уж лучше поиграйте в первые две части, чем в это.","[h1][b]An underrated masterpiece?[/b][/h1]

Today I'd like to talk about a game in the well-known racing series, Flatout, which received very poor reviews from both players and the press. Deserved? I'll tell you now.

Spoiler: Absolutely deserved.

And I'll start by saying that I love Flatout, especially the first game. It had practically everything perfect: nice graphics, car physics, destructibility, and a stunning soundtrack. The same was true for the second game: they took everything good from the original and doubled it down. The end result is just as good as the original, and the FlatOut series itself has earned a cult following, which is well deserved. Then came Ultimate Carnage, which is an improved version of the second game, which was also quite good. But then came the third game... oh my God...

The graphics in the game are simply disgusting. After watching it for a short time, my eyes started hurting, and I even felt like I was going to puke, and this is no joke! It's so bad you can't believe it's 2011... and besides, remembering the previous Flatout games just makes me want to cry. And what detailed human models they had... 2011... 2011, Karl!

It's impossible to play this game properly. Not only are the physics (more on that later) terrible, but the gameplay itself is completely unimpressive. The demolition derbies are useless. Not only are the bots in this game terribly stupid, but they only ever attack you. Also, when you crash into opponents, you don't feel the adrenaline, the thrill, the sense of competition, etc., like you did in the previous games; what is Zombie mode anyway? This is a ""very"" exciting mode where you have to run over stationary zombies. Interesting, right? Formula 1 racing is lightning-fast crap where who knows what's going on. I don't see the point in talking about the other modes, since they're just as interesting.

Oh, this is fun! What are you saying? The physics in THE SGESH and the latest NFS are rubbish? Pfft... Some people just haven't played it or have forgotten what the car physics are like in Flatout 3! Seriously, after playing this game, you start to think that the physics in THE SGESH and NFS are just super-realistic, and I'm not kidding again. The cars don't respond at all. They sometimes slide along the road for no apparent reason, and most importantly, the cars handle incredibly poorly. You just don't feel like the car is turning, and there's no handbrake. Or rather, there is one, but it's not there. How can that be? Simple! You press the handbrake button, and instead of braking abruptly, the car engages drift mode, meaning it starts sliding even harder without losing speed. It's fucking genius!

Damage, as you remember—and you should remember—affects the car's performance, and it (damage) was quite well detailed in both Flatout 1 and 2. Here, however, damage plays no role at all. It's there purely for visual effect. Yes, a car can be wrecked, but the lower the car's hit points, the less it changes. It'll stay that way, driving at 250 or more. And how about that, damn, the detail is so lousy... Flatout 1 and 2, we screwed everything up!

As you know, the soundtrack should play a major role in both a film and a game. After all, thanks to it, we can remember where a particular song was played, and the soundtrack also creates a certain atmosphere and mood for a particular project. In Flatout 3, the only music is in the menu, and only one, and it's terribly performed. I also want to add about the sounds: They're disgusting – the destruction of objects, collisions with other racers, the nitro squirt, the roar of the car. All of this was recorded terribly, and after hearing it, your ears become...

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

Flatout 3 is a bad game, probably one of the worst in its genre, and, what's more, one of the worst games in the history of the gaming industry. Some might say I'm suffering from the duckling syndrome, but that's not true. Look at Flatout 2 and Flatout 1, and then look at Part 3, and everything will become clear. I don't recommend buying it, or even pirating it. This game is unworthy of attention, or even of its existence. It's better to play the first two parts than this one."

Многие обзоры на эту игру останавливаются на ""ыыы игра гхомно"" и ничего конкретного, почему именно они так считают?
Стоило некоторым топовым изданиям поставить оценку ниже 50, и тут же набежали школьники со стадным инстинктом которые и часу не наиграли в игру и закидали камнями FlatOut 3, и при всём этом они не могут объяснить с чем связан весь хейт, ну или олды которые не хотят принимать что то новое в серии игр. 
И какие же плюсы у этой игры, спросите вы, я же отвечу: 
+ Множество режимов (от гонок на болидах формулы 1 до покатушек на машинах монстах, так что каждый найдет что то свое)
+ Богатый автопарк (очень много машин и в каждом режиме они разные)
+ Сочные разрушения автомобилей (камон это ж FlatOut)
+ Большие трассы (некоторые трассы и в правду очень большие, но не все) 
А чё там по минусам? Все минусы которые я заметил на протяжении игры это:
- Пара багов (но а в какой игре их нет?)
- Очень странный подсчёт процента урона (иногда врезаешься на полной скорости в тачку а процент урона всего то 3%)
Ну вот все минусы которые я заметил, да кто то скажет что графика плохая, а мы играем только ради графики или ради геймплея?","I honestly don't understand why everyone hates this game so much.
Many reviews of this game stop short of ""ugh, this game sucks"" without any specifics. Why exactly do they think that?
As soon as some top publications gave it a rating below 50, a bunch of schoolchildren with a herd instinct who haven't even played the game for an hour immediately rushed in and started pelting FlatOut 3 with rocks. They can't explain all the hate, or they're just old-timers who don't want to accept anything new in the series.
So what are the pros of this game, you ask? I'll answer:

+ Lots of modes (from Formula 1 racing to monster truck driving, so there's something for everyone)
+ Extensive car fleet (lots of cars, and each mode has its own unique style)
+ Juicy car destruction (come on, it's FlatOut)
+ Large tracks (some tracks are truly huge, but not all)

And what about the cons? The only cons I noticed while playing were:
- A couple of bugs (but what game doesn't have those?)
- Very strange damage percentage calculation (sometimes you crash into a car at full speed, and the damage percentage is only 3%)
Well, those are all the cons I noticed. Some might say the graphics are bad, but do we play just for the graphics or the gameplay?"

Od genialnej jedynki aż do średniawej czwórki.Na tą część nie trafiłem przypadkowo i jako fan serii kupiłem tę,,grę''
Co poszło nie tak ? Tego dowiecie się za chwilę.

FlatOut 3:Chaos i Destruction -To trzecia pełnoprawna część brutalnej serii gier wyścigowych zapoczątkowanej w 2004 roku
przez Fińskie studio Bugbear entertainment. Teraz pewnie interesujecie się czemu deweloperem tej części nie jest Bugbear ale
debilne studio które ma na własnym koncie same shity czyli TEAM 6.Krótko to ujmując Empire Interactive czyli studio które
wydawało FLATOUTA: 1,2 oraz UC.Upadło po licznych zwoleniach i problemach finansowych w maju 2009roku.
Prawa do FlatOuta nadano firmie Strategy First która popełniła najgłupszy błąd w historii... Nadała FlatOuta w łapska
TEAM 6 co przyczyniło do powstania tego nowotwora w 2011 roku.
MODEL JAZDY: Na pierwszy ogień idzie model jazdy czyli chyba najwazniejsza rzecz w grze wyścigowej.
Który we FlatOut 3 jest do dupy. Naszym kartonowym wozem jedzie się jak po lodzie.Samochód ma bardzo dużą przyczepność po czym wydaje dość czujne skręty.Teraz ja się pytam:GDZIE JEST ARCADOWY MODEL JAZDY?!?!
Takiej przyczepnośći do powierzchni niewidziałem już od czasów BIG RIGS. OCH SZKODA GADAĆ.
TRYBY ROZGRYWKI: Jest ich dosyć dużo ale niema co tu dużo mówić. Mamy tu takie tryby jak RACE czyli normalny wysćig.
Stuntman :Zawody kaskaderskie w których trzeba naszego wspaniałego gościa wystrzelić w dane miejsce używając przycisku lewego shiftu.
Monster truck i Off road: Na sam początek myślałem że te tryby będą ciekawe jeżeli jeżdzimy wielkimi maszynami ale niestety myliłem się. Jeżdzi się nimi jak jajecznica na smażącej się patelni.
Innych trybów już nie zrecenzuje bo one nie mają i tak większego sensu.
GRAFIKA: Czyli rozwój wstecz w porównaniu do poprzednich części gdzie UC wymiatało pod tym względem.
Mimo że mamy dużo opcji graficznych to gra nadal wygląda jak gówno słonia.
SZTUCZNA INTELIGENCJA: Ostatni punkt który zrecenzuje czyli SI. Pamiętacie jak w pierwszym FlatOucie przeciewnicy reagowali na sytuację jaka była na torze? Tutaj jest owiele inaczej .Nasi nieprzyjaciele jak zablokujemy im drogę to stoją jak
pachołki . omg.
Chętnie bym opisał jeszcze inne tryby czyli arena,big battle .splatout oraz kilka innych ale ta gra jest taka niedopracowana że szkoda gadać.To samo tyczy się modelu zniszczeń który też jest kiczowy. Po uderzeniu w krzaki nasz wóz się rozpada.A uderzenie w przeciewnika kończy się tak że my tracimy więcej obrażeń niż wróg to woła o pomstę do nieba.

Podsumując: FlatOut 3: chaos i destruction to shit jakich mało. BUGI oraz problemy z optymalizacją można jeszcze brzebolec.  Ta gra idealnie pokazuje dla fanów serii jak i niefanów jak można zniszczyć wspaniały cykl.
Team 6 powinno zap******** na galerze za zniszczenie serii jak i obrażanie graczy o posiadanie wersji pirackich.Też nie moge pojąć jak mozna powiedziec że MW3 jest beta a aktualizacje dodają więcej błędów.Po przegraniu tego shitu widać ze jest na odwrót .Nie polecam kupywać tego nawet na przecenie.Nie bierzcie tego nawet za darmo.MIMO to FlatOut 4 od KYLOTOON jest owiele lepszy od tego czegoś ale i tak nie dorównuje temu co zrobiło Bugbear . To wystarczy poczekać na FlatOuta 5...

FlatOut od bugbear RZADZI.","Let's start by saying that I'm a huge fan of the FLATOUT racing game series and own all the installments.
From the brilliant first one to the mediocre fourth. I didn't stumble upon this installment by accident, and as a fan of the series, I bought this ""game.""
What went wrong? You'll find out in a moment.

FlatOut 3: Chaos and Destruction - This is the third full-fledged installment in the brutal racing game series launched in 2004 by the Finnish studio Bugbear Entertainment. Now you're probably wondering why this installment wasn't developed by Bugbear, but by a retarded studio with nothing but crap under its belt, TEAM 6. In short, Empire Interactive, the studio that published FLATOUT 1, 2, and UC, went bankrupt after numerous layoffs and financial problems in May 2009. The rights to FlatOut were assigned to Strategy First, which made the stupidest mistake in history... They handed FlatOut over to TEAM 6, which contributed to the development of this cancer in 2011.
DRIVING MODEL: First up is the driving model, which is probably the most important thing in a racing game.
Which in FlatOut 3 is crap. Our cardboard car drives like it's on ice. The car has a lot of grip and makes quite sensitive turns. Now I ask: WHERE IS THE ARCAD DRIVING MODEL?!?!
I haven't seen grip like this since BIG RIGS. OH, IT'S SUFFICIENT TO TALK ABOUT IT.
GAME MODES: There are quite a few, but there's not much to say. We have modes like RACE, which is a normal race. Stuntman: A stunt competition where you have to launch our great guy into a specific spot using the left shift button.
Monster truck and Off-road: At first, I thought these modes would be interesting if we were driving huge machines, but unfortunately, I was wrong. They're like scrambled eggs in a frying pan.
I won't review the other modes because they don't make much sense anyway.
GRAPHICS: This represents a step backward compared to previous installments, where UC was brilliant in this regard.
Even though we have many graphical options, the game still looks like elephant dung.
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: The last thing I'll review is the AI. Remember how in the first FlatOut, enemies reacted to the situation on the track? It's much different here. When we block their path, our enemies stand there like cones. Omg. I'd love to describe other modes, like Arena, Big Battle, Splatout, and a few others, but this game is so underdeveloped it's not even worth mentioning. The same goes for the destruction model, which is also cheesy. After hitting a bush, your car falls apart. And hitting an enemy results in you taking more damage than the enemy – that's a shame.

In summary: FlatOut 3: chaos and destruction is utter crap. Bugs and optimization issues are a dime a dozen. This game perfectly demonstrates for fans and non-fans alike how a great series can be destroyed. Team 6 should be thrown in the trash heap for ruining the series and insulting players for having pirated versions. I also don't understand how anyone can say that MW3 is a beta and updates add more bugs. After playing this crap, it's clear that it's the other way around. I don't recommend buying it, even on sale. Don't even get it for free. Despite this, FlatOut 4 by KYLOTOON is much better than this thing, but it still doesn't compare to what Bugbear has done. Just wait for FlatOut 5...
Okay, time for the rating:
Graphics: 2/10
Playability: 1/10
Audio: 0/10
Specific rating: 2/10

Samochody to klocki z upośledzonym modelem zniszczeń w brzydkiej oprawie audiowizualnej i słabej optymalizacji...

[h1] FABUŁA [/h1]
[i]Śpijcie spokojnie, zestawienie bez większych spoilerów![/i]
Fabuły we [b]FlatOut 3: Chaos & Destruction[/b] nijako nie ma. Ot wcielamy się w mężczyznę bądź kobietę, nadajemy jej pseudonim i zostajemy wrzuceni w wir wyścigów samochodowych w kilku rodzajach. Przeciwnicy, mimo że są sztuczną inteligencją, podczas wyścigów „pokazują”, że mają swoje osobowości, a przynajmniej jakiś jej zalążek. I w tej kwestii to wszystko — tak jak w poprzednich częściach.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1646649566
[h1] MECHANIKA/ROZGRYWKA [/h1]
Team 6 Studios przygotowało pokaźną liczbę trybów rozgrywki: klasyczne wyścigi, pokazy kaskaderskie, derby, off-roady, wyścigi bolidów F1, czy zmagania monster trucków. Problem jest w tym, że zapomnieli o głównym trybie — karierze — do której seria nas przyzwyczaiła i który był motorem napędowym rozgrywki, pozwalającym nam spędzić w grze parę dobrych godzin i powalczyć o puchar. No ale dobra… Każdy z trybów ma przygotowany odmienny zestaw pojazdów o różnych osiągnięciach, takich jak prędkość, przyspieszenie, wytrzymałość czy mobilność. Samochodów jest naprawdę sporo, a każdy z nich może przejść lekki tuning. Naprawdę lekki — nie ma tutaj systemu zarobków, a sam system ulepszeń opiera się na dowolnym przełączeniu jednego guziczka — poza tym, nie czuć, by ten oddziaływał jakoś na mechanikę jazdy. Twórcy przygotowali też różnorodne, niepowtarzające się trasy i areny, które są jednak... nudne.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1646650674
To samo można zarzucić całej rozgrywce — jest cholernie nudna. Może i w zwyczajnych wyścigach dzieje się wiele, ale tylko na samym początku, przed startem, bo gdy przebijemy się przez ten żargon bezmózgich kierowców mających za cel zniszczenie nas (a nie dojechanie na metę), zupełnie nic się nie dzieje.

Najgorsze jednak co Team 6 Studios zrobiło, to zniszczenie całej tej intuicyjności sterowania pojazdem i pracy kamery. Sterowność samochodów jest fatalna i czuć, jakby było się na wyścigach kartonów bez kółek, a poczucie prędkości (niezależne czy z nitrem, czy bez) to rzecz nieistniejąca. Licznik to chora animacja dodana tylko po to, aby było, gdyż prędkość jaką pokazuje niczego nie odwzorowuje. Pomarzyć można o takich rzeczach jak drift, poślizg, czy choćby fizyka siły dośrodkowej. Tylko niech mi nikt nie mówi, że na tym polegają gry wyścigowe typu arcade! Jasne, w tego typu produkcjach sterowność nie jest realistyczna, ale istnieje w przeciwieństwie do tego, co mamy we [b]FlatOut 3: Chaos & Destruction[/b]. I tak, można to zrobić dobrze — wystarczy spojrzeć na FlatOut 1, czy FlatOut 2.

[h1] OPRAWA GRAFICZNA [/h1]
Kolejny element, o który Team 6 Studios nie zadbało — oprawa graficzna. [b]FlatOut 3: Chaos & Destruction[/b] prezentuje się okropnie, a jakby i tego było mało, optymalizacja jest do bani. Tekstury nie posiadają szczegółów, są rozmazane i mdłe — jest to co najwyżej średnia jakość. Mamy też doczynienia z kiepskimi efektami, przy których produkcja potrafi tracić płynność, a nawet się przycinać. Przy tym, co dostajemy śmiesznie, wyglądają wymagania sprzętowe, które może teraz nie robią jakieś większej różnicy, ale w dniu premiery tytuł wymagał za wiele.

Team 6 Studios nie zostawiło nic z modelu zniszczeń poprzednich części, którym to seria biła rekordy...
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1646649742
[h1] UDŹWIĘKOWIENIE/MUZYKA [/h1]
Wiecie, że we [b]FlatOut 3: Chaos & Destruction[/b] nie ma ścieżki dźwiękowej? Dokładnie tak. Kolejny element, który idealnie budował klimat arcadowych wyścigów w poprzednich częściach, tutaj nie występuje w ogóle. Kiedy więc nie słyszymy muzyki, nasze zmysły będą się bardziej skupiały na innych dźwiękach, takich jak warkot silnika, zderzenia, czy wybuchy. O ile miło czasami sobie tego posłuchać, tak wysłuchiwanie tego na okrągło, bez przerwy zwyczajnie męczy.

[h1] PODSUMOWANIE [/h1]
[b]FlatOut 3: Chaos & Destruction[/b] to czarna owca serii. To produkcja, przy której już po uruchomieniu zadajesz sobie pytanie: „co ja najlepszego zrobiłem?!” — mając w pamięci te kilkadziesiąt wydanych złotych. Seria FlatOut jest cholernie bliska mojemu sercu, dlatego nie mogę zrozumieć, jak okryte złą sławą Team 6 Studios zyskało do niej prawa. Deweloperzy bez krycia się napluli nam w twarz, wydając produkcje wyglądającą jak wczesna wersja alfa i jeszcze przy tym twierdząc, że pierwszy raz w historii stworzyli produkt tak mocno otwarty na sugestie konsumentów. Oczywiście nikomu produkcji nie polecam. No, chyba że chcecie doświadczyć masochistycznych doznań...

This time, the problem turned out to be the developers of the Wii port of the previous FlatOut games, and that fact alone was a sign that something could go wrong. All the good elements from the previous installments are gone, replaced by oddities. Cars are bricks with a flawed damage model, ugly audiovisuals, and poor optimization...

[h1] STORY[/h1]
[i]Rest easy, this summary is spoiler-free![/i]
There's no plot in [b]FlatOut 3: Chaos & Destruction[/b]. You simply take on the role of a man or a woman, assign them a nickname, and are thrown into a whirlwind of car races of several types. Despite being artificial intelligence, opponents ""show"" their own personalities during the races, or at least some hint of one. And that's it in this regard—just like in previous installments.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1646649566
[h1] MECHANICS/GAMEPLAY[/h1]
Team 6 Studios has prepared a considerable number of game modes: classic races, stunt shows, derbies, off-road races, F1 races, and monster truck competitions. The problem is that they've forgotten the main mode—career—that the series has accustomed us to and which was the driving force of the gameplay, allowing us to spend a good few hours playing and compete for the trophy. But oh well... Each mode features a different set of vehicles with different characteristics, such as speed, acceleration, durability, and mobility. There are a lot of cars, and each of them can be slightly tuned. It's really light – there's no earning system, and the upgrade system itself is based on the flick of a single button – other than that, it doesn't feel like it affects the driving mechanics in any way. The developers also created a variety of unique tracks and arenas, which are... boring.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1646650674
The same could be said about the gameplay itself – it's incredibly boring. There might be a lot going on in regular races, but only at the very beginning, before the start, because once you get past the jargon of mindless drivers intent on destroying you (not reaching the finish line), absolutely nothing happens.

The worst thing Team 6 Studios has done, however, is destroy the intuitiveness of the vehicle controls and camera work. The car's handling is terrible, making you feel like you're racing cardboard without wheels, and the sense of speed (regardless of whether you're using nitro boost or not) is nonexistent. The speedometer is a sick animation added just for the sake of it, as the speed it displays doesn't actually represent anything. You can only dream of things like drifting, skidding, or even centripetal force physics. Just don't tell me that's what arcade racing games are all about! Sure, the handling isn't realistic in these types of games, but it exists, unlike what we have in [b]FlatOut 3: Chaos & Destruction[/b]. And yes, it can be done well—just look at FlatOut 1 or FlatOut 2.

[h1] GRAPHICS [/h1]
Another element that Team 6 Studios neglected to address—the graphics. [b]FlatOut 3: Chaos & Destruction[/b] looks terrible, and as if that weren't enough, the optimization is terrible. The textures lack detail, are blurry, and bland—average quality at best. We're also dealing with poor effects, which can cause the game to stutter and even stutter. Compared to what we get, the system requirements seem ridiculous. While they might not make much difference now, the game was demanding too much at launch.

Team 6 Studios has left nothing of the destruction model from previous installments, which set records for the series...
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1646649742
[h1] SOUNDTRACK/MUSIC[/h1]
Did you know that [b]FlatOut 3: Chaos & Destruction[/b] doesn't have a soundtrack? Exactly. Another element that perfectly built the atmosphere of arcade racing in previous installments is absent here. So, when we don't hear music, our senses will focus more on other sounds, such as the roar of engines, collisions, or explosions. While it's sometimes pleasant to listen to, listening to it over and over again is simply tiring.

[h1] SUMMARY [/h1]
[b]FlatOut 3: Chaos & Destruction[/b] is the series' black sheep. It's a game that, as soon as you start it, makes you wonder, ""What have I done best?!""—remembering those few dozen zlotys spent. The FlatOut series is incredibly close to my heart, so I can't understand how the infamous Team 6 Studios acquired the rights to it. The developers blatantly spit in our faces, releasing a game that looks like an early alpha version and claiming that for the first time in history, they've created a product so open to consumer suggestions. Of course, I don't recommend this game to anyone. Well, unless you want to experience masochistic sensations...

- El coche no vuela o planea (como lo quieras llamar), por algún extraño motivo el coche se adhiere todo el rato al suelo, supongo que esto es un bug, pero vamos, es un bug que podrian haber aprovechado para hacer mapas chulos para correr por las paredes y techo, pero no.
-No se el efecto ese que le quieren dar como de ""velocidad"" emborronando el marco de la pantalla, es horrible y me crea ansiedad verlo.
-PUEDES EDITAR MUY HEAVY LAS CARRERAS, que basicamente puedes poner 1 vuelta, que sea de x manera y tal, es horrible.
-La banda sonora bueno... me he pasado el juego muteado asi que no podria decir.
-El juego aun que vaya a 120 fps se nota super laggado, como mal hecho como si el motor grafico estubiese desincronizado con lo que muestra no se como explicarlo, es muy raro.
- Crashes varios, una putada sinceramente.

Pero lo dicho no todo es malo, tiene muchos modos de juego que para la gente que busca variedad les puede gustar, en mi caso busco carreras asi que no.

Pues no lo recomiendo tristemente.

Nota : 4/10","Well, Flatout 3 is bad, but it's not Flatout either. It gets its name because it ""sells,"" but it really could have been a perfectly different game. It doesn't focus as much on racing as the first two. This one, however, has more game modes, much more fun than the previous installments. The problem comes when...
- The car doesn't fly or glide (whatever you want to call it). For some strange reason, the car sticks to the ground all the time. I suppose this is a bug, but anyway, it's a bug they could have taken advantage of to make cool maps to run on walls and ceilings, but no.
- I don't know what that ""speed"" effect they're trying to give it by blurring the screen frame is horrible and makes me anxious watching it.
- YOU CAN EDIT THE RACES VERY HEAVY, basically you can put 1 lap, have it be x way and such, it's horrible.
- The soundtrack, well... I played the game muted so I couldn't say.
-Even when running at 120 fps, the game feels incredibly laggy, as if it's poorly made, as if the graphics engine were out of sync with what it's displaying. I don't know how to explain it, it's really weird.
- Various crashes, honestly a pain.

But that said, it's not all bad. It has many game modes that people looking for variety might like. In my case, I'm looking for races, so no.

Well, I don't recommend it, sadly.

Vi as análises negativas, mas não imaginava que o jogo fosse tão ruim ao ponto de não conseguir terminar uma partida. 

Esse jogo não merece ser chamado de ""Flatout"", já que isso não parece nada com os jogos da franquia, que por sinal, são mt bons.

Uma dica que posso dar aos futuros compradores (Que eu sinceramente espero que não hajam mais compradores), é que não comprem isso, gastem o seu dinheiro em alguma coisa que preste.

Motivo  dessa análise extremamente negativa:

Física: Física? Que isso? Nunca nem vi. Pra que serve isso?
Jogabilidade: ""Parece que você está guiando um tanque de guerra à 200km/h, de tão pesado""
Gráficos: Extremamente ultrapassados para a época em que o jogo foi lançado, fora que achei o jogo meio borrado.
Desempenho: Um lixo, não sei como descrever o desempenho com outras palavras a não ser esta

Resumo geral sobre o que acho sobre o jogo: Uma perda de tempo","Honestly, I have no words to describe this garbage!

I saw the negative reviews, but I never imagined the game would be so bad that I couldn't even finish a game.

This game doesn't deserve to be called ""Flatout,"" as it doesn't sound anything like the games in the franchise, which, by the way, are very good.

One tip I can give to future buyers (I sincerely hope there won't be any more buyers) is to not buy this, spend your money on something worthwhile.

Reason for this extremely negative review:

Physics: Physics? What's that? I've never even seen it. What's the point?
Gameplay: ""It feels like you're driving a tank at 200 km/h, it's so heavy.""
Graphics: Extremely outdated for the time the game was released, and I found the game a bit blurry. Performance: Trash, I don't know how to describe the performance other than this.

Overall summary of my thoughts on the game: A waste of time."

Плюси:
-Непогана впринципі графіка(якби не фізика гри, то взагалі б норм було)
-Багато цікавих карт, досить непогано пророблених
-Величезна кількість режимів як для гри,впринціпі тут все добре, цікаво точно буде!
-Цікаві та неодинарні гонщики.
Мінуси:
-Фізика(грати складно, непривично, але водночас цікаво, щось в цьому таки є)
-Саунтрек ( взагалі нічого тут доброго сказати не можу, скучно, банально,нецікаво)
-Онлайну взагалі немає
Одним словом по скидці точно вартує брати,ігра дешева, пограти поп приколу можна, навіть по кайфу.","To finish the nasty game for your own money, it’s definitely not possible to perceive this game as a sequel to Flatout2, Dark Souls fans will definitely appreciate this race!
Pros:
-The graphics are bad in principle (if it weren’t physics, then it would have been normal)
-Lots of cards, too many bad ones to spill
-The number of modes is great for games, in principle everything is fine here, it will definitely work!
-Tsikavy and extraordinary racers.
Disadvantages:
-Physics (it’s easy, it’s unusual, it’s not so bad at the moment, what’s the point)
-Soundtrack (I can’t say anything good here, it’s boring, banal, not good)
- There is no online chatter
In a word, it's definitely a discount, brothers, the game is cheap, you can play for fun, and enjoy it."

Tato recenze se bude dělit na 3 skupiny :
1. skupina : Né až tak hru ničící problémy
2. skupina : Horší problémy
3. skupina : Největší sra@ky které jsem našel při hraní




Prvky 1. skupiny : 
Hnusný menu art (tohle opravdu někdo dělal v malování), Hnusné ikony (rozlišení ikony, které bylo roztaženo na rozlišení 500x500), celkový vzhled hry (který mi spíš připomínal že jezdím autem ve Fallout 4 a ne FlatOutu), dementní výběr postav  (Eva Mentoz mluví za vše), multiplayer (ten už stejně nikdo nehraje)



Prvky 2. skupiny :
Ovladatelnost aut (to je jak jezdit na kečupu s kolama z betonu, prostě děs), Odolnost vozidla (která není nikde specifikovaná a pořád se mi stávalo, že jsem najednou měl 3% odolnosti vozu a potom co jsem naboural, mi to napsalo, že mám 68%), Soundtrack (1 minutové třískání s kytarou o zem udělané ve smyčce), Doba vozidla ve vzduchu (jedu 300 km/h a když vyskočím auto je během půl sekundy zpět na zemi), Odolnost vozidel protivníků (v rychlosti 240 km/h při nabourání uberu protivníkovi 2% života ??? hlavně že když oni ťuknou do vás, tak jste automaticky v prd@li).<------- toto jsou ovšem chyby které se dají v pohodě opravit jediným patchem, který od roku 2011 nevyšel.



Prvky 3. skupiny :
Fyzika hry (to slovo v téhle hře neexistuje), obtížnost AI (nezájem že nic neděláš, nezájem jakej mód hraješ, vždycky půjdou všichni jen do tebe), rychlost aut (silně pochybuju že Pontiac z 50. let 20. století, má zrychlení z nuly na 100 za 0.85 vteřiny), zombie mód (u kterého je víc bugů než délka tratě v decimetrech), monster trucky (které vydrží přesně jedno nabourání do zdi o rychlosti 60 km/h), optimalizace hry ( hra jede v pohodě a najednou se tlačítko restartovat závod promění, na tlačítko zaseknout hru a celej PC s ní),(dodatek že hraju na Windows 7, které vyšly 2 roky před hrou a na počítači, který má lepší specifikace než doporučené u hry)




Klady : (opravdu nějaké jsou)
Design aut (některá se podobají realným, jako například již dříve zmíněný Pontiac)
Nitro (to aspoň něco dělá, ale připadá mi že je ho tam zbytečně moc)





Shrnutí : 3.2/10
Hra je opravdu strašná a názor se mi změnit nepodařilo.","As a huge FlatOut fan, I've played all the games since I was a kid, except for this one. I knew that the reviews were very negative, so I bought the game at a discount because I might change my mind while playing, but it didn't work out.

This review will be divided into 3 groups:
Group 1 : Not so much game-breaking problems
2nd group: Worse problems
3rd group : The biggest shits I found while playing




Elements of the 1st group: 
Ugly menu art (someone really did this in painting), Ugly icons (icon resolution stretched to 500x500 resolution), overall appearance of the game (which reminded me more of driving a car in Fallout 4 and not FlatOut), demented character selection (Eva Mentoz speaks for everything), multiplayer (nobody plays it anymore anyway)



Elements of the 2nd group:
Handling of cars (it's like driving on ketchup with concrete wheels, just scary), Vehicle durability (which is not specified anywhere and it kept happening to me that I suddenly had 3% of the car's durability and after I crashed it said I had 68%), Soundtrack (1 minute of guitar smashing on the ground done in a loop), Vehicle time in the air (I drive 300 km/h and when I jump the car is back on the ground within half a second), Resistance of the opponents' vehicles (at a speed of 240 km/h when crashing, I take away 2% of the opponent's life ??? mainly because if they hit you, you are automatically fucked).



Elements of the 3rd group:
Game physics (that word doesn't exist in this game), AI difficulty (I don't care if you don't do anything, I don't care what mode you play, everyone will always go for you), car speed (I highly doubt that a Pontiac from the 1950s can go from zero to 100 in 0.85 seconds), zombie mode (which has more bugs than the length of the track in decimeters), monster trucks (which can withstand exactly one crash into a wall at the speed 60 km/h), optimization of the game (the game runs fine and suddenly the button to restart the race turns into a button to freeze the game and the whole PC with it), (addition that I am playing on Windows 7, which was released 2 years before the game and on a computer that has better specifications than recommended for the game)




Pros: (there really are some)
Car design (some look like the real thing, such as the previously mentioned Pontiac)
Nitro (at least it does something, but it seems to me that there is too much of it unnecessarily)





Summary : 3.2/10
The game is really terrible and I couldn't change my mind."

no tiene nada de bueno, si lo jugué 30 minutos ya es muchisimo, es lo peor de lo peor, la conduccion es malisima, se colea exageradamente de un lado a otro generando una perdida de control absoluta del vehiculo, si logras ir en linea recta por 1 minutos ya es un gran logro. ya que es imposible ir recto.

There's nothing good about it. If I played it for 30 minutes, that's already a lot. It's the worst of the worst. The handling is terrible, it jerks excessively from one side to the other, causing a complete loss of control of the vehicle. If you can manage to go in a straight line for 1 minute, it's already a great achievement, since it's impossible to go straight.

I only bought it because it came in the bundle. I was really only interested in FO Ultimate Carnage, FO4, and FlatOut. That alone made it worth the purchase. But don't buy it individually; it's not worth it, even with a discount."

Velké mínus je to,že tu není kariéra,ale jsou tu nové mody,které mě natchli..... SplatOut,ve kterém přejíždíte v časovém limitu zombie a Závodní okruh,ve kterém jedete ve formuli závodní okruh ( Just like fairplay xD).. Nedostatkem hry je grafika,což je ten nejmenší problém. Horší to ovšem je s tím,že při závodu není soundtrack,takže doporučuji pouštět Spotify s nějákou tvrdší hudbou,nebo s čímkoliv,co máte rádi.


+Originální nové mody
+Stále zábavné
+destrukce

Verdikt:  6/10","Flatout 3 doesn't quite resemble FlatOut, but it's still quite fun and everyone will find a mod that they like.

The big minus is that there is no career, but there are new mods that got me excited..... SplatOut, in which you drive within the time limit of zombies and Racing circuit, in which you drive in a formula racing circuit (Just like fairplay xD).. The lack of the game is the graphics, which is the least problem. It is worse, however, that there is no soundtrack during the race, so I recommend playing Spotify with some harder music, or whatever you like.

[list]
[*]• Destrukce vozů tu je, [b]ALE[/b] je propracovaná stejně jako rodiné balení lubrikačního gelu (což doufám neexistuje)
[*]• Destrukce prostředí tu je, [b]ALE[/b] těch věcí co ničit je málo a kvalita zpracování je stejná jako když váříte podle kuchařky Ládi Hrušky
[*]• Spousta nových módů a možností hraní (Zombie, monstertrucky, formule...), [b]ALE[/b] tento potenciál tvůrci dokonale zabili vlastně vším (u záporů to sepíšu)

[tr][td][b][u]Zápory:[/u][/b]
[list]
[*]• Fyzika - to je pro tuto hru stejně cizí slovo jako když před váma řeknu ""infinitizimální""
[*]• Soundtrack - Ale počkat. Ono tu něco takové vůbec je?
[*]• Grafika - Je otřesná, nedá se to říct jinak. (Podle mě stejná nebo dokonce horší než ve FlatOut 1) Jinými slovy pokud hledáte hru na kalkulačku tak jenom do toho.
[*]• Optimalizace - Ta je nesnesitelná. Hra se občas zasekne a občas má poklesy FPS a to i se silnou výbavou
[*]• Na co jsou tu atributy jako síla auta, rychlost či zrychlení, když všechna auta jezdí téměř totožně
[*]• Tuning - Vážně je i tohle v záporu? (Pokud mě znáte tak víte, že u recenze na jiný díl FlatOut jsem psal, že tuning je přece vždy pozitivní - jo přesně tak - takže není). Nemá ani žádnou cenu jen si nějaký vyberete před závodem.
[*]• Nastavení obtížnosti AI - To snad vůbec nic nedělá, tak na co to tu je?...
[*]• Nastavení počtu AI - Pochopil bych tuto možnost, kdyby hra byla dobrá, jenže není.
[*]• Hra vypadá lacině (Teda když říkám vypadá, tak je)
[*]• Naráz do soupeře vás prostě zpomalí/zastaví, on vypadá stejně, vy vypadáte stejně a jedete dál
[*]• Nové módy by mohly být fajn, ale na co když s formulí stejně můžete bez zpomalení jezdit i po trávě a písku. A co je do háje ten mód s Monstertruckama? Do teď jsem to nepochopil a vzhledem k tomu, že všichni soupeři (AI) měli taky 0 bodů tak oni taky ne.
[*]• Demoliční derby - Já už nevím co bych měl říkat - Ty derby tady trvají tak dlouho a jsou tak nudné. že jsem je vlastně ani jednou nedohrál.
[*]• Jména jezdců - Jelikož jsem je hodnotil i ve 4. dílu tak tady už můžu asi cokoliv. Eva Mentoz? Pan Maskovaný? Max Speed? Nebo dokonce [b]Jan Benzín[/b]??
[*]• Destrukce vozů - Zbytek je dopsaný v kladech
[*]• Destrukce prostředí - Zbytek opět dopsaný v kladech 
[*]• Znovuhratelnost - je nulová, to se nedá říct jinak
[*]• Počasí - Ano někde se i mění počasí, ale k čemu to sakra je, když se auto chová pořád stejně
[*]• Zatáčení - Ano i takovouhle blbost sem řadím, ale to se nedá udělat jinak. Prostě brždění téměř netřeba, prostě prudce zatočte...

[i]Na tu hru kašlete. Jestli si myslíte, že FlatOut 4 je špatná hra, tak k tomuhle se ani nepřibližujte. Ze hry jsem odehrál jenom 82 minut a většinou jsem jen zkoušel módy a hratelnost. Déle jsem to nevydržel. Normálně se snažím dělat vtipnější recenze, takže pokud vás i ta recenze nudila, tak víte jak se cítím já při hraní této hry.

[*]• Physics - this is as foreign a word to this game as if I say ""infinitisimal"" in front of you
[*]• Soundtrack - But wait. Is there such a thing at all?
[*]• Graphics - It's horrible, there's no other way to say it. (I think it's the same or even worse than FlatOut 1) In other words, if you're looking for a calculator game, go for it.
[*]• Optimization - This is unbearable. The game sometimes freezes and sometimes has FPS drops even with powerful equipment
[*]• What's the point of attributes like car power, speed or acceleration when all cars drive almost identically
[*]• Tuning - Is this really a negative? (If you know me, you know that in the review for another FlatOut episode I wrote that tuning is always positive - yes, exactly - so it's not). It doesn't even cost anything, just choose one before the race.
[*]• AI difficulty setting - It probably doesn't do anything at all, so what's the point?...
[*]• AI count setting - I would understand this option if the game was good, but it isn't.
[*]• The game looks cheap (I mean when I say it looks, it is)
[*]• When you bump into an opponent, they simply slow you down/stop you, they look the same, you look the same and you keep going
[*]• New mods could be nice, but what if you can still drive on grass and sand without slowing down with the formula. And what the hell is the Monstertruck mod? I didn't get it until now, and since all the opponents (AI) also had 0 points, neither did they.
[*]• Demolition derby - I don't know what to say anymore - The derbies here last so long and are so boring. that I actually never finished them.
[*]• Names of riders - Since I evaluated them in the 4th part as well, I can pretty much do anything here. Eva Mentos? Mr. Masked? Max Speed? Or even [b]Jan Benzín[/b]??
[*]• Destruction of cars - The rest is written in pros
[*]• Destruction of the environment - The rest is again written in positives 
[*]• Replayability - it is zero, there is no other way to say it
[*]• Weather - Yes, the weather changes somewhere, but what the hell is the point when the car always behaves the same
[*]• Turning - Yes, I include this kind of nonsense here, but there is no other way to do it. There is almost no need to brake, just turn sharply...

[i]You hate this game. If you think FlatOut 4 is a bad game, don't even go near this one. I've only played 82 minutes of the game and mostly just trying out mods and gameplay. I couldn't take it any longer. I normally try to do funnier reviews, so if that review bored you too, you know how I feel playing this game. As I read on the internet: [quote=Absolute Games]This game is not boring to play. It's disgusting to play with.[/quote]

As a childhood fan of Flatout 2 on the original Xbox, and a fan of the overall Flatout series, this is by far one of the WORST driving games I have ever played in my entire life and I'm kinda insulted that this is called a Flatout game. Here's why...

-   I've played mobile games with better graphics, driving mechanics, and overall game designing than Flatout 3.
The art looks outdated, and the game development looks & feels rushed (ie: the main characters/drivers look like low poly background characters).
-   The UI & HUD is all over the place in terms of design, placement, and aesthetics.
-   The driving mechanics are just awful. Either vehicles will turn way too quickly, or will have less grip of the road than any vehicle in GTA4. Either way, you'll easily lose control and crash into something unintentionally & rage about it within 30 seconds of racing. It's like the devs have never driven a car or have ever played a racing game before when making this crap.
-   Apparently there's music but, it certainly didn't sound anything like what the other titles had in the series. If you were expecting metal & rock, you will be disappointed.
-   The overall audio, especially crashing sounds, is similar to the quality of what you'd expect out of the static you'd hear from a telephone.

Игра получила огромный хейт из-за тех, кто играл во 2 часть и увидев сие чудо, просто были поражены, как такую легендарную серию игр довели до критического состояния. 
Из плюсов можно выделить:
+Огромный выбор автомобилей разных классов;
+Множество карт и режимов, из которых можно выделить зомби режим и дуэли;
+Появился выбор погоды, чем не могла похвастаться 2 часть;
+Довольно неплохая физика автомобилей (очень читерская у некоторых машин) по сравнению с 4 частью
Из минусов можно выделить:
-Отсутствие саундтрека;
-Наличие ужастно выедающих уши звуки машин;
-Возможные провалы под землю, либо телепорт в небо с уничтожением автомобиля;
-Бесполезность режима дерби из-за отсутствия каких-либо повреждений;
-Баг с пальто у персонажей, которое проваливается куда-то в текстуру
-Графика, выедающая глаза
Конечная оценка хоть и 4/10, но для меня она осталась не так уж плоха, как о ней говорили другие. Я, наверное, один из немногих, кто прошёл эту часть полностью (хотя что тут проходить? 50 испытаний и просто нудные гонки для получения ачивки). Самое для меня поразительное это то, что никто до сих пор ни с русского, ни с зарубежного сегмента не сделал полноценное прохождение этой игры. В основном это обсирание с ног до головы разработчиков игры","It's actually a pretty good game. So what if this game was made by completely different developers and on a different engine? It received a lot of hate because those who played Part 2 were shocked, upon seeing this marvel, that such a legendary game series had been brought to such a critical state.

Pros:
+Huge selection of cars of different classes;
+Multiple maps and modes, including zombie mode and duels;
+A choice of weather, something Part 2 couldn't boast of;
+Really good car physics (very cheaty for some cars) compared to Part 4.
Cons:
-Lack of a soundtrack;
-Presence of horribly ear-piercing car sounds;
-Possible falls through the ground or teleportation into the sky, destroying the car;
-Uselessness of the derby mode due to the lack of any damage;
- A bug with characters' coats that disappear into the texture somewhere
- Eye-searing graphics
The final score, although 4/10, wasn't as bad for me as others had said. I'm probably one of the few who completed this part completely (though what's there to complete? 50 challenges and simply tedious races to get an achievement). The most astonishing thing for me is that no one, either in Russia or abroad, has yet made a full walkthrough of this game. It's basically a slander on the game's developers."

- We have 6GB of game to download, and I still don't know what I downloaded. The first installment was only 1GB and is more complex.
- A few new modes are a plus, but the way the developers used this idea and what they did doesn't quite match up. It seems to me that the ideas for the new actions were borrowed from online games for 3-year-olds.
- If you want to play a fun racing game with chaos and destruction, I recommend the second installment, which is a hundred times better graphically and mechanically than this one.

Посторонись! Титан, выбивший все ачивки, сейчас расскажет всю истину об этом поделии.

НУ, НА САМОМ ДЕЛЕ...
[spoiler] игра реально полное говно [/spoiler]
[spoiler] но мне местами понравилось [/spoiler]

Во-первых - оно постоянно пытается тебя убить. Да, именно тебя, за монитором.
Во-вторых - оно никем не тестировалось, и иногда можно набить фейспалм от того, насколько идиотски игра реализована технически.
В-третьих - пройти её полностью - реальный челлендж.

[b]Противники[/b] - толпа демонов, поставленных на рельсы. Раббер-бендинг в придачу.
[b]Автомобили[/b] настроены отвратительно, физики ноль, но гравитация как на Юпитере. Модели иногда даже не совсем ужасные; спёр несколько, запихнуть в другую игру.
[b]Карты[/b], внезапно, иногда очень классные. Пока не начинаешь по ним гоняться, учитывая указанное выше.
[b]Графен[/b] - самое худшее от игр 2007 года в игре 2011 года.
[b]Геймплей[/b] - режимы сломаны, 80% проходятся всегда (если повезло) на первом месте. НО...
[b]КАК ЖЕ Я НЕНАВИЖУ ГОНКИ НОЧЬЮ С МЫЛЬНЫМ ДОЖДЁМ, ТАК ЕЩЁ И В ТАКОМ К[strike]А[/strike]ОЛИЧЕСТВЕ[/b], а в режиме с пятьюдесятью испытаниями есть два, которые забаланшены настолько через задницу, что пройти их либо нереально, либо очень тяжело без воли рандома. (подробно об этом далее). Режим [b]Splatout[/b] (он же недо-Кармагеддон), пожалуй, самый лучший (вернее, наименее раздражающий) в игре.
[b]Персонажи[/b] - замечательные обрыганы, лучше не видал.

[h2]Если кто-то намерен проходить это чудо на все ачивки:[/h2]

[b]Испытание №16[/b] можно пройти либо редактированием хэндлинга (SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Flatout 3\Vehicles\Common_Properties_[spoiler]Bus[/spoiler].XML) у клятого [spoiler]красного двухэтажного английского автобуса[/spoiler], либо проезжая всю трассу в обратном направлении, чтобы забрать чекпоинт, до которого невозможно допрыгнуть (противник при этом намертво тупит, поэтому беспокоиться о поражении не стоит). 

[b]Испытание №30[/b] (кстати, ночная гонка), ставит трёх соперников, которые заведомо быстрее игрока, но победить их можно, нарандомив тачки с ужасным управлением (чтобы боты не могли нормально проходить повороты), а также выставлением параметра скорости игры ""Классический"" (появляется при входе в режим испытаний каждый раз).

[b]Кстати[/b], испытания с трюками наоборот стоит проходить с ""Быстрой"" скоростью игры, потому что этот параметр напрямую влияет на скорость автомобиля игрока. Сэкономите нервы (хотя это под вопросом).

Для ачивки на [b]Комбо X150[/b] в Splatout рекомендую одну из последних карт, где кольцевой трек. Сбивать пеших торчков нужно так, чтобы разделить комбо на два круга (Зомби стоят рядами примерно по три, и на первом проходе стоит сбивать 1-2 зомбей из ряда).


[h3]Итого...[/h3]
[spoiler]Замечательная игра, чудесная.[/spoiler]

Рекомендую Flatout 3 только тем, кто уже видел всё, устал от нормальных игр и хочет испытать на себе все возможные тяготы и лишения.

Любимые карты - ""карпатские лесорубы"", ""немецкие стремительные демоны"", канализация, ""казахстанская резня""
Любимая машина - Нибаррет
Любимый герой - Зин Бензин

[b]3/10[/b]","[h1]SO[/h1]

Move aside! The Titan who knocked out all the achievements is about to tell you the whole truth about this thing.

WELL, IN FACT...
[spoiler] the game is truly complete crap [/spoiler]
[spoiler] but I liked it in places [/spoiler]

First, it's constantly trying to kill you. Yes, you, behind the monitor.
Second, it hasn't been tested by anyone, and sometimes you can facepalm from how stupidly the game is technically implemented.
Third, completing it completely is a real challenge.

[b]Enemies[/b] - a horde of demons placed on rails. Rubber banding to boot.
[b]Cars[/b] are terribly tuned, the physics are zero, but the gravity is like Jupiter. The models are sometimes not even completely terrible; I stole a few to shove into another game.
[b]The maps[/b] are, surprisingly, sometimes really cool. Until you start racing on them, considering the above.
[b]Graphene[/b] - the worst thing about 2007 games in a 2011 game.
[b]Gameplay[/b] - the modes are broken, 80% of them are always completed (if you're lucky) in first place. BUT...
[b]HOW I HATE NIGHT RACES WITH SOAPY RAIN, AND IN SUCH A NUMBER[/b], and in the fifty-challenge mode, there are two that are so poorly balanced that they're either impossible or very difficult to complete without the randomness. (More on that later). The [b]Splatout[/b] mode (aka sub-Carmageddon) is perhaps the best (or rather, the least annoying) in the game.
[b]The characters[/b] are amazing, I've never seen better.

[h2]If anyone wants to complete this miracle and get all the achievements:[/h2]

[b]Challenge #16[/b] can be completed either by editing the handling (SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Flatout 3\Vehicles\Common_Properties_[spoiler]Bus[/spoiler].XML) of the damned [spoiler]red double-decker English bus[/spoiler], or by driving the entire track in reverse to get a checkpoint that's impossible to reach by jumping (the enemy is completely stupefied, so you don't have to worry about losing).

Challenge #30 (a night race, by the way) pits you against three opponents who are obviously faster than the player, but you can beat them by randomizing cars with terrible handling (so the bots can't handle turns properly) and setting the game speed to ""Classic"" (which appears each time you enter Challenge mode).

By the way, stunt challenges should be completed with the game speed set to ""Fast"" because this directly affects the player's car speed. Save yourself some stress (though that's debatable).

For the [b]X150 Combo[/b] achievement in Splatout, I recommend one of the latest maps, the one with the circuit track. You need to shoot down the junkies on foot so that your combo splits into two laps (the zombies are arranged in rows of about three, and on your first run, you should shoot down one or two zombies per row).

[h3]Total...[/h3]
[spoiler]A wonderful game, marvelous.[/spoiler]

I recommend Flatout 3 only to those who've seen it all, are tired of normal games, and want to experience every possible hardship and deprivation.

Игра создана кучкой... эм.. даже не разработчиков, а неизвестных говноделов, называющих себя Team 6. Появилось это нечто уже после банкротства оригинальных разработчиков Bugbear и продажи прав на FlatOut неизвестно кому, поэтому к серии FlatOut не имеет ни малейшего отношения.
Итак, плюсы(неожиданно, правда?):
[list]
[*]-имеется аж 10 режимов игры, содраных по большей части из предыдущих игр, но есть один, который на хорошем движке можно было бы сделать конфеткой-Splatout. Суть его в том, что игроку надо давить зомби. Очень напоминает Кармагеддон. Было бы круто, если бы этот режим получил развитие в нормальной игре.
[*]-в принципе неплохая система повреждения авто
[*]-первая игра в серии, у которой появились достижения в Steam
[/list]
А в остальном игра-полное г.. с головы до ног.
Собственно, минусы:
[list]
[*]-Ужасная, отстойное управление. Можно долго распинаться, но лучше всего это описали на youtube-канале stopgame.ru в обзоре на это: ""...видов средств передвижения всего 2-это управляемые утюги и неуправляемые утюги..."" В первой Flatout, вышедшей на 7(!) лет раньше, управляемость и то лучше.
[*]-блевотная графика. всё настолько ужасно выглядит, как будто игру сделали на какой-нибудь слабенький телефон с Android, а потом криво портировали это на ПК 
[*]-к тому же разрабы зачем-то добавили тонны размытия(видимо, чтобы убогость графики не так бросилась в глаза). Но что будет если размазать govno? Правильно-ничего хорошего.
[*]-звук. ууух ты ж бл..., как же он ужасен. такое ощущение, что они содрали звуки из какой-то нормальной игры, потом включили их на дешёвом динамике, затянутом резиной и записали на телефонный диктофон.
[*]-музыка. слава яйцам, что она не играет во время гонок, ибо такое г... нужно ещё поискать.
[*]-игра весит 11 с лишним гб! Там что, в файлах игры спрятана ещё одна игра?
[*]-игра стоит 250р. Серьёзно? Да за это и 10 рублей жалко отдавать!
[/list]
Позорище а не игра. Но в приницпе, если бы она вышла лет 10 назад на Android, да за бесплатно и валялась бы где-нибудь в недрах Play market'а под названием "" игра машины ездить"" то ей можно было бы и 3 поставить. Но это Steam, это 2011 год, к тому же сейчас 250р. стоит! Так что nah... надо!

[h1]2 литра derma из 10[/h1]","[b]Flatout 3: Chaos & Destruction[/b] is a disgraceful page in the FlatOut series. The game was created by a bunch of... um... not even developers, but unknown shit-makers calling themselves Team 6. This thing appeared after the original developers, Bugbear, went bankrupt and the FlatOut rights were sold to an unknown party, so it has absolutely no connection to the FlatOut series.

So, the pros (surprising, right?):
[list]
[*]- there are as many as 10 game modes, mostly ripped off from previous games, but there's one that, with a good engine, could have been a real Splatout. The idea is that the player crushes zombies. It's very reminiscent of Carmageddon. It would be cool if this mode were developed further in a proper game.
[*]- basically a decent car damage system
[*]- the first game in the series to have Steam achievements
[/list]
Otherwise, the game is complete crap, top to bottom.
Actually, the downsides:
[list]
[*]- Terrible, crappy controls. I could go on and on, but it was best described in a review on YouTube channel stopgame.ru: ""...there are only two types of vehicles—controllable irons and uncontrollable irons..."" The first Flatout, released 7(!) years earlier, had better controls.
[*]- disgusting graphics. Everything looks so awful, as if the game was made for some low-end Android phone and then poorly ported to PC.
[*]- also, for some reason, the developers added tons of blur (apparently to make the poor graphics less noticeable). But what happens if you smear shit? That's right—nothing good.
[*]-sound. Oh, my god, it's so fucking awful. It feels like they ripped off the sounds from some decent game, then played them on a cheap speaker covered in rubber, and recorded them on a phone recorder.
[*]-music. Thank god it doesn't play during races, because you'd have to look hard to find that kind of crap.
[*]-the game weighs in at over 11 GB! Is there another game hidden in the game files?
[*]-the game costs 250 rubles. Seriously? It's a shame to pay even 10 rubles for this!
[/list]
This game is a disgrace. But basically, if it had come out on Android 10 years ago, and been free and lying around somewhere in the depths of the Google Play Store under the name ""Car Driving Game,"" it might have been worth a 3. But this is Steam, this is 2011, and it costs 250 rubles now! So, nah... it's necessary!

___________________________________________

 На днях поиграл еще раз в это поделие упоротых нидерландцев, а заодно поинтересовался самой студией и знаете что внезапно осознал? Что это самая качественная их игра на момент выхода! Серьезно. Вы только посмотрите на весь тот треш, что они выпускали до (да и после, чего уж тут) Flatout 3 и сами осознаете масштабы катастрофы. На впечатлениях от такого богатого портфолио я даже поменял отзыв с отрицательного на положительный. Пацаны, видимо, действительно старались, но как всегда что-то пошло не так и вместо шедевра у них вышло... ну что вышло, то вышло.
 Но в общем, если дистанциироваться от названия, серии и года выпуска, то игрушка-то, в целом неплохая. Да, с физикой беда, да, мыло и кислота сочится из каждого пикселя, да интерфейс чуть менее, чем полностью ужасен, да, багов вагон, но в виде тупых покатушек вполне себе годная.
ЗЫ: кстати, в русской локализации очень метко переведен пункт ""покинуть игру""- ""ПРЕКРАТИТЬ"". Прекратить издеваться над глазами, нервами, компом и перестать наконец в это играть. А в случае с разрабами- прекратить уже выпускать игры. Вообще. Поменять сферу деятельности, переехать в деревню, пасти огород и доить кур.","[i]I don't think anyone in their right mind would buy this trash, unless it was just for a collection and at a discount of over 90%, but it's worth a warning just in case =)[/i]
I was sitting here one day, bored, smoking tea, and thinking: ""Why don't we make a game like Flatout, and even call it the same? We won't bother with the engine, physics are completely irrelevant for games like this. We'll draw the textures at home over a beer in the evening—well, not all of them, of course, but some. And to make it look pretty, we'll fill it all with soap and make the color scheme more acidic. It'll be awesome—cars, bushes, and all that. Beautiful, functional, and trendy."" That's what they ended up doing...

___________________________________________

The other day I played this crazy Dutch creation again, and while I was at it, I inquired about the studio itself, and you know what I suddenly realized? That this was their highest-quality game to date! Seriously. Just look at all the trash they released before (and after, for that matter) Flatout 3, and you'll realize the scale of the disaster. Impressed by such a rich portfolio, I even changed my review from negative to positive. The guys obviously really tried, but as always, something went wrong, and instead of a masterpiece, they ended up with... well, what's done is done.
But overall, if you distance yourself from the name, series, and year of release, the game is pretty good overall. Yes, the physics are terrible, yes, soap and acid ooze from every pixel, yes, the interface is almost completely terrible, yes, there are tons of bugs, but as a silly gameplay experience, it's perfectly acceptable.
P.S.: By the way, the Russian localization very accurately translates the ""leave the game"" option as ""STOP."" Stop torturing your eyes, your nerves, your computer, and finally stop playing this. And in the case of the developers, stop releasing games. Completely. Change your career, move to the countryside, tend a garden, and milk chickens."

Но нет, вот она - третья часть FlatOut. Рассмотрим же ее поближе:

От классической серии игр - у нас осталось только название. 
* В игре переработано (читай уговнякано) все. От музыкальной состовляющей, которая поддерживала адреналин на нужном уровне, до физической модели самих автомобилей.

Как я писал выше - изменился саундтрек самой игры. Да, музыка меняется всегда, скажите вы. Но в этой игре - во время гонки Вы не услышите песню, что заставит ваше сердце стучать быстрее. Тут она только для фона.

* Графика в игре - тоже потерпела изменения. Ее зачем-то ухудшили. Вероятно в этом виноват бюджет для разработки. Но мне кажется - что тут проблема, в самих раработчиках. Потому что тут ЯВНО не BugBear. Минуту, проверю... Да. Некая Team6 Game Studios. О которой ничего толком не известно...
Графика, визуальные эффекты, движок - все явно сделано на Unity. По крайне мере мне показалось на первый взгляд. 

*Много мыла.
*Ужасное управление. Вероятно игра позиционировала себя как мобильный контент. Ну или приставочный вариант. Повороты резки, Прыжки - сделаны для галочки. Ручник вообще работает непонятно как. Проще входить в повороты - просто отпуская газ.

*Добавили множество вариантов игр. Особенно удивил Сплэттер - уровень, в котором нам предлагают давить зомби. Кармагеддон - ты ли это? Или мне кажется?


Как итог: 
Игра из разряда казуалок. Не советую тратить на нее деньги. Просто испортите себе настроение. Не стоит.","I literally learned about the third part during the 2018 summer sale. Until then, I thought there were only two (not counting Carnage). After that, the company was preparing Wreckfest (or am I mistaken?)

But no, here it is – the third part of FlatOut. Let's take a closer look:

All that remains of the classic game series is the name.

* Everything in the game has been reworked (read: trashed). From the music, which kept the adrenaline pumping, to the physics of the cars themselves.

As I wrote above, the game's soundtrack has changed. Yes, music always changes, you say. But in this game, during a race, you won't hear a song that makes your heart beat faster. Here, it's just for background music.

* The game's graphics have also undergone changes. For some reason, they've been downgraded. The development budget is probably to blame. But I think the problem lies with the developers themselves. Because this is CLEARLY not BugBear. Let me check... Yes. Some Team6 Game Studios. About whom nothing much is known...
The graphics, the visual effects, the engine—everything is clearly made in Unity. At least, that's what it seemed to me at first glance.

*Lots of bloatware.
*Terrible controls. The game was probably marketed as mobile content. Or at least as a console version. The sharp turns and jumps are just for show. The handbrake works incomprehensibly. It's easier to take turns by simply releasing the gas.

*They've added a variety of game modes. I was particularly surprised by Splatter—the level where we're asked to run over zombies. Carmageddon—is that you? Or am I imagining it?

In conclusion:
This is a casual game. I don't recommend spending money on it. It'll just ruin your mood. Not worth it."

Нитро в игре столько, что можно кнопку просто не отпускать.

Разрушаемость машин на более низком уровне настолько, что это зачастую не интересно выглядит.
Мини-игры испорчены, да и дерби тоже.
Дизайн некоторых трасс очень не нравится, из-за кучи мусора я не вижу ям и падаю в них.

At first, I didn't want to criticize the game too much. It's not that bad.
There's destruction, minigames, a bunch of modes, and it's playable.
It's a bad FlatOut, but not the worst racing game.

I would forgive the new car behavior, the lack of upgrades, and the new gameplay strategy.
However, it's worse than it seemed.
The game has so much nitro that you can practically hold the button down.
When I hit a train, the game freezes on my still-powerful PC.
The car destructibility is so low that it often doesn't look interesting.
The minigames are ruined, and so are the derbies.
I really don't like the design of some of the tracks; I can't see the potholes because of all the debris and keep falling into them.
The music is bland, and the graphics look much worse than in FlatOut 2.

Well, it's playable; I even liked some of the tracks. However, everything is really at a low level.

前作までのプレイ経験は無く、steamの2018春の大掃除イベントで初プレイ。

サムネイル選択から
実は3作目とは知らないまま始めて、ストアページを見て驚愕した。
これは試作版ではないのか？

おそらくFlatoutの物理演算なのか、動かしていて楽しい部分も一部ある。
（でもコースに車がはまる。）
なんというか、モードのバリエーションは多いのだけれど
肝心のゲーム部分が手抜きというか、ツメが甘い。
（Flatout名義や演算や他ゲームの真似事に頼ってるの？）
中核が無くてスカスカな虚無感。（ゲームデザインが悪いのか、開発センスが悪いのか）
楽しくないので段々億劫になってくる。
なんで、このゲームやってるんだろうって思えてくる。

たぶん、世の中にあるクソゲーの中でも
遊べるクソゲーだが、どこまでも低品質って感じでした。


プレイ後に、
ストアページでFlatoutの歴史を感じられたので、価値はあると思います。

でも、おすすめはしません。","I bought Flatout as part of a bundle because ""it seems fun.""
I hadn't played the previous games, and first played it during Steam's 2018 Spring Cleaning event.

I started playing it by selecting the thumbnail.

I started playing it without realizing it was actually the third game, and was shocked when I saw the store page.

Is this a prototype?

Perhaps it's Flatout's physics, but there are some parts that are fun to move around in.
(But the car keeps getting stuck on the course.)

How can I put it, there are a lot of mode variations,
but the core gameplay feels sloppy or lacking.
(Are they relying on the Flatout name, the math, or imitating other games?)
It lacks a core, leaving a hollow, empty feeling. (Is it bad game design or poor development sense?)
It's not fun, so it's gradually becoming a chore.

I'm starting to wonder why I'm playing this game.

It's probably a playable crap game among all the crap games out there,
but it just feels so low quality.

After playing,
I was able to get a feel for Flatout's history on the store page, so I think it's worth it.

However, I wouldn't recommend it."

Team 6 Studios продали права на франшизу Kylotonn. Они всё же сделали 4 часть которая всё же была лучше 3, но до первых 3 частей не дотягивает. Права на игру так и не вернулись Bugbear Entertainment. Это грустно когда любимая игра погибает на твоих глазах, а сделать ты ничего не можешь.(((","So why did Flatout go downhill? It's all because Bugbear Entertainment sold the franchise rights to Team 6 Studios, and that's where it all started. Part 3, a complete piece of crap that initially cost 1900 rubles and then 99 rubles, you can see where it was going... Team 6 Studios sold the rights to the Kylotonn franchise. They still made a fourth game, which was better than Part 3, but didn't quite measure up to the first three. Bugbear Entertainment never got the rights back.

Grafik hat was an sich wo mir gefällt , ist aber net die beste aus den Jahren .
Bin net der Große Rennspiel Liebhaber fahre eher in Far cry 2-5 mit den Autos herum ,die fahren sich fast gleich .
Ein gutes Spiel für zwischen durch.
10 Euro ist es sicher net wert aber wenns mal für 2 oder 1 euro im Angebot ist ,
kann es gut kaufen .

Ein Nachtrag dazu:

Spiele nun etwas mehr Rennspiele , Forza , Need of Speed, ...paar weitere  und kann mir jetzt eine bessere Meinung bilden .
Flatout 2 hab ich net gespielt ,berücksichtige das Spiel auch net in meiner Meinung .

Mal zur Grafik wieder : lustige, seltsame , ammüsante Grafik 
Steuerung  :  ist etwas Träge oder überreagierend , komme aber gut klar mit den Autos .
Rennen : die Rennen selbst im Spiel sind etwas gewöhnungs bedürftig 
Sonstige Modien z.b.  gegen die Mauerfahren das der Fahrer aus dem auto fliegt , ist nicht meins  genauso wo man die Auto kapputt fahren muss .

Ansonsten wie die meinung oben für 1-2 euro gut zum kaufen und macht Spass wenn man nicht weiss was man spielen soll.","The game isn't bad.
The graphics have something I like, but they're not the best in years.
I'm not a big racing game fan; I'd rather drive around with cars in Far Cry 2-5, which handle almost identically.
A good game for in-between times.
It's certainly not worth €10, but if it's on sale for €2 or €1,
I can definitely buy it.

An addendum to that:

I'm playing a few more racing games now, Forza, Need of Speed, ... a few others, and I can now form a better opinion.
I haven't played Flatout 2, and I don't factor it into my opinion.

Back to the graphics: funny, strange, amusing graphics.
Controls: a bit sluggish or overreactive, but I can handle the cars well.
Racing: The races themselves in the game take a bit of getting used to.
Other modes, like driving against walls where the driver flies out of the car, aren't my thing, just like the mode where you have to crash the car.

Otherwise, as with the review above, it's a good buy for 1-2 euros and fun if you don't know what to play."

Flatout 3 ужасен не только как flatout, но и как игра в целом.
 
Геймплей 2\10
 большенство машин не отличаются характеристиками друг от друга, играть скучно
Графика 0\10 
во второй части было лучше
Оптимизация 0тсутствует\10
Музыка хз\10
Я её выключил т.к. меня за 2 минуты заебала музыка из главного меню
 
НИ В КОЕМ СЛУЧАЕ НЕ ПОКУПАЙТЕ ЭТУ ИГРУ!!!
Если хотите поржать с друзьями над её убогостью, то скачайте пиратку.

ДЛИННАЯ ВЕРСИЯ

Графика и дизайн
Им было похуй на графику. У одной машины моделька как у игрушечных машинок из Paradise city, у другой раскраска на правой стороне тупо отзеркаленая раскраска левой. Колёса к машинам не прицеплены.

Геймплей
На геймплей и было тоже похуй. Покажите мне человека, который придумал, что нитро тебя хилит. Я хочу увидеть человека без мозга. Также покажите переводчика. Перевод на уровне плинтуса и охлажденя трахания, углепластики. Зато режимов много.

Гонки
Классы и иногда машины внутри классов различаются по характеристикам. Если напротив слова управление стоит 3 звезды из пяти, то машина низачто не впишется в поворот, а если стоит 4, то всё ок. Гонки здесь сделаны хуже чем в Cars the game

Дерби и большое дерби
Я хз как можно было сделать, что, когда тебя зажали у стены, то ты получаешь очки и скорее всего оказываешься в первой тройке. Я ешё хочу узнать, почему в классе ""класика"" есть машина, которая прочнее машин из ""дерби"" и почему в ""дерби"" есть машина с прочностью ОДИН из пяти? 

Ночные гонки
Гонки один на один ночью и под дождем. Лучше не стало

Режим с монстр траками
Этот режим - хуйня. Ты выполняешь какие-то ссаные задания и все. Почему это не гонки или дерби? 

Зомби режим
Пидоришь на модифицированной машине, переезжая зомби. Это скучнее, чем вы думаете. Вместо зомби можно поставить доски и ничего не изменится

Трюки
Где выбор угла под которым выбранный нами урод вылетит? Какого хера этим уродом в полете можно управлять ограниченое кол-во варемени? Где машины с реактивными двигателями?

Скоростные гонки
Вишенка на торте из говна. Ты едешь по АБСОЛЮТНО ПУСТОЙ ТРАССЕ с ботами на болиде формулы 1, который пидорит по песку, как по асфальту. При прикосновении к стене ты улетаешь из болида. На трассе ""Казахстанская резня""(я бля не шучу) Можно срезать повороты по песку (на болиде формулы 1). Некоторые повоты можно пропустить, врезавшись в стену(тебя поставят после поворота).

Бездорожье
я хз, кто придумал заставлять людей дрифтить на 4х4 машинах. побеждает тот, кто набрет больше очков за трюки. Чем ближе к первому месту ты финишировал, тем больше множитель очков. Вроде идея интересная(если забыть про вдифт на 4х4 машинах) но физика - кусок ебаного говнища.

ОПТИМИЗАЦИЯ
игра выглядит хуже, чем вторая часть, а лагает больше. Провисания происходят при: смене машины, перехода по главному меню, загрузке, начале гонки итд.


Вердикт 1/10 пиратская версия пойдет под певко на поржать","SHORT VERSION OF THE REVIEW

Flatout 3 is terrible not only as a flatout, but as a game in general.

Gameplay 2/10
Most of the cars have the same stats, it's boring to play.
Graphics 0/10
The second game was better.
Optimization 0/10
Music dummy.
I turned it off because the main menu music got on my nerves after two minutes.

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!!!
If you want to laugh at its ugliness with your friends, download a pirated copy.

LONG VERSION

Graphics and Design
They didn't give a damn about the graphics. One car has a model like the toy cars from Paradise City, another has a paint job on the right side that's simply mirrored on the left. The cars don't have wheels attached.

Gameplay
I don't give a shit about the gameplay either. Show me the person who invented nitro to heal you. I want to see a brainless person. Also, show me the translator. The translation is poor, and the cooling is crap, carbon fiber. But there are plenty of modes.

Racing
Classes, and sometimes cars within classes, have different characteristics. If the word ""handling"" is 3 out of 5 stars, then the car will absolutely not make the turn, but if it's 4, then everything is fine. The racing here is worse than in Cars the Game.

Derbies and Grand Derby
I don't know how they made it so that when you're pinned against a wall, you get points and most likely end up in the top three. I also want to know why the ""Classic"" class has a car that's more durable than the ""Derbies"" cars, and why the ""Derbies"" class has a car with ONE out of 5 durability?

Night Racing
One-on-one racing at night and in the rain. It's not any better.

Monster Truck Mode
This mode is crap. You complete some trivial tasks and that's it. Why isn't this a race or a derby?

Zombie Mode
You're driving a modified car, running over zombies. It's more boring than you think. You can replace zombies with planks and nothing will change.

Stunts
Where's the angle selection for the chosen monster truck's launch? Why the hell is this monster truck only controllable for a limited amount of time in flight? Where are the cars with jet engines?

High-Speed ​​Racing
The icing on the crap cake. You're driving a Formula 1 car on a COMPLETELY EMPTY TRACK with bots, which zips along sand like it's asphalt. If you hit a wall, you fly out of the car. On the ""Kazakhstan Massacre"" track (I'm not joking), you can cut corners on the sand (in a Formula 1 car). Some turns can be missed by hitting a wall (they'll put you back after the turn).

Off-Road
I don't know who came up with the idea of ​​forcing people to drift 4x4 cars. The winner is the one who scores the most points for stunts. The closer you finish to first place, the higher the score multiplier. It seems like an interesting idea (if you forget about drifting in 4x4 cars), but the physics are a piece of fucking crap.

OPTIMIZATION
The game looks worse than the second game, and lags more. Stuttering occurs when changing cars, navigating the main menu, loading, starting a race, etc.

Verdict: 1/10. The pirated version is good for a laugh with some singing."

41045031,russian,2018.02.25 19:22,❌,✅,0.549554944,4,"   Единственный + игры. Наличие достижений.
      Сразу бросилось в глаза при первом запуске игры наличии немалого кол-ва режимов. Но не всё так гладко. По сути разница в них невелика. Всё сводиться к тому,что ты ДОЛЖЕН быть первым во всём. И при этом не помереть на карте.Либо быть первым по кол-ву 'очков' 
      Музыки во время гонок нет вообще.Либо она была изначально,но это настолько высер,что ее вырезали. Либо для такого кала. Даже не стали заморачиваться. 
       Графика. Видимо порт с телефона или псп.
  Управление- Оно вроде и есть,но вроде и нет.Машина тебя слушаеться, заносов диких нет. Но по ощущению,Что оно кукольное-какое-то. Искуственное.
 -Система повреждений. Убожество. Заехал в воду,но выехал и засчитали.что утонул. Сняли прочность машины. Подпрыгнул на кочке, при приземлении на колеса. сняли прочность машины. Типо вмятины появляются. железки отваливаются.Но больше повреждений незаметил. Даже вроде водитель из авто не вылетает. 
 -Система тюнинга. Её наверное вообще забыли в игру внести. Все сразу прокаченно, только машины выбирай с разными характеристиками и цвет. А весь тюнниг заключается в выборе ' заводская настройка, дрифт, дрег, куег' и т.д. На показателях кроме других букв,я вообще ничего не заметил. Но во время загрузок в одну из гонок было написанно,что заводские 'НАСТРОЙКИ' лучше держат сцепление. Кхем.
   Добавили в игру кучу персонажей с крохотной историей про каждого. По итогу имеем, кучу персонажей мужского пола(модельки разные) и кучу персонажей женского пола с одной моделью тела. только перекрашенны и костюмы разные. Персонажи сделаны безобразно. *ука. во 2ой части игры были красиво нарисованны.А она какого года? Сами персонажи нина-что не влияют. 
 Есть зомби режим. ДУмал может он хоть порадует. По итогу таже вафля. типо, зомби. типо едешь по карте.типо давишь . Но никаких эмоций не вызывает.   
По итогу мы имеем. на  голову ниже чем первый продукт игры с портированной графикой с телефона или нинтендо. Я бы назвал эту часть. FLATOUT- 0 Боль и ИЗНЕМОЖЕ́НИЕ. Еще эта бесячая рамка вверху и внизу экрана. А_А_А_А . Кто придумал-это делать?! 
  Нужно осилить,как-то это творение. Достижения получить.","The game's only positive is the presence of achievements.
The first thing I noticed when I first launched the game was the presence of a fair number of modes. But not everything is so smooth. The differences between them are essentially negligible. It all comes down to the fact that you MUST be first in everything. And at the same time, not die on the map. Or be first in the score.
There's no music during races at all. Either it was there originally, but it's so crap that they cut it. Or, for this kind of crap, they didn't even bother.
Graphics. Apparently a port from a phone or PSP.
Controls - They seem to be there, but also sort of aren't. The car obeys you, there are no wild drifts. But it feels like a doll-like thing. Artificial.
Damage system. Pathetic. I drove into water, but came out, and they counted it as drowned. The car's durability was reduced. I bounced on a bump, landing on my wheels. They reduced the car's durability. Dents appear, and bits of metal fall off. But I didn't notice any more damage. It doesn't even seem like the driver is thrown out of the car.
- The tuning system. They probably forgot to add it to the game. Everything is already maxed out, you just have to choose cars with different characteristics and colors. And the whole tuning consists of choosing 'factory settings, drift, drag, KUEG,' etc. I didn't notice anything at all in the indicators, other than other letters. But when loading into one of the races, it said that the factory 'SETTINGS' hold the clutch better. Ahem.
They added a bunch of characters to the game with tiny backstories for each. As a result, we have a bunch of male characters (different models) and a bunch of female characters with the same body model. They're just repainted and have different costumes. The characters are horribly designed. *crap. They were beautifully drawn in the 2nd game. And what year is this? The characters themselves don't matter at all.
There's a zombie mode. I thought maybe it would at least be enjoyable. In the end, it's the same old story. Like, zombies. Like, you're driving around the map, like, crushing them. But it doesn't evoke any emotions.

In the end, we have something that's a cut above the first game with ported graphics from a phone or Nintendo. I'd call this part FLATOUT - 0 Pain and EXHAUSTION. And then there's that annoying frame at the top and bottom of the screen. A_A_A_A. Who came up with that idea?!

I need to master this creation somehow. Get the achievements."

40828733,koreana,2018.02.15 17:35,❌,✅,0.6041103005,7,"이번에 번들로 세일하길래 추억팔이겸 구매했는데 3편은 혹시나 추억보정으로 인해 해볼만 할까 싶어 손대봤더니 한번 구린건 세월이 지나 추억보정 되도 구리고 구린 추억이구나 함을 새삼 느꼈다. 켜자마자 레이스 한번 해보고선 어처구니가 없어서 삭제했다

그래픽이 전작인 2와 카니지 보다도 더 퇴보한듯 하다. 물론 실제로는 더 좋아진거긴 한데 정확히 표현하졈 게임 분위기에 드럽게 안어울린다. 심지어 로우 플리곤인 1편보다도 이질감이 심한데 이 게임 특성상 분위기가 좀 녹슬고 거칠고 투박한 쇳덩어리 질감이 나야 어울리는데 이 3편의 그래픽은 영화 분노의 질주 시리즈를 의식하고 벤치마킹 했는지 차들이 전체적으로 야광에 블링블링한 느낌이다. 차 그래픽 질감은 이런데 배경은 여전히 전작들의 분위기처럼녹슬고 거칠어서 차랑 배경의 이질감이 극심하다

그래픽은 뭐 그렇다 쳐도 레이싱 게임에서 가장 중요한게 바로 조작감인데 여러 리뷰어들의 혹평 그대로 차량의 무게감이 없어도 너무 없어서 차가 지면에 떠서 붕붕 날라다니는 느낌이다. 이 시리즈의 전매특허이자 장점이 묵직한 쇳덩어리가 쾅쾅 부딫히고 날라다니고 깨지는건데 그걸 싸그리 말아먹는 가볍고 엉성한 무게감과 조작감,타격감을 자랑한다

전작들과 후속작인 4편이 레이스에선 지고 있어도 특유의 이리 깨지고 저리 깨지는 묵직한 타격감 때문에  그 자체로도 재밌고 통쾌한데 3편은 부딫히면 내 차가 솜방망이 모냥 이리 붕붕 저리 붕붕이라 통쾌함은 커녕 발암에 빡치기만 한다

조작감과 무게감,타격감 이 작품이 갖는 타 레이싱 게임과의 차별성이자 장점이 사라진 가장 모순적인 작품이다

시리즈 최악임은 당연, 명작인 2편과 카니지와 비교하는건 감히 해서도 안될일이고
단언하건데 그래픽과 출시년도만 보고 설마 그래도 고전작인 1편보다는 낫겠지 하는 생각 조차도 하지말길 두번 단언하건데 1편이 3편보다 훨씬 재밌다

이 3편 빼고 나머지 다 따로 구매하는 가격보다 번들로 한꺼번에 산 가격이 더 싸서 구매했지
따로 구매하는건 세일로 사도 아까울 정도의 망겜. 이거 해보면 1편,2편,카니지가 얼마나 명작인지 그리고 호불호 갈리는 4편도 나름 준수한 작품이라는걸 다시한번 실감하게된다

추억 보정으로도 도저희 못살릴 작품","This time, it was on sale as a bundle, so I bought it to reminisce. I thought maybe the third installment would be worth a try, but I was struck by how much time has passed and how much the memories still hold up. I played a race right after launching it, and was so shocked that I deleted it.

The graphics seem to have regressed even further compared to the previous installments, Carnage 2 and Fury. While they're certainly improved in real life, they don't quite match the game's atmosphere. They even feel more out of place than the original, low-poly game. The game's aesthetic demands a rusty, rough, and rugged metal look. The graphics in this third installment seem to have been inspired by the Fast & Furious series, with the cars all having a shiny, bling-bling feel. The car graphics are as good as they come, but the background remains rusty and rough, reminiscent of previous games, creating a stark contrast between the cars and the background.

Even if the graphics are okay, the most important thing in a racing game is control. As many reviewers have criticized, the cars lack weight, making them feel like they're floating and flying around. This series' trademark and strength is the heavy, crashing, flying, and shattering metal, yet this game boasts a lightweight, sloppy weight, control, and impact that completely squashes that feeling.

While the previous games and its sequel, Carnage IV, may have lost in the races, their distinctive, heavy impacts, made them fun and exhilarating in and of themselves. However, in Carnage III, when a collision hits, my car bounces like a cotton ball, causing me to become irritated and even more infuriated. Far from being exhilarating, the controls, weight, and impact feel of this game have completely disappeared, making it the most contradictory game in the series.

It's the worst in the series, and comparing it to the masterpieces Carnage II and Carnage is a no-brainer.
I assure you, don't even think it's better than the classic first game based on the graphics and release date alone. I assure you twice that the first game is. It's much more fun than the third installment.

I bought the bundle because it was cheaper than buying all the others separately.
Buying them separately is a waste of money, even if it's on sale. Playing this will make you realize once again how great the first, second, and third installments of Carnage were, and how even the divisive fourth installment is a decent work in its own right.

No matter how much I reminisce, I can't bring it back to life."

And I am sure that we can all agree that this game wouldn't have been missed if it wasn't in any of the packs.

I can't recommend this game to anyone. Even if you like racing games in general, there is nothing of value here. It doesn't deserve the Flatout name in any way, shape or form. I'll go as far as to say anything Team 6 makes just isn't worth it. They started making games in 2001, and they haven't made anything that shows that they are worth buying from. I know making games is hard. I'm not saying that they can't make anything good. But come on guys. There hasn't been any effort put into this game, and it shows.

Лучше бы её выкинули из пака и оставили там первую, вторую части и ultimate carnage. Крайне не рекомендую.","Initially, when you get to the menu, the game seems fine: lots of modes, cars, characters, but when you start the first race, you realize it's just crap. It would be better if they removed it from the pack and left the first, second, and Ultimate Carnage games there. I highly recommend it."

Empece una carrera, ningun tutorial sobre como conducir, supuse cuales serian los botones y sirvio.
Me enfrente a una curva, y como no sabia frenar choque, asi fui mejorando para conducir, a choque y choque.
Por la segunda vuelta hice un derrape para dar vuelta, choque con un arbol y mi coche exploto, termine la carrera en 7mo lugar solo por terminarla.
En si el juego esta mal, derrapes muy exagerados, caidas de Cuadros por Segundo, Musica completamente aburrida y repetitiva, tuve que ponerle mute para aguantar la carrera.
Todos los negativos tienen la razon, las 5 peores GB descargadas en mi vida.
3/10 Tiene un Menu bonito

I started a race, there was no tutorial on how to drive, I just figured out what the buttons were, and it worked.
I faced a curve, and since I didn't know how to brake, I crashed, so I improved my driving, crash after crash.
On the second lap, I skidded to make the turn, hit a tree, and my car exploded. I finished the race in 7th place just to finish it.
The game itself is bad: exaggerated drifts, frame rate drops, and completely boring and repetitive music. I had to mute it to make it through the race.
All the negatives are right; the worst 5 GB downloads of my life.
3/10 It has a nice menu
After playing for a while, it's not that bad, it's still not recommended, but if you like something much more arcade-like with more exaggerated explosions and less realistic physics, you might enjoy it."

When the video settings options ""target framerate"" has an option for ""15fps"", you know you're in for a sh!t show. 

Racing:
The laughable driving mechanics feel clunkier than the 2nd Saints Row game. And you don't need to worry about avoiding obstcales, your car plows right through everything minus a building or a tree with minimal speed lose. The racing aspect is pitiful and cartoonish, if not downright insulting. Think boost is hard to come by, takes some slick maneuvering to gain, nope. You start the damn race with max boost already! Let alone the cpu has virtually unlimited boost as well, blast all the way down a straight away only to have the cpus a car length right behind you. ""Stuntman"" mode is trash. Instead of having multiple tries to get a specific score, you have one, which happens to a target that you need to hit perfectly and not a set distance or height; also, one of the male characters (Justin Case) has a female voice, which is sadly hilarious.

Controls:
The controls are vague in comparison to the previous games which will make you go to the control options screen. You'd think that you can't use a controller with the ""device"" settings on ""keyboard"", you're wrong. Actually switching the ""device"" setting from default to a controller option disables the controller and enables the keyboard, because it's Opposite Day when you play this game. That is if you'd even care to go in and MANUALLY set every single controller button in a game that has the option to use a controller but failed to auto set it for you.

The only enjoyable part I found was the ""Splattout!"" zombie mode, despite it being completely pointless for this type of game. You simply have achieve a specific score but it won't tell you that you have 2 minutes to achieve that. Not as though it would matter anyhow, it's embarrassingly easy that you can complete it with your eyes closed and using one hand. The game quickly turns into a personal test of how high of a combo you can get. Example: ""score at least 50,000 points"" in the 2 minutes, I ended up scoring over 8 million points by driving the course and keeping a combo.

The ""Monster trucks"" mode proly wouldn't be half bad if it wasn't for the damn team icon floating above your car and blocking most of your view, the fact that simply driving around the level and going off of jumps damages you just as much as ramming the enemy teammates. Your ""teammates"" are utter jackasses that actually ram you at the start if you don't purposefully avoid them, and the enemy trucks can easily overpower you and just grind on you until you explode. This of course will end at some point when you lose and the game crashes after the third/fourth retry with a ""-pure virtual function call"", as if the game itself is self-aware and pulls you out of the Matrix.","The only redeeming part that I found from this abortion of a game is that it has Steam achievements where the previous games don't, then again, playing this game will make you question where or not you'd care in the slightest to try to get them.

Da ich irgendwann mal die gesamte Flatout-Reihe zusammen gekauft hatte, und sich somit dieses Spiel ohnehin seit langem in meiner Bibliothek befand, entschied ich mich, es trotz der vielen negativen Reviews mal zu testen. Ich wusste, dass dieser Teil im Gegensatz zu Flatout 1, 2 und Ultimate Carnage, einer HD-Version des genialen 2. Teils, von einem anderen Studio entwickelt wurde. Und obwohl Flatout 2 und Ultimate Carnage wohl immer meine Favoriten bleiben werden, habe ich auch mit dem sauschweren Flatout 4 meine Freude. 
Zurück zu Flatout 3, welches, um es gleich vorweg zu nehmen, sehr enttäuscht, und zwar aus folgenden Gründen:
Die Grafik sieht zunächst einmal extrem schwammig, verschwommen und weichgezeichnet aus. Sowas erwarte ich vielleicht von einem Indy Rennspiel, das von einem Ein-Mann-Team mit der Unity-Engine entwickelt wurde, aber nicht von einem Flatout. Sicher - Flatout war nie eine AAA-Produktion. Die anderen Teile waren auch keine Grafikkracher. Aber sie hatten immerhin eine für ihre Zeit solide Grafik. Zweckmäßig und stimmig, wie man so schön sagt. Das ist hier leider keineswegs der Fall. 
Die Steuerung wurde schon oft als sehr schwammig beschrieben, und das muss ich leider bestätigen. Das Spiel wird dadurch zwar nicht unspielbar, leidet aber schon sehr.
Außerdem hinkt das Streckendesign, durchas eine Stärke der anderen Teile, meilenweit hinterher. Ja, es gibt auch hier Abkürzungen. Aber alles wirkt irgendwie ebenso wie Grafik und Steuerung billig zusammengeschustert.
Schlussendlich gibt es neben den normalen Rennen und den Destruction Arenen, die wir schon aus anderen Zeilen der Serie kennen, und die - soweit mit der schwammigen Steuerung möglich - durchaus Spass machen, auch einige absolut langweilige sinnfreie Modi. Das Speedrennen mit den Pseudo Formel 1 Wagen gehört für mich ebenso in letztere Kategorie wie die Monstertruck-Events, in denen man merkwürdife Aufgaben wie das Zerstören Explosiver Fässer bewältigen muss.
Der Modus, indem man auf einer offenen Karte mit großen Trucks durch verschiedene Tätigkeiten wie Zerstörung, Sprünge, Stunts und Geschwindigkeit Punkte erringen kann, ist zwar ganz lustig, reisst das Spiel aber auch nicht mehr raus. Ich muss mich meinen vielen Vorrednern anschließen: Absolut nicht zu empfehlen. Wenn man es sowieso hat, kann man es natürlich durchaus mal antesten.","The outlier in an otherwise brilliant arcade racing series

Since I had bought the entire Flatout series at some point, and this game had been in my library for a long time anyway, I decided to give it a try despite the many negative reviews. I knew that this installment, unlike Flatout 1, 2, and Ultimate Carnage, an HD version of the brilliant second installment, was developed by a different studio. And although Flatout 2 and Ultimate Carnage will probably always be my favorites, I also enjoyed the incredibly difficult Flatout 4.

Back to Flatout 3, which, to be clear, is very disappointing for the following reasons:
The graphics look extremely blurry, fuzzy, and soft-focus. I might expect something like that from an Indy racing game developed by a one-man team using the Unity engine, but not from Flatout. Sure, Flatout was never a AAA production. The other installments weren't graphically stunning either. But they at least had solid graphics for their time. Functional and coherent, as they say. Unfortunately, that's by no means the case here.

The controls have often been described as very vague, and I have to agree. While it doesn't make the game unplayable, it does suffer considerably.
Furthermore, the track design, a strength of the other installments, is miles behind. Yes, there are shortcuts here too. But everything, just like the graphics and controls, seems cheaply cobbled together.
Finally, in addition to the normal races and the Destruction Arenas, which we already know from other installments in the series and which are quite fun—as far as the vague controls allow—there are also some absolutely boring, pointless modes. The speed race with the pseudo-Formula 1 cars belongs in the latter category for me, as do the monster truck events, in which you have to complete strange tasks like destroying explosive barrels.
The mode, in which you can earn points on an open map with large trucks through various activities such as destruction, jumps, stunts, and speed, is quite fun, but doesn't really make the game stand out. I have to agree with many of the previous commenters: Absolutely not recommended. If you already have it, you can certainly give it a try."

BUT
For a game on sale for less than €5, it gets the job done. It's fun, there are plenty of game modes (and even a few playable ones!!!), there are plenty of cars, and it's a pleasant way to pass up a few winter vacation afternoons.

The car's handling, even considering the genre, is terrible. The car handles poorly on turns, when jumping off ramps, and when colliding with opponents.
Graphics? There's little point in talking about the graphics of a six-year-old game, but even by that time, they look terrible.

There's no music during races, leaving you to revel in the constant sounds of your opponents' nitrous oxide popping. This is surprising, considering that the soundtrack in this genre should set the right mood and make you feel driven.

The game doesn't really grab you; there are no strengths or advantages. It's better to stick with the previous games in the series.

The controls are reeeaaally clunky, you will drive into a lot of stuff if it doesn't move out of the way. Sadly, not a lot of stuff is moving out of the way.
AND! There is a zombie mode. A really bad zombie mode. Why the fuck did they think FlatOut needs a zombie mode?

Really. Don't buy this game.
Ever.
Not even on sale.
Not even for the 'hey I bought a crappy game to make fun of' 5 minutes of amusement.
It's not even good enough for that."

Красноречиво и правильно пишет редакция журнала ""Игромания"". После [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/12360/FlatOut_Ultimate_Carnage/]FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage,[/url] игра перешла в руки Team 6 Studios, которые решили угробить серию FlatOut. 
Ладно. На самом деле, вряд ли разработчики преследовали данную цель. Но а что думать о Flatout 3: Chaos & Destruction?
Собственно об игре. Начнем с того, что в игре нет карьеры. Проходя гонку за гонкой мы открываем новые трассы и машины. Мультиплеер здесь есть, но вроде как он не работает. Автомобили здесь старые и знакомые нам, так же есть новые. Хочется отметить, что разработчики решили добавить юмора в игру, чего не было ранее. Например, на выбор у нас есть много всяких персонажей (Неизвестный игрок похож на Стига, из ""Top Gear"", Зин Бензин - на Вина Дизеля, в образе Риддика). 
Графика и физика в игре - отдельная тема. Графика в игре довольно мутная и плохая. Различия между ""Ультра"" и ""Очень низко"" заметны, да, но явных улучшений нет. Физика, здесь, тема больная. Машина запросто разгоняется до 150 миль в час, так же резко тормозит, и слишком круто поворачивает. Втащиться в оппонента на такой скорости, может отправить последнего в космос. По трамплинам, машина прыгает просто ужасно, пикирует вниз через 2-3 метра полета.

Я старался уменьшить негатив к данной игры. Это мой первый обзор, в котором я не рекомендую к покупки игру. Жаль, что это игра серии FlatOut. Культовая, для меня.
Если и покупать игру, то только для коллекции всех FlatOut или чтобы самому убедиться, что игра плоха. Но я бы порекомендовал скачать ее с торрентов, нежели самому покупать.","[h1]""The initial urge to wipe the monitor to get a clear picture quickly gives way to the desire to erase the game itself from the hard drive.""[/h1] [i][url=https://www.igromania.ru/article/19978/FlatOut_3_Chaos_and_Destruction.html]link to original source[/url][/i]

The editors of Igromania magazine write eloquently and accurately. After [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/12360/FlatOut_Ultimate_Carnage/]FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage,[/url] the game passed into the hands of Team 6 Studios, who decided to kill the FlatOut series.

Okay. In reality, it's unlikely the developers had that goal in mind. But what should we think of Flatout 3: Chaos & Destruction?

About the game itself. Let's start with the fact that there's no career in the game. As you complete races, you unlock new tracks and cars. There's multiplayer, but it doesn't seem to work. The cars are old and familiar, and there are also some new ones. It's worth noting that the developers decided to add a touch of humor to the game, something that wasn't there before. For example, we have a variety of characters to choose from (the Unknown Player resembles the Stig from ""Top Gear,"" and Zin Benzin resembles Vin Diesel as Riddick). 
The graphics and physics in the game are a separate issue. The graphics are quite muddy and poor. The differences between ""Ultra"" and ""Very Low"" are noticeable, yes, but there are no obvious improvements. Physics, however, is a sore point here. The car easily accelerates to 150 mph, brakes just as sharply, and turns too sharply. Crashing into an opponent at that speed can send them flying into space. The car jumps terribly on ramps, diving down after 2-3 meters.

I tried to minimize the negative reaction to this game. This is my first review in which I don't recommend it. It's a shame it's a FlatOut game. It's a cult classic for me.
If you buy the game, it would be only for a FlatOut collection or to see for yourself how bad it is. But I would recommend downloading it from torrents rather than buying it yourself."

Ok ein Schickes intro mit Passender musik wie z.b. im 1 teil  gibt es nicht, passt schon nur wird man hier in ein lieblos hingerotztes Menü geworfen mit passender Dödel gähn Musik und kann aus allerlei Modi wie Singleplayer , Multiplayer oder minispielen auswählen, nicht alles ist sofort  spielbar was ok ist, man möchte sich ja auch etwas erspielen  nur kann das hier die Neven stark strapazieren. 
Einen Karriere Modus gibt es nicht ebenso wenig wie die möglichkeit seine Autos zu tunen , man Klappert hier öde gebiete ab  und Schaltet so z.b weitere rennen oder den herausforderungs modu frei, wenns spaß machen würde was es aber nie und nimmer tun wird könnte ich hier etwas Positives sagen, aber so gut wie jedes rennen startet mit einem Massencrash dank der Rambo Ki, auf der anderen seite ist die Ki aber auch stroh doof und bleibt gerne an Objekten hängen und es einem leicht gemacht wird diese in einem rennen mehr als einmal zu überrunden, was auch eine Augenweide ist ist die Unterirdische grafik für die sich selbst manche Ps2 Titel schämen würden und der übertriebene verwischeffekt der dafür sorgt das man mit einem tango von der piste fliegt , selbst kleinste unebenheiten auf der strecke   die verkorkste fahrphysik oder auch ein Lachflash können dafür sorgen.
Den Onlinemodus konnte ich an dieser stelle nicht testen da es einfach keine Mitspieler gibt und selbst die 2 oder 3 größten hardcore fans da draussen mittlerweile die Schnauze voll haben dürften von diesem meisterwerk.

Pro

Haha guter Witz

Contra

So ziemlich alles 


Flatout 3: Chaos and Destruction ist eines der spiele bei dem so ziemlich alles in die Hose ging , miese Grafik, miese fahrphysik, miese Ki, mieser sound einfach von vorne bis hinten mies, es macht einfach keinen spaß und wäre selbst geschenkt noch zu teuer, Team 6 Studios setzen 6, Positiv sei hier höchstens zu erwähnen das uns der Entwickler zeigt wie man spiele besser nicht programmieren sollte.","Oh yes, what times those were when you could sit comfortably on the sofa on Xbox and Playstation 2 and play a round of Flatout 1 and 2 with a few friends. A great rocking soundtrack, tough and challenging races, split-screen mode and fun mini-games still inspire me today, and then came... (I hardly want to say it out loud and yet I have to) Flatout 3 is truly the holy grail of gaming gems in the very back row.
Okay, there isn't a fancy intro with suitable music like in the first part, that's fine, but here you're thrown into a carelessly thrown-together menu with suitable stupid yawn music and you can choose from all sorts of modes like single player, multiplayer or mini-games. Not everything is playable straight away, which is fine, you do want to earn something, but it can really test your nerves.
There is no career mode, nor is there any way to tune your cars. You drive through boring areas and unlock other races or the challenge mode, for example. If it were fun, which it never will be, I could say something positive here, but almost every race starts with a mass crash thanks to the Rambo AI. On the other hand, the AI ​​is also incredibly stupid and tends to get stuck on objects, making it easy to lap them more than once in a race. What is also a feast for the eyes are the sub-par graphics, which even some PS2 titles would be ashamed of, and the exaggerated blurring effect that makes you fly off the track in a tango. Even the smallest bumps on the track, the messed up driving physics, or even a laughing fit can cause this. I couldn't test the online mode at this point because there are simply no other players, and even the two or three biggest hardcore fans out there are probably fed up with this masterpiece by now.

Pros

Haha, good joke

Cons

Pretty much everything

Flatout 3: Chaos and Destruction is one of those games where pretty much everything went wrong: lousy graphics, lousy driving physics, lousy AI, lousy sound—just terrible from start to finish. It's simply no fun and would be too expensive even if it were free. Team 6 Studios is giving it a 6. The only positive thing to mention here is that the developer shows us how not to program games."

Многие ругали её за плохое управление, хотя тут были виноваты, скорее всего, сами игроки и обзорщики или же они просто хотели лишний раз игру в чём-то обвинить. Я поиграл в неё, и... о чудо... я ей остался доволен! Да-да! Я проехал несколько гонок и понял, что с управлением в игре не всё так плохо. Тут уже надо перед поворотом тормозить (если поворот достаточно крутой). Физика. А вот с ней есть одна странность. Если в гонке вы сопернику ударом не причините вред, то в режиме дерби вы уже сможете врага легко отправить на тот свет, просто разогнавшись и присоединив к чей-то бочине свою машину. Выиграть гонку довольно легко даже на высоком уровне сложности (звучит странно, но это так). А вот с интелектом соперников тут беда. В общем, многие скорее всего просто не знали, в чём эту игру ещё обвинить, но я могу сказать одно: во многих случаях эти обвинения были неоправданы.","In my opinion, the game isn't that bad.

You have to brake before turning (if the turn is sharp enough). Physics. But there's one odd thing about it. While you can't harm your opponent with a hit in a race, in derby mode you can easily dispatch an enemy simply by accelerating and attaching your car to someone else's side. Winning a race is pretty easy even on the hardest difficulty (sounds weird, but it's true). The real problem here is the opponent's intelligence. In general, many most likely simply did not know what else to accuse this game of, but I can say one thing: in many cases, these accusations were unjustified."

3) The interface is terribly designed: low-quality textures, lots of toxic hues, yellow font on a yellow background, and so on. It's not pleasant to look at!

4) The physics are absolutely cardboard, with opponents moving like they're on rails at unrealistic speeds.

В то время, как мои друзья пытались одолеть Underground 2 на красивых хромированных тачках, я устраивал дестрой на ржавых драндулетах и мне это доставляло намного больше удовольствия, чем тюнинг и прочие модные фишки гоночных игр того времени. Особый интерес для меня представлял, конечно же, режим трюков, ибо это была первая игра, в которой можно было запустить водителя в свободный полёт.

Про вторую часть мне сказать нечего, т.к. на момент её выхода у меня был достаточно древний компьютер, поэтому Flatout 2 (как и многие другие игры) прошёл, или даже проехал, теряя запчасти, мимо меня.

Когда я впервые увидел скриншоты третьей части серии, у меня появилось странное предчувствие, как будто я уже видел нечто подобное. И, к сожалению, предчувствие меня не обмануло. Отсюда и начнём устраивать разнос.

Обо всём по порядку

В первую очередь, хотелось бы сказать пару «ласковых» о создателях этого шЫдевра. Есть в России конторка, которая называется «Медиа-Сервис 2000», специализирующаяся на так называемых «играх для супермаркетов» — это малобюджетные поделки соответствующего качества. Специализируются они, в основном, на выпуске различных недошутеров. Так вот, Team6 – это побратим нашего трэшодела, только спецификация другая, а именно – аркадные гонки.

Думаю, что многие из вас видели хотя бы одну из игр этой конторы: Taxi 3: eXtreme Rush, Shanghai Street Racer, German Street Racing, и т.д. Это гонки очень низкого качества, с отвратительным управлением, отсутствием физики и с довольно посредственной графикой. Последнее – единственное, что менялось в играх этой конторы. В целом же, никаких изменений ни в движке, ни в геймплее не происходило.

Flatout 3 не отличается от своих предшественников ни на йоту. Остановимся на каждой составляющей отдельно.
Меня хватило только на два режима игры – это обычная гонка и режим трюков. Первый я выключил, кое-как проехав первый круг. Всё что вы будете делать в этом режиме – это взрываться, вылетать за пределы трассы, снова взрываться, смотреть на кучу искр и дыма, а так же на груду металлолома, которую Team6 хотели выдать за автомобили... Ах да, я уже говорил, что вы будете ВЗРЫВАТЬСЯ?

На втором режиме я задержался подольше. Первый трюк – попасть в мишень, благополучно преодолев огромную мельницу. Казалось бы – что сложного? А сложность в том, что у нас есть только ОДНА попытка и попасть мы должны строго в ЦЕНТР. Я раз 20 пытался это сделать, и всё-таки сделал, причём уже отчаявшись. А вот на втором трюке я оставил это гиблое дело. Может быть, я делал что-то неправильно, но я так и не смог преодолеть этот холм.

В общем, геймплей, мягко говоря, отвратительный. Хотя если вам нравится наблюдать кашу из 16 машин на трассе, сдобренную дымом и искрами, то флаг вам в руки. А я поеду дальше.

Единственное, над чем Team6 хоть как-то поработали – это графическая начинка игры. Если сравнивать со всем остальным, то она не так уж плоха. Да, конечно не Need For Speed: The Run, но выглядит вполне сносно. Если бы не одно, или даже два «НО». Первое – это Reflective Bump, который есть на всём, чём только можно, ну кроме водителей. Всё в игре блестит так, как будто заранее смазано маслом или полито водой. Ладно, когда идёт дождь, например, это ещё хоть как-то смотрится. Но когда в солнечный день дорога блестит и переливается, это смотрится, как минимум, странно. А если учесть низкое качество текстур, то всё это смотрится вдвойне убого. А второе, как вы уже наверняка догадались, — это блум. Тонны блума, который режет глаза.

Разумеется, всё изобилие постобработки не могло не сказаться на производительности. На моём относительно не старом (особенно для такой игры) компьютере, счётчик FPS кое-как переваливает за 20 кадров. Как видите, и в этом плане Team6 просчитались. Если бы они сделали возможность отключать постобработку вообще, возможно тогда всё происходящее на экране не выглядело бы столь вырвиглазно.
Тут говорить особо не о чем, потому что Flatout 3 понятие «физика» не знакомо. Машины не имеют веса – можно смело таранить своих оппонентов, но в то же время, они так же легко смогут сбить вас. Некоторые части окружения (например, заборы и столбы) разрушаемы, но кого сейчас этим удивишь. Так же, нельзя не отметить убогую Ragdoll анимацию, времён второго Hitman«а.

Пытаться управлять доверенным нам утюгом – бесполезно. Если вам удастся войти в поворот, это будет чистая случайность. Вам не нравилось управление в играх серии NFS? Вы считали, что это – самый настоящий симулятор утюга? Забудьте. По сравнению с Flatout 3, в NFS управление, приближенное к реальному. И снова промах. Браво, Team6!

Flatout 3 – одна из самых ужасных игр, что я когда-либо видел. Доверить разработку игры Team6 было самой роковой ошибкой. Даже если издатель разорился и на нормальных девелоперов не хватило средств, не стоило кидаться в такие крайности. Третья часть игры официально загубила серию и носить гордое имя Flatout не достойна. Финальный продукт не стоит даже скачивания, а покупки – тем более. Лучше ещё раз пройти первую или вторую часть и вспомнить всё хорошее, что у вас было связано с названием &ldquo;Flatout&rdquo; до того, как появилось это убожество.
","Flatout was one of my favorite games as a child. While my friends were trying to conquer Underground 2 in fancy chrome cars, I was wreaking havoc in rusty jalopies, and I found it far more enjoyable than tuning and other trendy features of racing games at the time. Of particular interest to me, of course, was the stunt mode, as it was the first game where you could launch a driver into free flight.

I can't say anything about the second game, as my computer was quite old when it came out, so Flatout 2 (like many other games) passed me by, or even drove past, losing parts.

When I first saw screenshots of the third game in the series, I had a strange premonition, as if I'd seen something like this before. And, unfortunately, my premonition was right. From here, let's begin the scolding.

First things first

First of all, I'd like to say a few kind words about the creators of this masterpiece. There's a company in Russia called ""Media-Service 2000,"" which specializes in so-called ""supermarket games""—low-budget, high-quality creations. They primarily focus on releasing various half-baked shooters. Team6 is a sister company to our trash-making company, but with a different focus—arcade racing.

I'm sure many of you have seen at least one of this company's games: Taxi 3: eXtreme Rush, Shanghai Street Racer, German Street Racing, etc. These are very low-quality racing games, with terrible controls, no physics, and rather mediocre graphics. The latter is the only thing that has changed in this company's games. Overall, there have been no changes to either the engine or the gameplay.

Flatout 3 isn't one iota different from its predecessors. Let's look at each component separately.
I only lasted through two game modes – the regular race and the stunt mode. I turned off the first one after barely making it through the first lap. All you do in this mode is explode, fly off the track, explode again, stare at a pile of sparks and smoke, and a pile of scrap metal that Team6 tried to pass off as cars... Oh yeah, did I mention you'll EXPLODE?

I spent a little longer on the second mode. The first stunt is to hit the target, safely navigating a huge windmill. It seems like there's nothing difficult about it. The difficulty is that you only have ONE try, and you have to hit the CENTER. I tried it about 20 times, and finally managed it, even though I'd given up. But after the second stunt, I gave up on the hopeless task. Maybe I did something wrong, but I just couldn't get over that hill.

Overall, the gameplay is atrocious, to say the least. Although if you enjoy watching 16 cars splattered on the track, peppered with smoke and sparks, then go for it. I'll keep going.

The only thing Team6 has improved is the game's graphics. Compared to everything else, it's not that bad. Sure, it's not Need For Speed: The Run, but it looks pretty decent. If it weren't for one or two ""BUTs."" The first is the Reflective Bump, which is present on everything, well, except the drivers. Everything in the game shines as if it's been pre-oiled or watered. Okay, when it's raining, for example, it's at least somewhat noticeable. But when the road is shiny and shimmering on a sunny day, it looks, at the very least, odd. And considering the low texture quality, it all looks doubly pathetic. And the second thing, as you've probably already guessed, is the bloom. Tons of bloom, which is an eyesore.

Of course, all this post-processing has an impact on performance. On my relatively new computer (especially for this game), the FPS counter barely breaks 20 frames. As you can see, Team6 has miscalculated here too. If they'd made it possible to disable post-processing altogether, perhaps everything happening on the screen wouldn't look so eye-popping.
There's not much to say here, because Flatout 3 doesn't have the concept of ""physics."" Cars don't have weight—you can safely ram your opponents, but at the same time, they can just as easily knock you down. Some parts of the environment (like fences and poles) are destructible, but who's surprised by that these days? Also, I can't help but mention the pathetic ragdoll animation, reminiscent of Hitman 2.

Trying to control the iron entrusted to us is futile. If you manage to corner, it will be pure chance. You didn't like the controls in the NFS games? You thought this was a real iron simulator? Forget it. Compared to Flatout 3, NFS controls are closer to real life. Another miss. Bravo, Team6!

Flatout 3 is one of the worst games I've ever seen. Entrusting the game's development to Team6 was the most fatal mistake. Even if the publisher went bankrupt and didn't have the funds for proper developers, they shouldn't have gone to such extremes. The third game officially ruined the series and isn't worthy of the proud name Flatout. The final product isn't even worth downloading, much less buying. It's better to go through the first or second part again and remember all the good things you had associated with the name ""Flatout"" before this abomination appeared.

But, I'm having a lot of fun with it. It took me over an hour to get in 3rd place in the first track, and I just happen to love the mayhem and challenge of a mindless fun arcade title.

Eis que vejo Flatout na steam com promoção. Comprei lembrando dos saudosos tempos de PS2, quando eu passava finais de semana inteiros com meu pai jogando Flatout, Crash, Pes e outros clássicos. Rindo, conversando, foi um dos tempos que mais criei recordações com meu pai, sempre memórias boas.
Não me recordava qual era o flatout que joguei no PS2, então decidi comprar o mais recente pois pensei que seria um jogo que me agradaria agora e me lembraria o passado.
PIOR ESCOLHA DA MINHA VIDA
Deturparam tudo de bom que esse jogo tinha que me fascinava quando criança.
Conseguiram fazer tamanha merda em formato de jogo, de modo que os gráficos, física e jogabilidade mais kagado do que se fizessem um jogo de corrida filmando pedras subindo uma cachoeira.
NADA NESSA PORRA DE JOGO É BOM
Se for comprar um Flatout pra assim como eu, matar a saudades dos velhos tempos, não se enganem, comprem o 1,2 ou ultimate carnage. Finja que esse daqui nunca existiu.
Além de roubar meu dinheiro, esse jogo estragou minha tarde. Terminei comendo minha namorada com muita indignação. Eu tava putasso e ela acabou percebendo, eu não queria falar que era por causa de um jogo lixo como esse. Então numa crise de genialidade falei que eu tava pu.to porque achei que meu pau tivesse diminuido. Ela simplesmente riu, falou pra gente deixar pra outro dia e foi embora.
Enfim
Não comprem esse jogo por favor","I was feeling great here at home, relaxing, waiting for my girlfriend to arrive.
Then I saw Flatout on Steam on sale. I bought it, remembering the fond memories of the PS2, when I'd spend entire weekends with my dad playing Flatout, Crash, PES, and other classics. Laughing and talking, it was one of the times I created the most memories with my dad—always good ones.
I couldn't remember which Flatout I played on the PS2, so I decided to buy the latest one because I thought it would be a game I'd enjoy now and would remind me of the past.
WORST CHOICE OF MY LIFE
They distorted everything good about this game that fascinated me as a kid.
They managed to make such a mess of the game format, making the graphics, physics, and gameplay look worse than if they'd made a racing game filming rocks climbing a waterfall. NOTHING IN THIS FUCKING GAME IS GOOD
If you're going to buy Flatout to, like me, reminisce about the good old days, don't fool yourself, buy 1, 2, or Ultimate Carnage. Pretend this one never existed.
Besides stealing my money, this game ruined my afternoon. I ended up fucking my girlfriend in a fury. I was so pissed off, she noticed. I didn't want to tell her it was because of a trashy game like this. So, in a fit of genius, I told her I was pissed because I thought my dick had gotten smaller. She just laughed, told us to save it for another day, and left.

32235936,russian,2017.05.07 13:56,❌,✅,0.5185185671,1," Мда, ""порадовал"" меня сей релиз. В отличие от большинства консерваторов, которые выросли на первом и втором Flatout соотвественно (я в их числе), я старался обнадёжить себя тем, что изюминку какую-нибудь игра имеет. Но...

 1. Абсолютно ужасный шипящий звук и саундтрек в целом.
 2.Физика машин и окружающего мира. Машину при столкновении с маленькой кочкой, даже бигфут, раскидывает по всей трассе. Опять же про камни. Если большие булыжники легко разрушаемые объекты, то ""речные  камушки"" не сдвинешь никак.
 3.Ужасно сделанный челлендж. Например, задание 19 я не знал как делать, пока не погуглил (надо разворачиваться назад и езжать до контрольной точки, а за рулём автобуса это полчаса).
 4. Ужасно сделанные трюки с вылетом водителей. Освоить их практически невозможно и тут надо надеяться на удачу.
 5. Дерби...Без комментариев. Но поверьте, от него ваше отверстие запылает ярким пламенем. А ведь именно это была главная (одна из главных) фишка, за которую любили серию Flatout.
 6.Персонажи. Во-первых, оригинальностью они не отличаются, а их биография вызывает недоумение. Видимо, шутить разрабы неочень умеют. А во-вторых, все эти модельки с малым количеством полигонов очень уродливы, а при вылете из машины судорожно дёргаются на земле.

 Из плюсов же (да, не удивляйтесь, у неё есть даже плюсы) я мог бы отметить неплохие гонки на Formula1, общую концепцию трасс (трассы, действительно, интересны, но вкупе с геймплеем это не заметно), ну и, конечно же Москву. Да-да, одна из трасс для дерби и есть Красная площадь. А, ну да, ещё зомби-мод поможет расслабиться после всей вакханалии.

 Я думал, что вся игра сплошняком покрыта шлаком. Всё-таки где-то там и там проблескивают плюсики. Но в преобладании минусов игру не рекомендую никому. Даже если вы не знакомы со вселенной Flatout. Цитата :""Это настолько трэш, что хочется поиграть. Но игра не рекмендуется никому"".","Yeah, I was ""delighted"" with this release. Unlike most conservatives who grew up on the first and second Flatouts, respectively (myself included), I tried to convince myself that the game had some kind of unique twist. But...

1. Absolutely terrible hissing sound and overall soundtrack.
2. Car and environment physics. A car, even a Bigfoot, gets thrown all over the track when hitting a small bump. Again, about the rocks. While large boulders are easily destructible, you can't move these ""river pebbles"" at all.
3. Horribly designed challenges. For example, I didn't know how to do challenge 19 until I googled it (you have to turn around and drive to the checkpoint, and that's half an hour behind the wheel of a bus).
4. Horribly designed stunts with driver ejections. Mastering them is practically impossible, and you have to rely on luck.
5. Derby... No comment. But believe me, it will set your orifice ablaze. And yet, that was the main (one of the main) feature that made the Flatout series so beloved.
6. Characters. Firstly, they're not particularly original, and their backstories are puzzling. Apparently, the developers aren't very good at humor. Secondly, all these low-polygon models are incredibly ugly, and when you fly out of the car, they jerk violently on the ground.

On the plus side (yes, don't be surprised, it even has its pluses), I'd point out the decent Formula 1 racing, the overall track concept (the tracks are indeed interesting, but combined with the gameplay, it's not noticeable), and, of course, Moscow. Yes, one of the derby tracks is Red Square. Oh, right, the zombie mod will help you unwind after all the mayhem.

I thought the entire game was a complete sham. There are still some positives here and there, though. But with so many negatives, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Even if you're not familiar with the Flatout universe. Quote: ""It's so trashy that you want to play it. But I don't recommend it to anyone."""
32205300,brazilian,2017.05.05 22:14,✅,✅,0.5641964078,14,"Então, eu recomendo o jogo desde que você compre ele em promoção, não no preço normal, por que?

- O jogo é legal sim. Há vários modos de jogo, desde corridas até um modo de atropelar zumbis.

- Está com vários bugs? Sim, mas nada que não impeça você de se divertir algumas horas.

- Realmente tem carros que são bem dificeis de se controlar, dependendo da velocidade que você vier você não irá conseguir fazer a curva, enquanto os oponentes fazem ela como se fosse uma reta normal xD 

- Tem carros que se você assoprar do lado dele ele já fica com menos de 50% de health, é chato? É. Mas é só se cuidar.

O F3 possui vários bugzinhos que poderiam ser facilmente arrumados, inclusive crashes durante o jogo mas não é nada que impeça você de jogar. Vale sim apena comprar o jogo, mas desde que pegue uma boa promoção. O jogo conta com vários modos de jogo, possui vários carros e skins legais. O jogo é bem leve, qualquer computador roda ele, embora ele tenha alguns problemas e parece que foi mal otimizado, teve horas que tava a 130FPS mas parecia que tava com menos de 30, eu não dou bola. Você vai jogar, vai ver os bugs, mas você vai estar tão entretido no jogo que no final das contas nem vai perceber. E também tem a questão das conquistas, a maioria é bem simples de fazer, então são conquistas bem fáceis pra você ter na sua steam.","So, I recommend the game as long as you buy it on sale, not at the regular price. Why?

- The game is cool. There are several game modes, from racing to running over zombies.

- Does it have several bugs? Yes, but nothing that won't stop you from having a few hours of fun.

- Some cars are really difficult to control; depending on your speed, you won't be able to make the turn, while the opponents take it as if it were a normal straightaway. xD

- Some cars have less than 50% health left if you blow on them. Is that annoying? Yes. But just be careful.

F3 has several bugs that could be easily fixed, including crashes during the game, but it's nothing that will stop you from playing. It's definitely worth buying the game, as long as you get a good deal. The game has several game modes, several cars, and cool skins. The game is very lightweight, any computer can run it, although it has some issues and seems to be poorly optimized. There were times when it was at 130 FPS but felt like it was under 30, I don't care. You'll play, you'll see the bugs, but you'll be so engrossed in the game that in the end you won't even notice. And there's also the issue of achievements, most of which are very simple to earn, so they're very easy to get on your Steam."

But after two rounds, I found it's actually quite good!

Compared to all that green-light garbage, it's a pretty fun game!

As for racing, there aren't any serious bugs, and the controls aren't awkward. The experience is great with instant recovery after crashing into things. You can crash into anything, and you can even use jets.

The UI is a bit crude and ugly, the maps are grimy and gray, and the collisions are a bit fake, but those aren't major issues.

Of course, I didn't spend much money; I got it as a gift or a charity gift (I forgot). Maybe my mindset is different from those who bought it at the original price of 88. I also started playing it relatively late. Maybe there were some serious bugs before?

All in all, this game is definitely not comparable to other AAA racing games, but I think it's passable as a mini-game.

I dropped the 3rd, which many reviewers say is the worst in the series. I'm here to do another review, and they're right.

Вообщем, решил я после первого и второго Флэта попробовать третий.

Запустил игру, по привычке настроился вводить настройки разрешения. Их не было - лады. 

Запускаю дальше - меня встречает русский язык. ""Ура! Теперь поглядим, как оно - играть во Флэт на русском языке!"" - сказал я.

Идём дальше. Выбираем для себя тачку. Странно, что у нас есть большой выбор БЕСПЛАТНЫХ автомобилей. Даже как-то скучно, что-ли...

И снова вперёд. Нам предлагают выбрать персонажа. Выбор теперь куда больше, иногда и забавные описания попадаются. Всем рекомендую итальянского механика!
 
Ну да ладно, пора уже что-нибудь взорвать! Ожидал взрывных дерби , крышесносных гонок, в которых есть в край оборзевшие и смышлёные соперники, забавных эвентов. А получил порцию отвратных гонок, словно вышедшие за 3 месяца от инди-разрабов. 
Гонки стали мультяшными, брутальность попросту пропала. На фоне нет божественного музла, есть только ссаная инструменталка (хотя я услышал только инструм., возможно, есть и другие песни, но мне срать, не суть).

Я проехал два поворота и решил, что этот понос надо удалять. И слава итальянскому механику, я не купил её за неполные 450 рублей (брал комплект всех игр за 149 рубасиков), иначе я бы по-просту проиграл бы с подливой.

Кароч, этот Флэт не зашёл...

1 итальянский механик из 10
","~I started the race and realized it was complete crap.~

So, after the first and second Flat Races, I decided to try the third one.

I launched the game, and out of habit, I set my sights on adjusting the resolution settings. There weren't any – fine.

I continued, and was greeted by the Russian language. ""Hooray! Now let's see what it's like to play Flat Races in Russian!"" I said.

We move on. We choose a car. It's weird that we have such a wide selection of FREE cars. It's even kind of boring, or something...

And then we move on again. We're asked to choose a character. The choice is much wider now, and sometimes the descriptions are funny. I recommend the Italian mechanic to everyone!

Oh well, time to blow something up! I was expecting explosive derbies, mind-blowing races with incredibly brazen and clever opponents, and fun events. What I got was a batch of disgusting racing games, like they were released in three months by indie developers.
The racing became cartoonish, the brutality simply vanished. There's no divine background music, just a shitty instrumental (although I only heard the instrumental; there might be other songs, but I don't care, it doesn't matter).

I drove around two corners and decided this crap needed to be removed. And thank goodness for the Italian mechanic, I didn't buy it for less than 450 rubles (I bought the full game bundle for 149 rubles), otherwise I would have simply lost.

Basically, this Flat game didn't work out...

- Ужасная физика, машина как будто примагничена к земле, а управление стало намного аркаднее. Это тоже самое, как если поиграть в Lada Racing Club после NFS Underground 1. Если в LRC физика тянула на 1 балл из 10, здесь, так и быть, можно поставить 1,5 балла. Из 10.
- Графика варьируется на уровне от 2007 до 2003 годов (я не графоёб), кое-где позорные текстуры, которые тянут на 128х128, к тому же, невероятная куча графических багов (а ведь я всего 20 минут наиграл)
- Где музон, бляtb? ГДЕ ТОТ САМЫЙ МУЗОН В СТИЛЕ 00-ЫХ, CYYYKA?

- Terrible physics, the car feels like it's stuck to the ground, and the controls are much more arcade-like. It's like playing Lada Racing Club after NFS Underground 1. If LRC's physics were a 1 out of 10, this one is a solid 1.5 out of 10.
- The graphics range from 2007 to 2003 (I'm not a graphics junkie), with some embarrassing textures that look like they're only 128x128, plus an incredible number of graphical bugs (and I only played for 20 minutes).

The wild screaming and laughter from the stupid mechanics, ""wonderful"" gameplay, and slag-like characters was guaranteed, but after an hour of playing, I wanted to puke.

29717421,english,2017.01.05 16:28,❌,✅,0.5673872232,7,"Unlike most reviewers of this game, I don't actually like FlatOut all that much. I'm more lenient towards it now than in the past but it's still not my most cherished racing franchise by far. So when I looked upon all the vitriol of FlatOut 3, I figured I could at least give it a shot since people were complaining how bad it was and I being someone who isn't a big FlatOut fan could bring less skewed perspective to the table.

NOOOOOOPE. This game is as much the car crash as everyone else has already said. FlatOut has problems but none to the degree of this pile.

To start with, the controls are completely busted. In my opinion, you can't rag on a racing game's control right out of the box. You have to take time to understand the nuances of the way the game handles before you can write it off. One of my biggest problems with FlatOut is its handling, which has a very loose and bouncy feel to it that makes it hard to predict what will happen. While troublesome, at least you could make the car do what you wanted if you were patient and meticulous with the controls. That doesn't apply here. Any driving finesse you could hope for is blown out the window thanks to cars that drift like they're on glass. Using the handbrake is an even bigger crapshoot because it spins your car 90 degrees and redirects all the momentum in the direction of the turn, which is completely awkward. In addition, the crappy controls make racing a chore because you can never seem to get a good amount of distance, having to struggle with the terrible controls more than race.

The graphics are bland (like an early Xbox 360 game) and the camera has a weird fish-eye perspective, especially when you kick in the boost, that doesn't feel natural. I get what they were going for but it would have been better just to leave it out. One fresh innovation over previous FlatOut games is the ""Ultimate Move"", which occurs when you fill up a secondary bar. When maxed, you hit the button and time slows down as well as makes your car invincible, being able to plow other cars off the track with only the slightest bump. Neat, but hardly something that makes the awful racing worthwhile. Beyond that FlatOut's signature ""plow into roadside junk and earn boost"" mechanic is still present, which is something I never really cared for in the first place (since, combined with iffy physics, you end up doing yourself a mischief while trying to energize your boost meter by hitting objects the wrong way).

One thing FlatOut has gotten right for me in the past is having a pretty good licensed soundtrack. This game has none. The menu music is just generic and, baffingly, there's no music at all when you race. Why? Part of a good racing game is having fitting music pumping in the background as you speed along. Having NOTHING is dumb as rocks.

Anyway, I didn't get very far because this game is such a junk heap. This is definitely one of the worst racing games I've played, even as someone who thinks FlatOut leaves a fair bit to be desired. I only played this because of the upcoming FlatOut 4: Total Insanity and, frankly, I wish I skipped it.","Unlike most reviewers of this game, I don't actually like FlatOut all that much.

ЧТО ЭТО? Нет, серьёзно! Что это за фигня? Третья часть Флэта? Пф... Не смешите! Какая же это третья часть Flatout? Это фигня полнейшая.

Я про графу ничего не буду говорить. Куда делась физика поведения машин на трассе? Куда делась физика повреждений? Где вмятины после столкновения с другим авто? Вмятины? Какие вмятины? Физика? Какая физика?

Теперь более подробнее:

1) Я влетел в противника на полной скорости, так его аж подбросило на километр над землёй!
2) Машина восстанавливается при ускорении. Чего? С каких пор машина вдруг восстанавливается при использовании закиси азота (оксид азота)? Ни в одном Flatout такого не было.
3) Решил поиграть в режим ""зомби"", чуть не уснул! В Armageddon Riders это делать гораздо приятнее.
4) Меня вмяли в отбойник и у меня отлетели капот и багажник. И всё?? А вмятины? Вспомните Кармагеддон, да хотя бы первую часть, помните, что становилось с машиной после нескольких десятков столкновений? А Destruction Derby? Там ведь тоже машине не сладко было после столкновений.

Лажа, а не игра. Брал в комплекте с тремя другими частями Flatout по скидке. Да она своих денег вообще не стоит, максимальная цена 1 рубль и 50 копеек.","
WHAT IS THIS? No, seriously! What the hell is this? The third Flatout? Pfft... Don't be ridiculous! What third Flatout is this? It's complete and utter garbage.

I won't even mention the graphics. Where did the physics of car behavior on the track go? Where did the damage physics go? Where are the dents after a collision with another car? Dents? What dents? Physics? What physics?

Now, in more detail:

1) I crashed into an enemy at full speed, and he was thrown a kilometer into the air!
2) The car recovers when accelerating. What? Since when does a car suddenly recover when using nitrous oxide? This has never happened in any Flatout.
3) I decided to play ""zombie"" mode, and I almost fell asleep! It's much more enjoyable to do this in Armageddon Riders.
4) I got slammed into a barrier, and my hood and trunk flew off. That's it?? And the dents? Remember Carmageddon, or at least the first one? Remember what happened to the car after dozens of collisions? And Destruction Derby? The car had a hard time after those collisions, too.

Единственная сильная сторона этой игры. Большое разнообразие машин. Да что машин, здесь есть даже ТАНК на колесах. Разнообразные карты и режимы. Хотя режим с зомби моги бы не добавлять. Довольно веселый режим на монстр-грузовиках. Различные персонажи, правда ни у кого нет особого умения.
Результат контента: 9/10

[h1]Саундтрек[/h1]
Нет. Нет... Нет! Они серьезно добавили блюз в игру по FlatOut. Разве музыка не должна быть жанра ""рок""? Мало того, что жанр музыки неудачно подобран, так она еще и без слов. Ни единого слова. И пролистать саундтрек на следующий нельзя.
Результат саундтрека: 2/10

[h1]Сообщество[/h1]
Игра оказалась настолько плохой, что не смогла собрать достойного сообщества. Хотя возможно найдутся от силы несколько игроков которым эта игра понравилась, но какой шанс их найти?
Результат сообщества: 0,5/10

[h1]Средний балл: 3,44[/h1]

[h1]Бонусы/Штрафы[/h1]
Бонус +0,05 - Эта первая игра из серии FlatOut, в которой появились достижения.
Штраф -0,1 - Сам факт того, что Bugbear продала права на серию игр уже странен. Так еще и сама компания малоизвестная. Создание игры FlatOut 3 оставило свой плохой след в истории этой компании.

[h1]Итог[/h1]
Результат: 3,44 - 0,05 = 3,39
Оценка: D","After the FlatOut series rights were handed over to Team 6, the series received its worst installment yet – FlatOut 3: Chaos & Destruction. I'll tell you just how bad this game is.

[h1]Story[/h1]
There's no story in the game, so I'll skip the rating.
Story Score: -/10

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
The graphics in this game have noticeably worsened. Even the second game had better graphics. You can't customize the graphics, only choose one of five presets, which are pretty poorly chosen. The game menu also leaves much to be desired.
Graphics Score: 2.7/10

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The physics in the game follow their own rules, as if you were playing with cardboard boxes. The nitro system was destroyed. Super-acceleration was added for some reason. The scoring system in derby is idiotic. Yes, the second game had it too, but it was better done than the third. At least they added a race customization system.
Gameplay Score: 3/10

[h1]Content[/h1]
This game's only strong point. A wide variety of cars. Not just cars, there's even a TANK on wheels. Diverse maps and modes. Although they could have done without the zombie mode. A pretty fun monster truck mode. Various characters, though none of them have any special abilities.
Content Score: 9/10

[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]
No. No... No! They seriously added blues to a FlatOut game. Shouldn't music be rock? Not only is the genre poorly chosen, but it's also wordless. Not a single word. And you can't skip to the next soundtrack. Soundtrack Score: 2/10

[h1]Community[/h1]
The game was so bad that it failed to gather a decent community. While there may be a few players who liked it, what are the chances of finding them?
Community Score: 0.5/10

[h1]Average Score: 3.44[/h1]

[h1]Bonuses/Penalties[/h1]
Bonus +0.05 - This is the first game in the FlatOut series to feature achievements.
Penalty -0.1 - The very fact that Bugbear sold the rights to the game series is strange. The company itself is also little-known. The creation of FlatOut 3 left a bad mark on this company's history.

[h1]Summary[/h1]
Score: 3.44 - 0.05 = 3.39

Купил не так давно я комплект Flatout, так как давно являлся фанатом серии, был удивлен увидив третью часть. Протер глаза, нет не показалось. Думаю играл во все еще давно и на пиратке, а тут FLATOUT 3, мать его. Отбросил играть в CS: GO и сразу стал устанавливать эту ""великолепную"" игру. Установка прошла успешно. Заходим. Ооооооооооо черт. А не... это всего лишь меню. По моему в первой части и то было лучше. Ну думаю не судить ведь игру только по меню, сразу без раздумий решил начать карьеру, к моему удивлению ее там не оказалось. Ну думаю не беда, но обидно. Ладно давайте гонку уже я хочу крушить все на своем пути, будто я бульдозер на стройке, или бабушка в автобусе, или таксист на дороге, или я.... А пофиг короче. Загрузка прошла и вот я вижу сие творение. Что это? -спросил мозг. Это не Flatout. Это что то в стиле Need for Russia, кто в теме тот поймёт. Пройдя гонку я понял, может это только мое мнение, но как помне это полный шлак за который даже пиратку бы качать не стал. После заезда я передал геймпад другу Евгению. После того как он проехал тот же самый трек, он сказал что игра ""хорошая"" только вместо этого прилагательного было использованна короткая абривеатура детородного органа(он же член, ну если кто не понял).
+Плюсы+
-Пока не нашел, найду подправлю описание

-Минусы-
-Сама игра","Good day, guys and gals. I recently bought a Flatout set, having been a long-time fan of the series, and was surprised to see the third part. I rubbed my eyes, no, I wasn't imagining things. I think I played it all a long time ago and on a pirated copy, and then here comes FLATOUT 3, damn it. I stopped playing CS:GO and immediately started installing this ""magnificent"" game. The installation was successful. We log in. Oh, damn. Oh, no... it's just a menu. In my opinion, the first game was even better. Well, I guess you can't judge a game by its menu alone, so without a second thought, I decided to start a career, and to my surprise, it wasn't there. Well, no big deal, I guess, but it's a shame. Okay, let's start the race already! I want to smash everything in my path, like I'm a bulldozer at a construction site, or an old lady on a bus, or a taxi driver on the road, or me... But whatever. The loading process is complete, and here I am, seeing this creation. What is this? my brain asked. This isn't Flatout. It's something in the style of Need for Russia; those in the know will understand. After completing the race, I realized—maybe it's just my opinion, but as I recall, it's complete garbage, and I wouldn't even bother downloading a pirated copy for it. After the race, I passed the controller to my friend Evgeny. After he drove the same track, he said the game was ""good,"" except instead of that adjective, they used a short abbreviation for a penis (aka penis, in case anyone didn't get it).
+Pros+

28424093,english,2016.11.17 16:31,❌,✅,0.5,0,"I've played this for a little bit on Offline Mode (I think), so I had to have the misfortune of playing this thing for another 6 minutes, which is much more time than this game deserves.

This game is absolutely pathetic. To think that it carries the name FlatOut, a series that I've grown up with ever since I first played FlatOut 2, sickens me to my core. I genuinely feel bad for Bugbear, since their former IP was turned into...well, this.

But how much damage has Team6 caused? Let's go into detail:

The graphics are abysmal. Everything has this hideous red-orange lighting all over it, and it just feels horrible - it's not easy on the eyes at all. FlatOut 1's graphics are far more appealing than this, because, well, it actually knew how to light enviroments properly. My game was slightly laggy for the most part, but it froze for a full two seconds at one point - something that the first two (technically three) FlatOuts, nor Wreckfest have ever caused. So yeah. This game ain't pretty looking.

The gameplay, too, is horrible. I remember having an absolute blast with FlatOut 2's gameplay, playing Water Canal 2 and having the Flatmobile soar around and destroying practically everything - itself included. To put it simply, it was very exciting. This is not. I could only feel a tiny flicker of the fun I've felt with FlatOut 1, 2 and UC, at best. Overall, it just leaves me dead inside. I can just feel the blandness emitting from it and trying to infect me. The game often feels invasive in that sense. I played Stunt Man mode at one point, and I couldn't even get past the second ""challenge"", which I should call ""impossible task"". The word challenge implies that you can actually perform the task, but after much difficulty. The second challenge, with the giant hill, I can't get past whatsoever.
Oh, and it has a zombie mode, which just goes to show how absolutely little Team6 knows what made the original FlatOut games good.

The physics are also horrific. It feels much less like a FlatOut game, with realistic yet very fun physics (if that even sounds right), and more like a racing game on an arcade machine...at the *absolute* best. In the original games, cars actually felt like...well, cars. You could simply feel the smashing and crashing easily. They felt like they had weight - even the ragdoll drivers felt like they had more weight than this. This just feels like you're driving some weird balloon cars.

The sound design is terrible, too. The car engine sounds sound incredibly fake, not even on the standards of RC cars - which is a huge contrast to the original games' realistic sound design. I was playing as the Unknown Player (apparently Team6 couldn't think of any more rubbish character ideas), and the ragdoll voice does not at all fit - it sounds like a horny chick.

The AI, though, is one of the worst aspects. At least the AI in the previous games knew what they were actually doing - racing. Here, the CPU racers apparently didn't care much about racing and decided to just do whatever. And the AI characters - it truly speaks volumes when you can memorize all the AI characters in FO2, yet you can only remember two in this one - one is the Unknown Player, and that's literally only because of his name, and that he has a helmet, and the other one is that one Santa costume wearing chick. Seriously.

I believe I've covered everything, so allow me to conclude with this: Do not buy this game. Ever. And don't buy the FlatOut bundle either, because it has this garbage with it. Go play the first two FlatOuts, or Ultimate Carnage, or Wreckfest, all of which were made by Bugbear - y'know, devs that know what they're doing. I mean, I would even recommend Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing - despite that it isn't on Steam. That's because you can have some semblance of fun with how utterly broken it is. FlatOut 3 is just sad, hugely disrespectful towards the once-proud franchise.

And the worst part is that it's not only a mindblowing 11 gigabytes, but it's also 75% off as of this writing. Its full price is like 30 dollars, which is even more than the original games. I can only ask one thing: why?

I seriously wish I could refund this game, but since I bought the FlatOut bundle, that would mean erasing the good FO games as well. So I'm just gonna let this thing lie and rot, and wait for a Steam gift card for Christmas, or something.

Anyway, yeah. In quick summary, go wreck Jason Walker's car instead of flying around aimlessly as the girly-voiced, boneless, humanoid-shaped spaghetti creature known as the Unknown Player.

[quote=Илья Мэддисон] Только не говорите моей девушке, что они сделали с Flatout'ом, это была её любимая игра[/quote]

[h1]Предыстория[/h1]

Когда то был Flatout. Самый-самый первый. Одна из самых захватывающих гонок с массовым разрушением автомобилей. Режим с круглой ареной, где творилась полнейшая анархия. Испытания в виде боулинга, дартса и многих других забав, где снарядом служил водитель авто. И, конечно же, карьера, в которой был прекрасная система тюнинга, достаточно большой автопарк.
  
Был Flatout 2. И он был в разы круче первого, хоть и на ностальгических чувствах теперь играет слабее. Те же режимы, те же фишки с разрушением, даже карты из первой части завезли. Отличалась разве что новыми, интересными по построению картами, классами машин и специальными кубками для каждого класса. Ну, и водители теперь не безликие женщины с мужчинами, а персонажи с именем/фамилией и краткой биографией. 

[h1]Обзор[/h1]

Но, по закону наследования генов, в семье не без урода. И как же жаль, что этим ""уродом"" оказалась самая ожидаемая часть Flatout (третья номерная), а ждали её целых 5 лет (делаю акцент ""целых 5 лет"" потому, что между 1 и 2 частями Flatout прошел год-полтора, в зависимости от даты релиза в разных регионах). Получили, как вы понимаете, смачную такую кекеху. Убрали самый интересный режим-карьера. Тюнинг сошел на нет, теперь всё заменено на сборки с максимально кратким описанием. Под видом ""новых захватывающих режимов"" нам впаривают всё те же круглые арены, где задачей является уничтожение противников, испытания в боулинге и других видах спорта, ЗОМБИ-режим, который в игре такого рода кажется ненужным, и еще около 5 режимов, в которые играть отпадает всякое желание.

[h1]Итог[/h1]
BugBear совершили колоссальную ошибку, отдав разработку в совершенно чужие руки, они поставили крест на адекватном продолжении замечательной гоночной игры.

[quote=Ilya Maddison] Just don't tell my girlfriend what they did to Flatout, it was her favorite game[/quote]

[h1]Backstory[/h1]

There was Flatout once. The very first one. One of the most exciting racing games with massive car destruction. A round arena mode where complete anarchy reigned. Challenges in the form of bowling, darts, and many other games where the driver served as the projectile. And, of course, a career mode with an excellent tuning system and a fairly large car fleet.

There was Flatout 2. And it was much better than the first one, although it's a bit weaker now due to nostalgia. The same modes, the same destruction features, even the maps from the first game were brought back. The only differences were new, interestingly designed maps, car classes, and special trophies for each class. And drivers are no longer faceless men and women, but characters with first and last names and short biographies.

[h1]Review[/h1]

But, as the law of genetic inheritance goes, there's always a black sheep in every family. And what a shame that ""black sheep"" turned out to be the most anticipated Flatout installment (the third one), which we waited for five years (I emphasize ""five years"" because a year and a half passed between Flatout 1 and 2, depending on the release date in different regions). What we got, as you can imagine, was a real bummer. The most interesting career mode was removed. Tuning has disappeared, now everything has been replaced by builds with the briefest possible description. Under the guise of ""exciting new modes,"" we're being sold the same old circular arenas where the goal is to destroy opponents, challenges in bowling and other sports, a ZOMBIE mode that seems unnecessary in a game of this type, and about five more modes that make it completely undesirable.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
BugBear made a colossal mistake by handing over development to completely unrelated hands; they've put an end to a viable sequel to a wonderful racing game.

Самая унылая и ужасная игра серии FlatOut. Ни при каких условиях не запускайте эту игру на своих ПК, слышите? Это просто отстой! В ней нет ничего, что может приносить удовольствие.

Плюсы всё таки у игры есть:
-начать читать обзоры и прислушиваться к мнению окружающих;
-все, что пишут в обзорах про это недоразумение;
-разработчиков настигнет кармическое наказание за содеянный акт вандализма и насилия над прекрасным шедевром из детства;

Минусов конечно же больше:
-это не игра; (она не должна называться FlatOut, это просто оскорбление франшизы)
-звук; (в игре нет нормальных музыкальных треков и звуки происходящего на экране просто бесят)
-графика; (точней ее отсутвие, как таковой. По карте разъезжают деревянные коробки с модельками от машин, все некрасиво взрывается, главное меню тусклое и мыльное а выкрутив все настройки на 100% ничего не изменится)
-геймплей;(ужасные трассы и испорченные халатностью разработчиков игровые режимы. Добавили режим, где нужно давить зомби, это просто trash)
-мультиплеер; (как и следовало ожидать, в это никто не играет, и скорее всего с момента выхода)
-название; (данный продукт не должен распространяться под названием FlatOut, дабы не использовать рекламу франшизы и не омрачнять всю серию подобной поделкой)
-разработчик; (над разработкой игры глумилась малоизвестная студия Team6 Game Studios, которая известа своими неудачными и провальными проектами)
-цена; (это просто смачный сморчок в сторону потребителя, причем я говорю о скидке в 97% )
-существование; (необходимо создать инквизицию по устранению и сжиганию подобного суррогата)
-вес; (данный продукт по неизвестным мне причинам весит около 10гб, что никоем образом не может укладываться в моей голове)
-интерес взял свое; (я проклял тот день, когда почитал эти крайне отрицательные отзывы и всё же решил взглянуть, а чего там такого плохого? зря я это сделал)

Итог: даже не пытайтесь пропустить через себя данную продукцию и не вздумайте принести денег этому разработчику. Всё чего эта игра достойна - забвения... Нет такого места во Вселенной, куда ей нужно уйти.

Удачи!","Flatout 3: Chaos & Destruction

The most depressing and terrible game in the FlatOut series. Do not, under any circumstances, play this game on your PC, do you hear me? It's just crap! There's nothing enjoyable about it.

The game does have its pros:
-start reading reviews and listening to others;
-everything written in reviews is a misunderstanding;
-the developers will suffer karmic punishment for this act of vandalism and violence against a beautiful childhood masterpiece;

The cons, of course, outweigh the others:
-this isn't a game; (it shouldn't be called FlatOut, that's just an insult to the franchise)
-sound; (there are no proper music tracks in the game, and the sounds onscreen are simply infuriating)
-graphics; (or rather, the lack thereof, as such. Wooden boxes with model cars drive around the map, everything explodes ugly, the main menu is dull and blurry, and turning all the settings to 100% doesn't change anything)
-gameplay; (terrible tracks and game modes ruined by the developers' negligence. They added a mode where you crush zombies, it's just trash)
-multiplayer; (as expected, no one plays this, and most likely since its release)
-name; (this product should not be distributed under the name FlatOut, so as not to use advertising for the franchise and to avoid tarnishing the entire series with such a piece of junk)
-developer; (the game's development was mocked by the little-known Team6 Game Studios, known for its unsuccessful and disastrous projects)
-price; (this is simply a juicy taunt aimed at the consumer, and I'm talking about a 97% discount)
-existence; (An inquisition must be created to eliminate and burn such surrogates.)
-weight; (For reasons unknown to me, this product weighs in at about 10GB, which I can't wrap my head around.)
-interest got the better of me; (I cursed the day I read those extremely negative reviews and finally decided to check it out. What's so bad about it? I should have done that.)

Bottom line: don't even try to play this product and don't even think about bringing money to this developer. All this game deserves is oblivion... There's no place in the universe it should go.

Всё началось с меню и его настроек. Как только я запустил игру, то по одним лишь только буквам я понял что игру будто бы растянули с 360p до FullHD. Даже в самой первой игре было гораздо больше настроек графики, и даже там картинка была лучше. Здесь же реальное мыло с эфектом блеска от вазилина после того как разработчика насиловали несколько лет неондертальцы при помощи своих палок-убивалок. Физики тут нет и в помине. Да блин, в FlatOut 2 физика не то что лучше... Это как сравнивать фильмы Кубрика и Хичкока с фильмами (простите что назвал его высер - фильмами) Сарика Андреасяна. Я случайно задел машину, а та начал плясать в взывать богов в воздухе будто ей из обреза стрельнули в брюхо. А при первом же повороте, моя машина подхватила лихорадку и начала отплясывать видимо самому Фюреру во хвалу ему.  А музыка!? ГДЕ ЧЁРТ ВОЗЬМИ МУЗЫКА!!!

I read the reviews and thought, ""It can't be that bad""... I was wrong. It all started with the menu and its settings. As soon as I launched the game, just by looking at the text, I realized it was upscaled from 360p to FullHD. Even the very first game had way more graphics settings, and even there the picture was better. This one is pure soap with a Vaseline shine effect after the developer was raped for several years by Neanderthals with their killing sticks. There's no physics here at all. Damn, the physics in FlatOut 2 aren't even that good... It's like comparing Kubrick and Hitchcock films with the films (sorry for calling him crap - films) of Sarik Andreasyan. I accidentally hit a car, and it started dancing and calling out to the gods in the air, as if it had been shot in the gut with a sawed-off shotgun. And at the very first turn, my car caught a fever and started dancing, apparently in praise of the Fuhrer himself. And the music!? WHERE THE HELL IS THE MUSIC!!! I bought these games because nostalgia took hold of me when I heard Rise Against - Give it All. Okay, I have no complaints about the previous games, even the English language only enhances the feelings. But here there is nothing at all. I've only been in the game for 5 minutes, and my ass will be blown away for a looooong time. You shouldn't buy this game. In fact, NEVER BUY IT!!! Actually, no. You can buy it for your ex or your worst enemy. They don't deserve it, but they'll get the hint. Thanks for ruining the game. It's like the fourth Batman movie from Schumacher.

26059365,brazilian,2016.09.16 04:23,❌,✅,0.5093457699,1,"Jogo completamente quebrado, cheio de falhas. 

Joguei por incontáveis horas os dois primeiros jogos da franquia, e fiquei animado ao saber que existia um FlatOut 3.
Assim que comecei a jogar, reparei que o dano dos carros não era realista como costumava ser (nos games anteriores, o amassado da lataria correspondia ao local de colisão com o carro. Aqui, foi diferente) e me senti extremamente incomodado conforme os minutos iam passado. Eis algumas outras esquisitices:

- No modo Derby, que é individual (free-for-all), deixou claro que a IA do game está focada apenas no jogador e não nos outros. Assim que você se aproxima da limitação do mapa, os oponentes vinham te pressionar contra a parede quase que instantaneamente, tornando esse modo ridículo e chato de jogar.

- Alguns oponentes travavam em pontos específicos no mapa e não conseguiam sair.

- Ao bater levemente em certas paredes, o carro buga e é arremessado para longe. Quando a batida era frontal (mesmo que leve), o motorista era arremessado pelo parabrisa. 

- O modo de corrida é extremamente irritante devido ao bug citado anteriormente. Imagine uma dúzia de carros empurrando você contra  um mísero poste ou árvore e o seu carro explodindo. Isso acontecia inúmeras vezes.

Só não consegui detectar mais problemas porque não tive condições de continuar. Apesar de fazer mais de 10 anos após jogar o primeiro FlatOut, eu sabia que o terceiro tinha nada a ver com a essência que a franquia estabeleceu. Tirando o fato de não merecer o nome, o jogo não cumpre com as mecânicas de games de corrida.

","A completely broken game, full of glitches.

I played countless hours of the first two games in the franchise, and I was excited to learn that there was a FlatOut 3.
As soon as I started playing, I noticed that the car damage wasn't as realistic as it used to be (in previous games, the dent in the bodywork corresponded to the collision location with the car. This one was different), and I felt extremely uncomfortable as the minutes passed. Here are some other oddities:

- In Derby mode, which is a single-player (free-for-all), it was clear that the game's AI is focused only on the player and not on others. As soon as you approached the map's limit, opponents would rush you against the wall almost instantly, making this mode ridiculous and boring to play.

- Some opponents would get stuck in specific spots on the map and couldn't get out.

- When lightly hitting certain walls, the car would glitch and be thrown away. When the collision was head-on (even a light one), the driver would be thrown through the windshield.

- The racing mode is extremely annoying due to the aforementioned bug. Imagine a dozen cars pushing you into a single pole or tree and your car exploding. This happened countless times.

I couldn't detect more problems because I couldn't continue. Despite playing the first FlatOut more than 10 years ago, I knew the third game had nothing to do with the essence the franchise established. Aside from the fact that it doesn't deserve its name, the game doesn't live up to the mechanics of a racing game.

Полки магазинов пестрели незамысловатыми аркадами и «взрослыми» симуляторами с именами знаменитых гонщиков на обложках, а любители устраивать «ад на колесах» могли утолить жажду разрушений разве что в GTA. И вдруг в нашу жизнь на бешеной скорости влетел яркий болид под названием FlatOut, вобравший в себя самые сливки: если гонять, то со всей дури, если крушить — то всё и в хлам!
Режим «Арена» отправлял в автомобильную Преисподнюю, где «железные кони», не щадя наездников, сходились в смертельном поединке. Кольцевые заезды превращались в гонки на выживание, где уцелеть было сложнее, чем доехать до финиша первым. А мини-игры предлагали забаву «проломи водителем лобовое стекло». Развеселая физика, покореженные тачки, сумасшедшая скорость и запредельная динамика: пресловутый «фан» тек рекой. FlatOut представлял собой острейшее блюдо, в котором соуса «чили» было больше, чем самой пищи.

Появившийся в 2006-м сиквел закрепил успех оригинала, заметно подтянул графику и физическую модель, хотя в игровом процессе существенных изменений не наблюдалось. Увы, но на FlatOut 2 керосин у разработчиков закончился. Спустя два года последовал FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage — ремейк второй части для Xbox 360, позднее перенесенный обратно на PC – вторичный и утративший прежний блеск в глазах.

«Ничего, — думали игроки. — Третья часть не подведет»...

FlatOut 3? Нет, не слышал
В начале декабря (аккурат за неделю до релиза) грянул раскатистый гром: фанаты неожиданно узнали, что FlatOut 3 вот-вот выйдет, а его разработку ведут кавалеры трэша третьей степени из голландской Team6. Все десять лет своего существования они старательно продвигали в массы постулат «худшее — друг плохого», лепя из одного и того же теста игры одну другой «краше». Опасения, что и в этот раз студия все испортит, подкрепил страшненький трейлер...

Меню изобилует режимами, автопарк соблазняет широким перечнем классов, а трассы интригуют разнообразием: тут вам и казахские степи, и ледяные озера, и много других мест, обещающих неописуемые красоты.

Но стоит нажать на кнопку «старт», и по глазам бьет не адреналин, а бампер от КамАЗа: графика не просто чудаковатая, она еще и опоздала на несколько лет — даже во FlatOut 2 обертка была симпатичнее. Чтобы замаскировать это недоразумение, трудолюбивые авторы решили восполнить недостатки движка лошадиными дозами блюра, блума и разлетающихся искр. В итоге получилась нелепая, бушующая всеми цветами радуги размазня, которая даже у здорового человека рискует вызвать эпилептический припадок. Спи спокойно, советский телевизор «Рекорд» 1976 года выпуска с севшим кинескопом! Твои незабываемые цвета воспели игроделы из Team6. 

Сумасшедшие гонки на высоких скоростях — кровь и плоть серии — превратились в нудные, слепленные на скорую руку марафоны. В раллийных заездах проще простого заблудиться среди сотен кривых хижин, не найдя правильного пути. В битвах на аренах из-за постоянных столкновений экран пестрит тысячами искр, отчего разглядеть происходящее почти невозможно. И забудьте о просчете траектории в мини-играх с вылетом через лобовое стекло.

Армагеддон откладывается до лучших времен
Если общая картинка нарисована цифровым импрессионистом, почему бы и машинам не «отличиться»? Во FlatOut 3 они, похоже, сделаны из пластмассы: малейшее столкновение — и противник подлетает вверх как воздушный шарик, или летит кубарем. Могучие внедорожники на маленьких ухабах подпрыгивают метра на два, а легковушке даже простой поворот руля грозит полной потерей управления. Понятное дело, и в изначальной дилогии физика не отличалась реалистичностью, но тут авторы явно перестарались и даже простая задача «хоть как-то доехать до финиша» стала серьезной проблемой.
Странно ведут себя и разрушаемые объекты. Столбы, мусорные баки и прочие предметы разлетаются при столкновении так, будто гонки происходят в невесомости. Живи Ньютон в мире FlatOut 3, он вряд ли открыл бы закон всемирного тяготения: яблоко могло полететь не вниз, а куда-нибудь вбок, по странной траектории, понятной только создателям физической модели игры.

Завершает всю эту чудную (ударение поставьте сами) картину предельно дурацкий просчет повреждений. Если вы врежетесь во вражеский автомобиль, он получит три процента урона, а ваш — все десять. Смысл в таких маневрах может разглядеть разве что самоубийца.

Моя оценка 3/10
","It was the racing year of 2004. The thermonuclear era of Carmageddon seemed to have vanished forever. Store shelves were filled with simple arcade games and ""grown-up"" simulators featuring famous racers on the covers, and those who enjoyed creating ""hell on wheels"" could only satisfy their thirst for destruction with GTA. And then, suddenly, a flashy racing car called FlatOut hurtled into our lives at breakneck speed, embracing the very best: if you race, you go all out, if you smash, you destroy everything!
The ""Arena"" mode sent you into a car hellscape, where ""iron horses,"" showing no mercy to their riders, clashed in mortal combat. Circuit races turned into endurance races, where surviving was more difficult than reaching the finish line first. Minigames offered the thrill of ""drive through the windshield."" Hilarious physics, mangled cars, insane speed, and off-the-charts action: the proverbial ""fun"" flowed like water. FlatOut was a spicier dish, with more chili sauce than food.

The sequel, released in 2006, cemented the original's success, significantly improving the graphics and physics, though the gameplay remained largely unchanged. Alas, the developers ran out of fuel with FlatOut 2. Two years later, FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage, a remake of the second game for Xbox 360 and later ported back to PC, followed—a derivative effort that lost its former sparkle.

""Never mind,"" players thought. ""The third game won't let us down.""

FlatOut 3? No, I haven't heard.
In early December (just a week before the release), a thunderclap sounded: fans unexpectedly learned that FlatOut 3 was about to be released, and that it was being developed by the Dutch team Team6, the masters of trash. For ten years, they'd been diligently promoting the maxim ""the worst is the friend of the bad,"" churning out one game after another, one better than the other, from the same dough. Fears that the studio would screw things up again were reinforced by a terrifying trailer...

The menu is replete with modes, the vehicle fleet entices with a wide range of classes, and the tracks are intriguingly diverse: you'll find the Kazakh steppes, icy lakes, and many other places promising indescribable beauty.

But as soon as you press the start button, it's not the adrenaline that hits your eyes, but the bumper of a KamAZ truck: the graphics are not only quirky, they're also several years late—even FlatOut 2 had a prettier wrapper. To mask this oversight, the hard-working developers decided to compensate for the engine's shortcomings with massive doses of blur, bloom, and flying sparks. The result is a ridiculous, rainbow-colored mess that could even trigger an epileptic seizure in a healthy person. Sleep tight, Soviet ""Rekord"" TV from 1976 with a dead CRT! Your unforgettable colors have been celebrated by the game developers at Team6.

The crazy high-speed races—the lifeblood of the series—have turned into tedious, hastily assembled marathons. In rally races, it's easy to get lost among hundreds of crooked huts, unable to find the right path. In arena battles, the constant collisions fill the screen with thousands of sparks, making it almost impossible to see what's happening. And forget about calculating the trajectory in minigames that involve flying through the windshield.

Armageddon is postponed until better times
If the overall picture is painted by a digital impressionist, why shouldn't the cars ""distinguish themselves""? In FlatOut 3, they seem made of plastic: the slightest collision and the enemy flies into the air like a balloon, or tumbles head over heels. Mighty SUVs bounce two meters over small bumps, while even a simple turn of the steering wheel threatens to completely spin out of control for a passenger car. Of course, the physics in the original duology weren't particularly realistic, but here the developers clearly overdid it, and even the simple task of ""somehow reaching the finish line"" became a serious challenge.
Destructible objects also behave strangely. Poles, trash cans, and other objects fly apart upon impact, as if the race were taking place in zero gravity. If Newton had lived in the world of FlatOut 3, he would hardly have discovered the law of gravity: the apple might have flown not downwards, but sideways, along a strange trajectory understood only by the creators of the game's physics model.

To top off this whole bizarre (insert the emphasis yourself) picture, there's an incredibly stupid damage calculation. If you crash into an enemy car, they'll take 3% damage, and yours will take a full 10%. Only a suicidal person could see the point of such maneuvers.

My rating: 3/10

Вроде и FlatOut, но с какой-то  странной графикой, местами видны ошибки моделирования - например в испытании, где выбрасывается водитель и нужно поразить цель, как в ""Дартсе"" - там одежда цепляется за машину и тянется шлейфом за игроком весь полёт.
Если во FlatOut 2 были чётко проработанные модели машин и окружающий мир, то здесь всё упрощено и не доработано.
В общем, самая главная ""фишка"" FlatOut - разрушение машин и всего, что вокруг - оставляет желать лучшего...
Несмотря на такое громкое название -""Хаос и разрушение"" - игра не понравилась вообще!

","This is some kind of fake!
It's kind of like FlatOut, but the graphics are weird, and there are some modeling errors here and there—for example, in the challenge where the driver is thrown out and you have to hit a target, like in Darts—their clothes get caught on the car and trail behind the player the entire flight.
While FlatOut 2 had clearly detailed car models and the surrounding world, here everything is simplified and unpolished.
Overall, FlatOut's main feature—the destruction of cars and everything around them—leaves much to be desired...
Despite the grandiose name—""Chaos and Destruction""—I didn't like the game at all!

1) There's Russian. No need to search...
2) The graphics made me cry.
CONS
1) And most importantly. The maximum graphics in this game are on par with Android 1.1 or even the old Siemens S6.
2) Equally important. You're not controlling a car, but a pack of cigarettes washing down a drain. No drifting or anything approaching reality. Everything is incredibly stupid! Wherever you point, it rolls.

Она на столько плоха и убога что через 15 мин игры есть большой шанс впасть в дипрессию а через 30мин в кому.

It's so bad and pathetic that after 15 minutes of play, there's a good chance you'll fall into depression, and after 30 minutes, into a coma. The graphics are straight out of the 90s, the controls evoke a sense of surprise and then laughter, the car performs incredible somersaults and completely disobeys the gamepad. The game is so wretched it could cause a shift in the space-time continuum. But this game still manages to do one thing: disgrace the proud name of Flatout. Even if the developers of the first two games had nothing to do with this hack job. This is one of those cases where the publisher should be ashamed of such garbage. 0 blown-up cars out of 10."

A very incompetent company. There's no point in dividing my review into pros and cons because there are no pros. The game is completely riddled with flaws and shortcomings. The graphics are simply terrible due to the excessive blooming and incomprehensible image jerkiness, so people with epilepsy should avoid this ""masterpiece."" In general, everyone should avoid this game, if you can call it that. As for the gameplay, it's not far removed from the graphics. The map is full of objects, and when the car collides with them, it barely reacts or changes its trajectory. The cars handle terribly, the physics are wooden, and it's unclear how the car will react in the next second—whether it'll drive 10 meters up a wall or simply disappear into the textures.

Ich hab ja nicht geglaubt, daß dieser Titel so schlecht ist. 
Die Vorgänger waren klasse, hab ich mir gesagt. 
Die Vorgänger haben mir ein Grinsen aufs Gesicht gezaubert, hab ich mir gesagt.
Da kann man die Serie doch gar nicht so komplett gegen die Wand fahren, hab ich mir gesagt.
Pustekuchen!
Dieser Schrottplatz ist das mit Abstand grottigste Rennspiel, das mir je untergekommen ist (Pitstop auf dem C64 eingeschlossen).

Aber was bietet ""Flatout 3"" eigentlich? Viele Rennmodi, Destruction Derby, Monster Trucks, Speed Challenges, Stunt-Modi, natürlich normale Rennen, Offroad-Action und noch einiges mehr.  Zahlreiche (nicht lizensierte) Wagen aus den verschiedensten Klassen mit Repaints, dazu verschiedene (rein optisch unterschiedliche Fahrer. Fünfzig Herausforderungen aus den verschiedensten Bereichen und in einem Modus dürfen wir Zombies möglichst in Combos zermantschen.

Klingt lustig? 
Von wegen. 

""Chaos & Destruction"": Der Titel ist Programm. Die ganze Spielmechanik ist destruktives Chaos. Die Fahrphysik ist unterirdisch, die Fahrzeuge sind durchweg kaum kontrollierbar, Wheelsupport existiert natürlich nicht. Dazu kommt eine nicht vorhandene KI und das Prinzip, daß sich die Autos gerne mal bei Kontakt ineinander verkeilen. Ich bin schonmal eine geschlagene halbe Runde mit nem Kollegen auf dem Dach rumgefahren. Die Gegner kommen auch ansonsten mit den Strecken nicht zurecht. Besonders witzig bei Speed-Runs zu sehen, wo das gesamte Feld nach einer langen Gerade die Kurve einfach nicht kriegt und kollektiv abfliegt. 

Die Formel-Rennen sind eh völlig absurd. Natürlich muß bei einem Crash-Titel nicht alles realistisch sein, daß man mit seinem Boliden im Gras allerdings auch fröhlich 300 fahren kann, er dafür aber nicht um die Kurve kommt, ist einfach nur iditotisch. Die Strecken sind strunzlangweilig gebaut, das Balancing schwebt irgendwo im All, die Aufgaben sind repetetiv, so etwas wie eine Karriere gibt es erst gar nicht und die Kameraführung ist natürlich genau so, daß man etwa bei den Stunts überhaupt nichts sieht, außer der eigenen Figur.

Auch technisch befinden wir uns im tiefsten Atomschutzkeller. Die Grafik ist das Häßlichste was mir in dem Genre je untergekommen ist, passend dazu der Brechreiz erzeugende Soundtrack der geschmacklosen Beliebigkeit. Dafür kommen die Karren nicht an den realistischer klingenden Singer-Sound von 1914 ran (ja, ich spreche von der Nähmaschine).

Alles, wirklich alles hat schon das sehr unterhaltsame ""Flatout 1"" Jahre vorher um mehrere Klassen besser gemacht.

I didn't believe this title was that bad.

The predecessors were great, I told myself.

The predecessors put a smile on my face, I told myself.

You can't really drive the series into the ground like that, I told myself.


No way!
This junkyard is by far the worst racing game I've ever seen (including Pitstop on the C64).


But what does ""Flatout 3"" actually offer? Plenty of racing modes, Destruction Derby, Monster Trucks, Speed ​​Challenges, Stunt modes, of course, regular races, off-road action, and much more. Numerous (unlicensed) cars from a variety of classes with repaints, plus various (purely visually different) drivers. Fifty challenges from a wide variety of disciplines, and in one mode, we can smash zombies into combos as best we can.

Sounds fun?
Not at all.

""Chaos & Destruction"": The title says it all. The entire game mechanics are destructive chaos. The driving physics are abysmal, the vehicles are almost impossible to control, and wheel support is nonexistent, of course. Added to that is the nonexistent AI and the fact that the cars tend to jam into each other upon contact. I once rode around on the roof with a colleague for a full half lap. The opponents generally don't have the skills to handle the tracks. It's especially funny to see during speed runs, where the entire field just can't make the turn after a long straight and flies off the track.

The Formula races are completely absurd anyway. Of course, not everything in a crash title has to be realistic, so you can't control it with your car. The fact that a car can happily do 300 km/h on the grass, but can't turn a corner, is simply idiotic. The tracks are incredibly boring, the balancing is floating somewhere in space, the tasks are repetitive, there's no such thing as a career, and the camera work is, of course, such that you can't see anything at all during stunts except your own character.

Technically, we're also in the depths of a nuclear shelter. The graphics are the ugliest I've ever seen in this genre, and the tasteless, arbitrary soundtrack is just as fitting. On the other hand, the cars can't compare to the more realistic Singer soundtrack from 1914 (yes, I'm talking about the sewing machine).

Everything, absolutely everything, was already done several notches better by the very entertaining ""Flatout 1"" years earlier.

It completely ruined all the good impressions I had from the first two games. The physics in this game are worse than in the previous version of Flatout 2, there's no campaign at all, and the modes are all the same, just with the addition of half-baked zombies where they stand and wait to be run over. This is the most ridiculous racing game I've ever seen. I went into a derby, and there were no ""bang,"" no ""boom,"" no ""bang,"" no ""hooligan"" (anyone who played the second game will understand)—just 24 cars, all beating each other to score points. The point of surviving a derby is already lost. The car selection is very limited and meager: there are no divisions into classes like ""derby,"" ""racing,"" or ""street racing."" The division into classes is now just passenger cars and coupes. I highly recommend against this game, especially for those who played the previous games—it'll make your eyes bleed, though I only got blood from my nose. I could go on and on about the game's flaws and what they messed up, and that's just after 20 minutes of play (10 of which was spent reading character descriptions). Just think about how much negativity there is in that short time. I read the other reviews, and most of them have similar opinions, and they haven't even played an hour... With this game, the developers have simply buried their good name and ruined all the glory of Flatout. That's all.

The controls are terrible; you can't make a simple lap without using the handbrake. Besides, it's almost impossible to finish first (the only race I played, I barely managed to finish first), the AI ​​is very poorly programmed, there's no background music, the main menu is somewhat confusing, and so on.

The only thing I see as a standout is the damage system; it's a bit more realistic now. Still, one positive point will never outweigh the many negative points.

My recommendation is a definitive NO. This game may also be included in the Ultimate Pack, but I think it's better to get the other three without it. I got it this way; thank goodness it was on sale."

Myslím, že každý fanoušek série FlatOut pocítil zklamání při koupi trojky. Vím, že mám ve friendlistu dost fanoušků Flat Outů, takže tady je pár důvodů, proč si Chaos and Destruction nekoupit...

1) Absence kariéry. Kde jsou ty časy, kdy se auta kupovala a tunila. Ve trojce se auta odemykají za výsledky. Ve hře vlastně nemůžete dosáhnout nějakého viditelného postupu...
2) Grafika... Spíš než na 4. díl populární hry to vypadá na nějakou open alphu... Auto se od drátěného plotu dokáže odrazit neuvěřitelně vysoko.
3) Ovladatelnost... Haha... Chybí...
4) Zvuky... Zní to kompletně, jako nadabované nějakým týpkem v garáži. Jinak si ty pazvuky vysvětlit nedokážu.
V podstatě bych jí místo kategorie ""Racing"" přisoudil kategorii ""Uninstall simulator"". Ale uninstall simulátor za 30€ je to maličko předražený...","Touching or sad pictures often appear on the web... I think that showing people the FlatOut 3 poster makes everyone cry to this day. I think every fan of the FlatOut series felt the disappointment of buying a triple. I know I have quite a few Flat Out fans on my friendlist, so here are a few reasons not to buy Chaos and Destruction...

1) Absence of a career. Where are the days when cars were bought and tuned. In threes, cars are unlocked for results. You can't actually make any visible progress in the game...
2) Graphics... Rather than the 4th part of the popular game, it looks like an open alpha... The car can bounce incredibly high from the wire fence.
3) Maneuverability... Haha... Missing...
4) Sounds... It totally sounds like it was dubbed by some guy in a garage. Otherwise, I can't explain the undertones.
Basically, instead of the ""Racing"" category, I would assign it the ""Uninstall simulator"" category. But an uninstall simulator for €30 is a little overpriced..."

You start at easy races, and then as your player gets ""skills"" you continue to make the races harder until he is racing almost perfect lines 

Flatout 3: Chaos and Destruction doesn't seem to agree with this.  It gives the player options of modes to play.  There's a lot of variety here, that would be a good thing.  The problem is the difficulty of this game is extreme.  There's no tutorial, and the game just is very hard.  If you turn the difficulty and number of cars down, the game is better, but still quite difficult.   

There are no tutorials, which means there's no explanation of the boost system (it seem it awards boost for style points when near other cars, maybe?) and the AI is INCREDIBLY difficult.  If you don't race near perfect on Easy, you'll lose.  Even when racing perfect, you better be boosting.  At medium, you don't have a shot, you probably need perfect boosts, and even then there's no rubber banding if someone gets ahead so expect to lose often. 

The game has the following modes. 
Race, (standard difficult race) 
Challenge mode (Seems like race, couldn't beat the first challenge) 
Splatout! (Kill zombies, race around the track for points) 
Offroad
NightShift (night driving?)

If anyone's planning on going on sick leave, this game is definitely a recommendation; a two-minute dose of this piece of garbage will give you third-degree diarrhea.

No, let's be honest, presenting such a load of crap as the successor to a great game is just amazing. The fact that the developers even allowed other developers to ruin the game like that—seriously, money was once again more important than customers.

Many people only bought the game because Flatout 2 was so awesome, and they hoped this silly thing would blow the fat out of it too. The only thing it's blowing out is my graphics card.

But I feel the most sorry for my graphics card; it barely survived; it almost died while running the game.

""Ура эта игра установилась(учитывая слабый ПК,загрузки я ждал 2 часа)...О!!!!!Запустилась...хм,классный дизайн меню,прикольно!!!!новые режимчики...тааааак...гоночка...

Ну вот и наступила сама гонка
""1,2..и...3...Чё...ВАТ,ЧЁ БЛЯДЬ??????????????????????????????????????ЧЁ ЭТО ЗА ХУЙНЯ??????""
Короче я сидел минуту с открытым ртом,а потом вышел и хотел сделать харакири,ну а если точно,что мне не понравилось и почему я купил этот ""шедевр.""
Были скидки на флотауты,и я решел взять ултимейт карнаж(или как там) и 3 часть,я знал на что иду,поку пая 3 часть,но думал что...а хер знает о чём я думал,короче когда я запустил гонку я испытал не самые лучшие ощущения физики,то есть машина была...слишком лёгкая...когда я ей управлял,я не чувствовал той тяжести входа в поворот как во 2 части,я вообще не понимал,почему эта машина так управляется,также хочу обратить внимание на соперников...ИХ НЕТУ!!!!!То есть есть машины,а водителей нету...то есть есть машины и водители,но нет имён водителей,во 2 части это было в каком то смысле неотъемлимой частью(лично для меня) я знал кого как зовут и знал на кого орать когда меня обгоняют тут же ни  у кого нет имени,так ещё и машины все на одно лицо,и это следующий недостаток.Когда начинаешь играть во 2 часть,то тебе уже предлагают 3 сильно отличающийща машины,когда тут и класс любой можно выбрать,так ещё и машины одинаковые.Ну и последнее,а именно дизайн трасс,опять же хочу упомянуть,что во 2 части выезд за трассу очень жестоко корался,в лесу было кучу кочек,деревьев и камней,а на треке тебя замедляло,так тут это забудте,лично мне так повезло,что мне выдало подсказку,что нужно срезать,ну а когда я начал играть,то увидел,что все боты срезают,и ещё хочу отметить убогий дизайе карт,лично я за то время,что проехал,увидел только домики,да повороты направо и налево...
Вот такие ощущения я испытал за 3 минуты и игра получает...

Personally, I spent 3 minutes in the game, I repeat, 3 minutes, and how those 3 minutes went...
""Hooray, this game installed (considering my weak PC, I waited 2 hours for it to load)... Oh!!!!! It launched... hmm, cool menu design, cool!!!! New modes... sooooo... racing...
WHAT???? Where's the very first class, what kind of cars are these... ok, I'll choose this one, WAA ... Well, here comes the race itself.
""1, 2... and... 3... WHA... WHAT THE FUCK??????????????????????????????????????? WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS??????""
Anyway, I sat there for a minute with my mouth open, and then I went out and wanted to commit hara-kiri. Well, to be precise, what didn't I like and why did I buy this ""masterpiece?""
There were discounts on fleetouts, and I decided to take the ultimate carnage (or whatever it is) and part 3, I knew what I was getting into when I bought part 3, but I thought that... and who the hell knows what I was thinking, in short, when I started the race, I didn’t experience the best sensations of physics, that is, the car was... too light... when I drove it, I didn’t feel the same heaviness of entering a turn as in part 2, I didn’t understand at all why this car handled like that, I also want to draw attention to the opponents... THEY ARE NOT THERE!!!!! That is, there are cars, but no drivers... that is, there are cars and drivers, but there are no names of the drivers, in part 2 this was in some sense an integral part (for me personally) I knew everyone’s name and I knew who to yell at when they overtake me, but here no one has a name, and the cars all look the same, and this is the next drawback. When you start playing part 2, you are already offered 3 strong The cars are different, when you can choose any class, and the cars are also the same. And finally, namely the track design. I want to mention again that in the 2nd game, driving off-track was really tough. There were tons of bumps, trees, and rocks in the forest, and on-track it slowed you down. Forget about that here. I was lucky enough to get a hint that I needed to take a shortcut, but when I started playing, I saw that all the bots were taking shortcuts. I also want to point out the poor map design. Personally, in the time I drove, I only saw houses and right and left turns...
That's how I felt in 3 minutes, and the game gets...

Ok, I'm just going to tell you my experience with this game. My entire 8 minutes, That's all I played of this, and that's all I will EVER play of this. So, I've heard past reviews, I've seen videos of it, And I was convinced that this was a disgrace. So how did I end up with it? Because I bought the pack that came with it. I legit only wanted Flatout 1 & 2, and this thing tagged along with Ultimate Carnage (can't get that to work, but that's probably still way better than this). Because of that, I decided to try it. ""Maybe it isn't so bad,"" I thought to myself. ""Maybe it's just a letdown and that's why it's lower rated than Ride to Hell: Retribution.""

Oh, I was wrong. So, SO wrong.

So, after this thing eats 11GB of my hard drive (yes, 11 Gigabytes of valuable space), I hit play and brace myself. The loading screen pops up, the game loads, and I configure my controller. I choose a race, select my car and character, there's another loading screen, and the race starts.

Now, here's my first of many problems with this game. The visuals.
Why do all the cars look like the toy cars from that Burnout Paradise DLC? Excuse me, even worse than those?
Not to mention the stage I was racing in was completely bland and uninteresting, with only right corners. Yes, only 90 degree turns in this stage. Even Flatout 1 had curved corners in it's first track. And yes, I know this was done by a different studio then Bugbear, the original creators, but still, have some variety in your stages to get the player interested (not like I was to begin with).
 
Second of all, and by far the biggest complaint from everyone who's played this, the controls and physics. DEAR GOD.
The car turned so stiff around the corners. It was literally the most unresponsive control in a racing game I've ever experienced. And the physics? Do you know how crazy and wacky the physics were in previous Flatout games? Well, there's little to no physics here. When the car hit the one ramp in the stage, it was like it was on a preset jump path. It only went up and down, it didn't even turn to the side. It was kinda like that jump in the original Ridge Racer. Except this isn't 1994 or on a Playstation 1, this game was released in 2011. Also, do you know what was one of Flatout's main selling points or what made it fun? The crashes and ragdoll physics. Here, you tap one wall going 30 miles per hour and explode. And there's no ragdoll cam. And it doesn't even look cool. Have any of the developers who made this even play or SEE a Flatout game before? Because it doesn't feel like it.

And now for my last point which kinda ties into the physics point, the stunts. That's right, I actually played a different mode after the race. I tried something that I don't think anyone did before. I went one step further and tried a stunt event.

So, after the stunt stage loads, I hit the accelerate button, press eject at the ramp and.... OH MY GOD WHAT?
If you don't know (which you probably don't), you can pick different characters/ragdolls at the menu. I picked the first guy, who has a trenchcoat on. When I launched him during the stunt, it cut to a ragdoll camera for once. And, well....
You know how sometimes games have that bug where a hair piece or piece of clothing stretch out in an odd way? Like into a wall or something? Well, my ragdoll's trenchcoat did that the first time. Then I retried the stunt, and it did it again. I actually think the developers gave up after the first stage of this game and never bug tested it. You hear that a lot with shitty, undeveloped games, but I truly thought that when I saw it. 

So.... in conclusion, don't buy this. Please don't buy this abysmal mess. Even if you got it with the pack, don't download it. Shitty graphics, controls, physics, this game has it all. Did I mention that this takes up 11GB of space? I did, but did I also mention this game costs $30 normally? THIRTY DOLLARS? You can actually get Flatout 1 and 2 on sale, which are way WAY better than this for less. Even when this thing is on sale right now (at the time of posting this), you can still get the original 2 for less.

I now know why everyone despises this game. Why it's the lowest rated game on Steam. And it's still up.

23954771,hungarian,2016.05.30 17:26,✅,✅,0.4761904776,0,"This is the first (and sadly the only) Flat Out game developer by Team6.

There are some game modes like demo derby, racing, stunts and doing tricks with specific car.

The first impression was very good for the game. Anyway I like Team6 Game Studio's racing games from early years. So it's the easiest Flat out in the series. Controls are easy, not like in Flat Out or Flat Out 2. You will easy pick the pace up. Also a good thing: whe you complete a game mode, it's cars available in other gamemodes (e.g.: you can use demolition cars in Speed mode, which is a fun, even with 16 car!).

The only negative thing is the stunts are really hard, sometimes I don't know what I have to do!

While the previous titles sported a delicate balance of racing, wrecking, and arcade-like elements... this game throws it out the window and shares little in common with previous games aside from the genre of being a demolition-style racing game and it's title.

Visually the game looks worse than it's predecessor. The two are not even comparable; It looks more like a game I would have expected to play on the originally PlayStation or maybe an arcade.

Game-play-wise the cars have no real ""life"" to them, and again feel like something I would expect from an arcade game I pop $1 into. In previous iterations, cars felt like they had weight; you could slide beautifully around dirt corners, drift through tight turns, and could manipulate AI cars by using your force/speed/inertia. All that is gone in this game; even the most difficult looking turns are easily mastered by simply momentarily letting off the gas and simply hitting your left or right key; gone are the days of worrying about oversteer, understeer, or compensating for loss of traction. Even the ways cars bounce off each other seems more like you are in a pinball machine getting popped around by the bumpers --- you don't really have much control or force over other AI vehicles so you are at their mercy if their ""line"" gets in your way.

Also gone are the days of customizing your car tuning. Probably one of my favorite parts of any racing sim or, for lack of a better term, any ""car game"" in general is the ability to swap X for Y and make your car, YOUR car. All the white knuckle driving done to take 1st pays off for that next much wanted upgrade. Not here ---- you pick from the standard layout of cars, and then you can pick from 2 or 3 different pre-defined ""tuning"" settings which invariably just give you more speed for less durability or vice versa. But in reality, it doesn't matter because EVERY CAR FEELS EXACTLY THE SAME.

I'm not usually too harsh but I cannot recommend this game to anyone. If you are looking for an arcade-style racing game I am sure there are many alternatives that would be better. If you are looking at this game because you've player previous FlatOut games, then skip it entirely as it is not the same development team and therefore not the same game at all.

Flatout 3 montre à la perfection le travail indispensable d'une équipe de game-designers en vous proposant une expérience où le seul game-designer était Dédé, tuner du dimanche, ayant envie de voir des voitures et des flammes.

Qu'es-ce que n'a pas ? Il n'a pas de physique cohérente à elle-même, il n'a pas de moteur graphique performant (même pour son époque), il n'a pas d'IA, il n'a pas de carte intéressante, il n'a pas de véhicule fun, il n'a pas d'impression de conduite, il n'a pas d'équipe de développement (en fait si et c'est pire), il n'a pas de logique, il n'a pas d'optimisation, il n'a pas de raison à être acheté à moins que ce soit le cadeau empoisonné d'un bundle permettant d'aider des enfants en train de mourrir auquel vous tenez absolument à participer.

Si vous voulez jouer à Flatout, jouez au premier, jouez à Flatout 2, jouez à Ultimate Carnage, jouez à la série Burnout mais surtout, ne perdez pas du temps avec ce jeu.

A noter que si vous souhaitez vous lancer dans le monde du jeu vidéo de manière professionnelle, quel que soit ce domaine, je vous recommande de jouer à ce jeu. Il permet en effet de mettre en avant de manière très clair que certains fondamentaux du jeu vidéos ne sont pas à oublier dans leurs conceptions et vous donnera un bon aperçu de se qu'est un véritable mauvais jeu.","How to describe this thing?

Flatout 3 perfectly demonstrates the indispensable work of a team of game designers by offering you an experience where the only game designer was Dédé, a weekend tuner, who wanted to see cars and flames.

What doesn't it have? It doesn't have consistent physics, it doesn't have a powerful graphics engine (even for its time), it doesn't have AI, it doesn't have an interesting map, it doesn't have a fun vehicle, it doesn't have a driving experience, it doesn't have a development team (actually, it does, and it's worse), it doesn't have logic, it doesn't have optimization, it has no reason to buy it unless it's the poisoned chalice of a bundle helping dying children that you absolutely want to participate in.

If you want to play Flatout, play the first one, play Flatout 2, play Ultimate Carnage, play the Burnout series, but most importantly, don't waste your time with this game.

Note that if you want to get into the world of video games professionally, in any field, I recommend playing this game. It clearly highlights the fundamentals of video games that shouldn't be overlooked in their design and will give you a good idea of ​​what a truly bad game is."

Uristen ez micsoda? Ez valami viccc? Srácok, én tényleg azt hittem, hogy a Flatout sorozat fojtatása lesz ez a valami, de ennek az izének semmi köze nincs a szériához!! Ez a játék szerintem a Flatout sorozat legalja, konkrétan játszhatatlan fostalicska az egész!! De most komolyan, ezt senki nem tesztelte le, hogy lehet így kiadni egy játékot 2012 -ben?? 

Az igazság az hogy én a Flatout előző részeit imádtam, végig is vittem mindegyik részt, rengeteget játszottam velük, sőt a legendás zenei válogatást a mai napig hallgatom, de most ettől a vacaktól, egyszerűen sokkot kaptam..., nem értem hogy mi történt!!???

Természetesen megint a jármű fizikán bukik el minden. Az autóknak nincs súlya, tapadása, egyszerűen kezelhetetlen és irányíthatatlan az egész, egy kanyart nem tudsz bevenni normálisan. A járművek viselkedésében semmi különbséget nem fedeztem fel, az autók pingpong labdaként csapódnak ide-oda, állandóan pattog, csúszkál, felborul, megpördül, beakad, felmegy a falra!! [Nem hiszem el, olyan az egész mintha megszűnt volna a gravitáció a Föld nevű bolygón!] 
A nitro effect ocsmány, a sebesség érzet nulla, törésmodell helyett meg robbanás effect -t van amit úgy oldották meg fejlesztő barátaink, hogy ha bárminek picit nagyobb sebességgel nekikoccansz már azonnal fel is robbansz!! 
Természetesen a rengeteg BUG és az állandó beakadások sem hiányozhatnak, sőt komplett játék kifagyáshoz is volt már szerencsém! Néha meg olyan mintha a jármű nem is reagálna az iránygombokra, hiába nyomom a féket plusz a kéziféket csak megy egyenesen, nem fordul, teljesen mást csinál! F#CK!

Borzalmas, érthetetlen és katasztrófa az egész!!

A játék mechanikája baromi egyszerű; ütközöl-robbansz-újraéledsz > ütközöl-robbansz-újraéledsz... ennyi!!
Például a kedvencem amikor mész az első helyen ''nyugodtan'' senki nem zavar, egyszer csak hátulról neked jönnek, persze te azonnal felrobbansz majd respawn-olsz és naná hogy az utolsó helyen találod magad és már a büdös életben nem éred utol a többieket! Na ez van könnyű nehézségi fokozaton... F#CK!

Grafika & Audio
Ugye fiúk azt ti sem gondoltátok komolyan, hogy 2012 -ben ilyen grafikával el tudtok majd adni egy autósjátékot, srácok ez ide nagyon kevés! Bevallom a képernyőmentés gombot nem volt kedvem megnyomni egyszer sem a játék alatt! Esküszöm a két első résznek is már szebb grafikája és robbanás effectei voltak mint ennek a hulladéknak! Röviden ocsmány és undorító az egész!! Story nincs, Intro nincs, csak egy ócska csapnivaló menüt és töltőképernyőt kapunk!
Úgy néz ki a játékmotor is instabil, egyszer 200fps -em van, majd egyszer csak hirtelen leesik 30 alá pedig semmi robbanás vagy grafikai csoda nem történik!? Érthetetlen és idegesítő!!

A zenék, effektek és a kocsik hangja elviselhetetlen, csapni való, szemét! A motor hangokat is inkább egy beteg fűnyírómotorhoz tudnám hasonlítani! F#CK!

Komolyan mondom a világ legszarabb autós játéka ez, hatalmas csalódás és döbbenet számomra, ha fizetnének érte, hogy minden nap játsszak vele még akkor sem vállalnám el semmi pénzért!!
Sajnos ez kőkemény Bul!sh@it Category -a! Messziről kerüljétek el, ezért cast ne adjatok egy fillért nem ér az egész!! Ha minden áron Flatout -tal akarsz játszani, akkor csak az első két részt tudom ajánlani! Ezt a részt felejtsétek el örökre!!!


[i] Srácok akinek köze volt ehhez a projekthez komolyan mondom szégyellje magát, hagyja abba a szakmát és menjen el a tesco -ba árufelöltőnek!!!     [De ne a játék osztályra könyörgöm!] [/i]

U.I.: Kedves fejlesztő csapat, Hölgyek és Urak egy kis fizika óra következik...

[i] A gravitáció, más néven tömegvonzás egy kölcsönhatás, amely bármilyen két, tömeggel bíró test között fennáll, és a testek tömegközéppontjainak egymás felé gyorsulását okozza. A gravitációs erő a klasszikus fizikában az az erő, amelyet az egyik test a másikra a gravitáció jelenségének megfelelően kifejt.
Egy testre ható gravitációs erő az egyik a Föld felszínén álló megfigyelő számára a legnagyobb összetevője a test súlyának, a testre ható nehézségi erőnek. A Földhöz rögzített koordináta-rendszerben amely nem inerciarendszer, hanem gyorsuló koordináta-rendszer, szemlélve a gravitációs erő mellett kisebb mértékben tehetetlenségi erők, a centrifugális erő, a Coriolis-erő és Föld nagyon kis mértékben változó szögsebességű forgása szöggyorsulása miatti Euler-erő is hozzájárul a nehézségi erőhöz.
Az általános relativitáselmélet ekvivalenciaelve szerint lokálisan megkülönböztethetetlen egymástól, hogy egy testre ható erő gravitáció vagy a koordináta-rendszer gyorsulása miatt lép-e fel.

A gravitációs vonzerő nagysága a következő összefüggés szerint számítható ki:
F_{grav} = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{d^2} 
ahol m1 és m2 a két test tömege, d a két test tömegközéppontja közti távolság, továbbá G a gravitációs állandó, amelynek ma elfogadott értéke: [/i]

Во-первых:отвратительная графика.
Во-вторых:ужасное управление.
В-третьих:нету карьеры, ну может она там и есть, ну я по крайней мере её не нашёл, а это большой минус, прятать от игрока карьеру!
Ну и остальные минуса:
Нет саундтреков, под которые обычно играют в игру с жанром ""ГОНКИ"", нет режима ""ДЕРБИ"", хотя режимов там достаточно.
Плюсы игры:
Конечно же это машины, да тачки там не плохие с этим я соглашусь, но и в предыдущей части FlatOut 2 тоже  были крутые тачки.
В общем друзья мои я решил - Не покупайте эту игру, зря отдадите деньги, купите вторую часть игры, она на много лучше и дешевле этого дерьма!
В общем НЕ РЕКОМЕНДУЮ.
","Let's start by saying this is a terrible game, and I don't recommend buying it!

First: the graphics are terrible.
Second: the controls are terrible.
Third: there's no career, well, maybe there is, but at least I didn't find one, and that's a big minus, hiding a career from the player!
And the other minuses:
There are no soundtracks, which are typical for racing games, and there's no DERBY mode, although there are plenty of modes.
The game's pros:
Of course, it's the cars, and the cars in it aren't bad, I agree, but the previous game, FlatOut 2, also had cool cars.
So, my friends, I've decided: Don't buy this game, you'll be wasting your money. Buy the second game, it's much better and cheaper than this piece of crap!

Эта серия стала одной из моих любимых еще в детстве, ведь в этих играх мы с друзьями каждый день могли терять по много часов, разбивая машины в хлам, и это никогда не надоедало.

Итак, на дворе у нас 2016-ый год,  распродажа в стиме. Я вижу бандл - четыре игры флетаут за смешную цену - 89 рублей. Ставлю сразу все четыре. И единственной незнакомой для меня игрой являетя флетаут 3, т.к. с предыдущими мне довелось познакомиться, пускай и на пиратских версиях игр. 

В этой игре я не смог провести больше пяти минут. Она ужасна, начиная с меню и заканчивая геймплеем. Плюс для настройки графики эта игра требует с вас индекс производительности виндоус (это вообще каким образом???), который, кстати говоря, у меня есть, но игра отказывается его видеть. 

Я все выставил на максимум, на мгновение решил дать игре шанс, забыл обо всех рецензиях с ужасно низкими рейтингами и фразами вроде ""это вообще не флетаут"", закрыл глаза на очень криво сделанное меню и далеко не самую лучшую графику, и попробовал сыграть первую гонку.

Я не смогу описать того рвотного чувства, которое у меня возникло после всего одного круга (а их три) в первой же гонке флетаута 3. Я тут же закрыл игру, и вот, как я сам замечаю, отзыв я к этой игре пишу уже дольше, чем смог выдержать времени в этой игре.

Мой вердикт: тотальное разочарование. Это не флетаут. Это больше похоже на какую-то инди-разработку. При чем, как мне кажется, дай вы разработку этой игры пусть и всего одному, но рукастому гейм-мейкеру, который любит серию флетаут - он бы сделал игру лучше, чем этот, откровенно говоря, тройной плевок в душу всем фанатам серии.
Я играл в неё только ради ачивок... Но после трёх минут игры я выключил этот по*ос... Потом начал писать обзор ,но стим сказал: Неет! Иди блюй дальше или наиграй 5 минут что-бы написать обзор! Ну я включил этот понос...
Нет ни музыки, звуков разрушения и т.д и т.п!

Покупать если и стоит, то только в паке с тремя настоящими флетаутами - первым, вторым и ультимейт кэрнейджем.

Спасибо за внимание.","Well... I should probably start by saying that I really love the FlatOut series. It's been one of my favorites since childhood, because my friends and I could spend hours every day smashing cars to pieces, and it never got boring.

So, it's 2016, and there's a Steam sale. I see a bundle – four FlatOut games for the ridiculous price of 89 rubles. I buy all four. The only game I'm unfamiliar with is FlatOut 3, as I've played the previous ones, albeit on pirated versions.

I couldn't spend more than five minutes playing this game. It's terrible, from the menus to the gameplay. Plus, to configure the graphics, this game requires a Windows Performance Index (how on earth is that possible???), which, by the way, I have, but the game refuses to recognize it.

I maxed everything out, briefly decided to give the game a chance, forgot about all the reviews with their horribly low ratings and phrases like ""this isn't Flatout at all,"" ignored the very poorly designed menu and far from the best graphics, and tried the first race.

I can't describe the nausea I felt after just one lap (of which there are three) in the very first race of Flatout 3. I immediately closed the game, and now, as I notice, I've been writing a review for this game longer than I could stand playing it.

My verdict: total disappointment. This isn't Flatout. It feels more like some kind of indie development. Moreover, I think if you gave this game development to even one skilled game maker who loves the Flatout series, they would have made a better game than this, frankly, triple-whammy of a game to all fans of the series. I only played it for the achievements... But after three minutes of playing, I turned off the crap... Then I started writing a review, but Steam said, ""No! Go puke or play for 5 minutes to write a review!"" So, I turned on this crap...
There's no music, no destruction sounds, etc., etc.!

If it's worth buying, it's only in the pack with three real flatouts—the first, second, and the ultimate carrier.

Thank you for your attention."

This is one of the games on steam where a [i]neutral[/i] option would prove useful.
In its current state, I simply can't recommend this game, certainly not at $30. Maybe if you pick it up in a bundle for $3 or less, or a price tag of $5~10, but no more than this.

I actually enjoyed the game, having played to completion the two Battle Arenas, but it fell short on Racing and Monster Trucks due to one fundamental problem - the [i]handling[/i] of the various vehicles was just horrible at speed. It's recommended in the first race tips to master the handbreak, though this seemingly does very little on its own. Used in conjuction with the boost (or being slammed from behind), I was able to take corners, and finished the first race on fifth or sixth position, but the problem with that was the even further loss of control, often resulting in slamming into someones living room, least for the first race.

Then there's the damage control system to contend with. I completely fail to understand how slamming into another vehicle at 160 kph head-on can deal only 1~3% of damage, while a slight ""scratch"" at half that speed can deal 5~15%+. I won, and lost, many a times for this during the Battle Arenas, even if did still technically win on points alone; which ""feel"" like for NPC's points are stopped been counted as soon as the player loses, instead of artifically continuing until the last one standing was revealed. 

Graphics wise, can't complain too much. There's a wide selection of vehicles, colours, and even characters behind the wheels, seldom ""repeated"" by the NPCs, if at all. So there's plenty of variance on the track. Though at no point did I actually see for example a wheel flying off, or a character being thrown out of the car when the car itself dies off, which can apparently be done in one of the other game modes where you land them in a target following a crash. A game from 1995, Destruction Derby 2, was based much the same as Flatout 3, and even for its time, if you took too much damage various parts of the vehicle would go flying; the wheels included, which then (was supposed too, but aided sometimes.) negatively affected your vehicle control, or you had the hood bouncing around obstructing your view until more damage knocked it flying off. These are relatively small things, but they matter to the overall experience.

[h1]Long Story Short[/h1]

[*] Damage control system based as a whole, rather than individual parts of the vehicle.
[*] Vehicle clipping. Occasionally at speed you'd drive straight through another vehicle, rather than hitting them
[*] (Maybe just me?) No, or little, ability to recharge your boost gauge. Tips say it recharges during jumps or causing damage, but it seems much more random than this.
[*] Damage having little to no affect on vehicle control. No losing of wheels until completely destroyed.
[*] Lack of varied sound effects; e.g horns, announcer discussions, crash sounds.
[*] Random unexplained ""flatout3.exe has stopped working..."" errors, or in some cases, inability to load the game at all according to some users.
[*] No Trading Cards ;)

So once again, I cannot recommend this game in its current state, at the current price. 
If you can buy it in a bundle, then by all means. Otherwise, wait for a 80~95% sale, by which point it may be worth a couple of hours of entertainment, but overall, if the developers ever come back to this game, it does have its potential if cared for properly.","[h1]Racing with a Broken Axle[/h1]

I v běžném závodu, kde záleží na pořadí, si ale destrukce mohu užít daleko víc – stačí nastavit jednoduššší protivníky, vyblbnout se a na umístění zaútočit na konec. Pokud ale někdo touží po výzvě, může vyzkoušet mód kariéry, kde je obtížnost posazena vysoko. Ostatní můžou kampaň ignorovat, všechny tratě se dají odemykat i mimo ni.
Nevýhodou je grafika, která je na nastavení pod úrovní ""Vysoká"" poněkud rozmazaná. Nároky jí příliš neodpovídají. Hudební doprovod je také poněkud slabší stránkou hry, není moc energický. No a ve Stuntmanovi jde někdy hůře pochopit, co se vlastně žádá a jak bych to měl provést.
Celkově však hra postačí na to, abych si mohl užít pohledy na srážky a výbuchy, i díky destrukčnímu modelu, se kterým je jednodušší škody způsobovat. Jako milý bonus je ve hře umístěno pár artworků.","Unlike the previous parts, where despite all the possible destruction the position was the most important in the races, this part brings game modes where you can enjoy the destruction even during the race and finally thanks to it you can finish on the front lines. Even in a normal race, where order matters, I can enjoy the destruction much more - just set up simpler opponents, go crazy and attack the position at the end. But if someone wants a challenge, they can try the career mode, where the difficulty is set high. Others can ignore the campaign, all tracks can be unlocked outside of it.
The downside is the graphics, which are somewhat blurry at settings below ""High"". The claims don't quite match her. The musical accompaniment is also a rather weak side of the game, it is not very energetic. Well, in Stuntman it is sometimes harder to understand what is actually being asked and how I should do it.
Overall, though, the game is enough for me to enjoy the sight of crashes and explosions, even thanks to the destruction model, which is easier to deal damage with. As a nice bonus, some artwork is placed in the game."

Дело в том, что, в основном, их писали люди, игравшие (и безумно любившие) в первые две части. Они купили третью, ожидая, что она будет в их духе - но... Оказалось, что все совсем не то.  Я тоже прошел полностью обе предшественницы этой и что могу сказать - эта игра не хуже и не лучше. Она просто другая. Да, управление стало неприлично аркадным, при использовании нитро тачки ремонтируются (так что разбиться в гонке или разбить кого-то теперь крайне трудно), автомобили отвратительно недетализированы, однотипны, музыка слабовата, да и звуки моторов тоже (ситуацию частично вытаскивает потрясающий объемный общий звук), трассы тоже заметно отупели и стали более примитивными (что также частично компенсируется уймой режимов игры), у предметов начисто пропал вес, да и у машин он не особо чувствуется, и так далее, далее, далее... Зато у меня, как у человека с бензином в крови, вид мчащихся, болтающихся из стороны в сторону и разбивающихся соперников вызывает непреодолимое желание догнать, перегнать, а еще лучше, еще и разбить врага. То, что происходит во время гонки трудно передать словами. Все горит, взрывается, в глазах все перемешивается и иногда не понять, где трасса, кругом разлетаются какие-то детали (со спецэффектами явно переборщили, их настолько много, что трудно понять, что происхоит), трасса быстро покрывается всяким мусором. Автомобиль летает по трассе, переворачивается, врезается во все, что только можно, аварии следуют бесконечной чередой... Иногда при очередной уже непонятно, куда ехать и что происходит, но вот после череды переворотов выкидывает прямо носом к тоннелю и снова тапку в пол. Если в первых двух частях гонка хотя и держала в напряжении, но было время подумать на прохождением очередного поворота, или даже немного расслабиться в какой-то момент, то тут так не получится. Игра держит в колоссальном напряжении каждую миллисекунду, реакция и рефлексы работают на полную. Даже просто ехать по длинной прямой нелегко, или самого мотнет и начинается череда жутких аварий, то в тебя кто-то врезается и вместе с ним летим сначала в дерево, потом в другое, потом в стену, попутно разнося заборы и прочий хлам. В общем, то, что надо, чтобы отвлечься после тяжелейшего рабочего дня и забыться от мрачной реальности. Вот за этот бешеный драйв и хаос, сумасшедшие и красочнейшие аварии я положительно оцениваю эту игру. Хотя и с примесью грусти - флэтаут уже не тот...","There are a lot of negative reviews about this game, although I personally disagree. The thing is, they were mostly written by people who played (and absolutely loved) the first two games. They bought the third one, expecting it to be in their spirit, but... It turned out to be completely different. I also played through both of this one's predecessors, and what can I say? This game is no worse or better. It's just different. Yes, the controls have become indecently arcade-like, cars are repaired when using nitro (making it extremely difficult to crash or wreck someone in a race), the cars are disgustingly lacking in detail and uniform, the music is weak, as are the engine sounds (something partially redeemed by the stunning surround sound), the tracks have also noticeably become duller and more primitive (which is also partially compensated for by the myriad of game modes), objects have completely lost weight, and cars don't really feel it either, and so on, and so on... But for me, as a person with gasoline in my blood, the sight of rivals racing, swinging from side to side, and crashing inspires an irresistible desire to catch, overtake, and even better, wreck them. It's hard to put into words what happens during a race. Everything burns, explodes, everything blurs before your eyes, and sometimes it's hard to tell where the track is, with parts flying everywhere (the special effects are clearly overdone; there are so many of them that it's hard to tell what's happening), and the track quickly becomes covered in all sorts of debris. The car flies around the track, flips, crashes into everything it can, and the crashes are endless... Sometimes, with the next one, it's hard to tell where to go or what's going on, but after a series of flips, you're thrown straight into a tunnel and the pedal is to the metal again. While the racing in the first two games was tense, there was time to think about the next turn, or even relax a little at some point, that's not the case here. The game keeps you on edge every millisecond, with reactions and reflexes working at full speed. Even just driving along a long straight is difficult, or you'll get knocked around and a series of horrific accidents begin. Someone crashes into you, and together we fly first into a tree, then another, then a wall, smashing fences and other junk along the way. Basically, it's just what you need to unwind after a hard day at work and forget the grim reality. It's for this frantic drive and chaos, the crazy and colorful crashes, that I give this game a thumbs up. Although there's a hint of sadness—flatout isn't what it used to be..."

Поиграв 10 мин, я понял, что игра такое гавно за которую даже одного рубля жалко отдать будет.
Начнем с физики и повреждений.
Физики... НЕТ! Какая физика? Вы о чем? Разработчики незнают вообще что такое физика ( руки бы программистам оторвать)
Повреждения ну просто полный P I Z D E C. Врежешься в какого нибудь бота с большой скоростью и что... немножк помнеться и все. В предыдущих частях повреждения были эпичные, а здесь просто нет слов.
Переходим к машинам. Тут некоторые машины слизаны с предыдущих частей, некоторые тупо переделанные иномарки.
Карты это вообще другая песня. Хер пойми куда едешь. Тебя несет просто и все. Ты пытаешься что-то разобрать через пыль или воду (да еще и мыльная графика, удваивает проблему), но в итоге улетаешь куда-то, либо просто врезаешься в тупик. 
Музыка... Музыка... Музыка... НЕТ КОММЕНТАРИЕВ! Даже описывать не хочу, но скажу сразу: после этой музыки уши болеть начнут.

Все описывать не буду, просто рассказал вкратце что из себя представляет эта игра... ой извините, это гавно
И странно, почему-то именно третие-части знаменитых серий игр получаются говняными (за исключением far cry)
Взять Carmageddon. Первые две части ну просто охеренны а третья: Carmageddon TDR2000, обосрала всю серию. Не ну третья карма хоть как-то играбельна. А Flatout 3, кабздец. Вот что будет если за сиквел игры береться какая-нибудь левая кампания.
Вообщем не покупайте это гавно, ну если только по скидочке, да и то, лучше все части купить.","How can you trash the Flatout series like that?

After playing for 10 minutes, I realized the game is such crap it's a shame to spend even a single ruble on it.
Let's start with physics and damage.
Physics... NO! What physics? What are you talking about? The developers don't even know what physics is (I'd like to rip the programmers' hands off).
The damage is just complete nonsense. You crash into some bot at high speed and... well, you'll get a little dented and that's it. The damage in the previous games was epic, but here it's just beyond words.
Moving on to the cars. Some of the cars here are ripped off from previous games, some are simply redesigned foreign cars.
The maps are a whole different story. You have no idea where you're going. You just drift, that's all. You try to make something out through dust or water (and the blurry graphics double the problem), but you end up flying off somewhere or just crashing into a dead end.
Music... Music... Music... NO COMMENTS! I don't even want to describe it, but I'll say it right away: after this music, your ears will hurt.

I won't describe everything, I'll just briefly describe what this game is... oh, sorry, it's crap.
And it's strange, for some reason, it's the third installments of famous game series that turn out to be crap (with the exception of Far Cry).
Take Carmageddon. The first two installments are simply amazing, but the third: Carmageddon TDR2000, trashed the entire series. Well, at least the third Karma is somewhat playable. And Flatout 3, damn. That's what happens if some mediocre campaign takes on a sequel. In general, don't buy this crap, unless you get a discount, and even then, it's better to buy all the parts."

Эта серия стала одной из моих любимых еще в детстве, ведь в этих играх мы с друзьями каждый день могли терять по много часов, разбивая машины в хлам, и это никогда не надоедало.

Итак, на дворе у нас 2015-ый год, новогодняя распродажа в стиме. Я вижу бандл - четыре игры флетаут за смешную цену - 89 рублей. Ставлю сразу все четыре. И единственной незнакомой для меня игрой являетя флетаут 3, т.к. с предыдущими мне довелось познакомиться, пускай и на пиратских версиях игр. 

В этой игре я не смог провести больше пяти минут. Она ужасна, начиная с меню и заканчивая геймплеем. Плюс для настройки графики эта игра требует с вас индекс производительности виндоус (это вообще каким образом???), который, кстати говоря, у меня есть, но игра отказывается его видеть. 

Я все выставил на максимум, на мгновение решил дать игре шанс, забыл обо всех рецензиях с ужасно низкими рейтингами и фразами вроде ""это вообще не флетаут"", закрыл глаза на очень криво сделанное меню и далеко не самую лучшую графику, и попробовал сыграть первую гонку.

Я не смогу описать того рвотного чувства, которое у меня возникло после всего одного круга (а их три) в первой же гонке флетаута 3. Я тут же закрыл игру, и вот, как я сам замечаю, отзыв я к этой игре пишу уже дольше, чем  смог выдержать времени в этой игре.

Мой вердикт: тотальное разочарование. Это не флетаут. Это больше похоже на какую-то инди-разработку. При чем, как мне кажется, дай вы разработку этой игры пусть и всего одному, но рукастому гейм-мейкеру, который любит серию флетаут - он бы сделал игру лучше, чем этот, откровенно говоря, тройной плевок в душу всем фанатам серии.

Покупать если и стоит, то только в паке с тремя настоящими флетаутами - первым, вторым и ультимейт кэрнейджем.

Спасибо за внимание.","Well... I should probably start by saying that I really love the FlatOut series. It's been one of my favorites since childhood, because my friends and I could spend hours every day smashing cars to pieces, and it never got boring.

So, it's 2015, and there's a New Year's sale on Steam. I see a bundle – four FlatOut games for the ridiculous price of 89 rubles. I buy all four. And the only game I'm unfamiliar with is FlatOut 3, since I've played the previous ones, albeit on pirated versions.

I couldn't spend more than five minutes playing this game. It's terrible, from the menus to the gameplay. Plus, to configure the graphics, this game requires a Windows Performance Index (how on earth is that possible???), which, by the way, I have, but the game refuses to recognize it.

I maxed everything out, briefly decided to give the game a chance, forgot about all the reviews with their horribly low ratings and phrases like ""this isn't Flatout at all,"" ignored the very poorly designed menu and far from the best graphics, and tried the first race.

I can't describe the nausea I felt after just one lap (of which there are three) in the very first race of Flatout 3. I immediately closed the game, and now, as I notice, I've been writing a review for this game longer than I could stand playing it.

My verdict: total disappointment. This isn't Flatout. It feels more like some kind of indie development. Moreover, I think if you gave this game development to even one skilled game maker who loves the Flatout series, they would have made a better game than this, frankly, triple-whammy of a game to all fans of the series.

If it's worth buying, it should only be in a pack with three true flatouts—the first, second, and ultimate.

Thank you for your attention."

   Вторая часть была просто лучшей гонкой из всех, что я когда-либо играл. Но, к глубочайшему сожалению, за третью часть решили взяться Team 6 Studios. И что из этого вышло? Графика и саундтреки хуже, чем были в FlatOut 2 и FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage; интерфейс действительно убог. Начало заезда начинается с нитро, которое восполняется само, что полночтью убивает краш-потенциал игры - то самой фишки, за которую и полюбили серию FlatOut.
   А вот о физике в игре можно говорить вечность, но всё, что я бы сказал, склоняется к тому, что её просто НЕТ. Малейший удар о стенку может привести к тому, что твоя машина попросту взорвётся. Пытаясь вбиться в машину противника, ты добьёшься того, что его машина подлетит, подскачет и т.п.; Врезавшись в какой-либо столб, он в лучшей случае просто растворится, в худшем - полетит в небо или провалится в землю.
   Из этого всего можно сделать вывод, что нам подсунули УГ, вместо второй части, которая для своего времени была потрясающей. Не тратьте свои время и деньги на эту ""игру"", особенно если вы играли в предыдущие игры серии.","What did they even give me?
The second game was simply the best racing game I've ever played. But, to my deepest regret, Team 6 Studios decided to take on the third game. And what happened? The graphics and soundtrack are worse than in FlatOut 2 and FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage; the interface is truly pathetic. Races begin with nitro, which refills automatically, completely ruining the game's crash potential—the very thing that made the FlatOut series so beloved.
We could talk about the physics in the game forever, but everything I'd say leans toward the fact that it simply DOESN'T exist. The slightest hit against a wall can cause your car to explode. Trying to ram into an opponent's car will only result in their car flying up, bouncing, etc.; If it crashes into a pole, it will, at best, simply dissolve; at worst, it will fly into the sky or fall into the ground.
From all this, we can conclude that we were given a piece of crap instead of the second part, which was amazing for its time. Don't waste your time or money on this ""game,"" especially if you've played the previous games in the series."

17998821,german,2015.08.12 17:39,❌,✅,0.5238095522,1,"Dieses ""Flatout"" müsste eigentlich schon als Betrug deklariert werden. Wer wie ich die beiden Vorgänger kennt und diese mag, wird hier sowas von auf den Kopf gestoßen, dass es schmerzt. Da habe ich mich wirklich vom Titel und den Trailern täuschen lassen - bei einem Rennspiel kann man eh nicht viel falsch machen, dachte ich mir. Weit gefehlt!
Nun zum Spiel in Stichworten:
- Masse statt Klasse: viele Strecken, Spielmodi und Fahrzeuge machen KEIN gutes Spiel, wenn sie derart lieblos zusammengestückelt werden
- Realismus: nein, ein Fun-Racer muss nicht gerade realistisch sein, aber es sollte sich so anfühlen. Gerade die Vorgänger zeigten, wie man realistische Umgebungen mit abgedrehten Stunts kombiniert
- Stichwort Stunts: eines der Highlights war immer der Stunt-Modus, in dem man in verschiedenen sport-ähnlichen Disziplinen Punkte sammeln konnte. Sogar meine Frau hat hier die eine oder andere Partie mitgespielt. Hier wurde aus diesem Modus nur noch ein verbugtes Grundgerüst belassen. Kein ""Sport"" mehr, sondern nur noch ""Schrott""
- Steuerung: k a t a s t r o p h a l ! ! ! Ich kann mich grundsätzlich mit nicht-eingängigen Steuerungen arrangieren und spielte auch Dark Souls ohne Gamepad, aber was hier abgeht, ist nicht mal mehr als Witz zu bezeichnen. Ungenau, hakelig, fühlt sich unecht und hektisch an - Präzsion unmöglich. Und das bei einem Rennspiel, wo es um Sekundenbruchteile gehen kann.
- Grafik: gar nicht mal so übel, aber dennoch schlechter als die der beiden Vorgänger, wo man sich noch um Design und dezente Physikeffekte benüht hat. hier eckt man einfach ständig irgendwo an und sieht von der eigenen Karre eigentlich nur das Geflimmer des Respawns. 
- Sound: nicht besonderes, was man ja auch nicht unbedingt erwartet. Dass das aber besser geht, haben ebenfalls schon Teil 1 und 2 gezeigt.
- Preis: FRECHHEIT! Ich konnte das Spiel immerhin zu 80% vergünstigt erwerben, aber selbst dieser Betrag ist mir zu schade. 
- Spieldesign: kein Karrieremodus (bzw. hier: gewinn jedes Rennen mit Platz 1 und es geht weiter; sonst eben nicht!), keine Motivation für Tuning, kein Spaß, es sei denn, man findet es witzig, ständig zu versagen, weil nichts funktioniert, keine Eingängigkeit - NICHTS! Nur ein hingeklatschtes Sammelsurium aus geklauten Ideen, die schlecht umgesetzt sind.
Fazit: ich WARNE hiermit ausdrücklich vor diesem Spiel. Was hier für den Vollpreis geboten wird, ist frech und gehört boykottiert. Keine Ahnung, was die Entwickler gesoffen haben, als sie sich ans Gamedsign setzten, aber es hat ihnen definitiv nicht gut getan. FINGER WEG!
Empfehlung für gute Fun-Racer: Flatout 1 und 2, Burnout Paradise oder das meiner Meinung nach unterschätzte Crashday, das auch seine Macken hat, aber hundertfach besser spielbar ist, als dieses Machwerk



","This ""flatout"" should really be declared a scam. Anyone like me who knows and likes the two predecessors will be so stunned by this that it hurts. I was really fooled by the title and the trailers – I thought you can't go wrong with a racing game anyway. Far from it!
Now, the game in brief:
- Quantity over quality: Many tracks, game modes, and vehicles do NOT make a good game when they are so carelessly pieced together.
- Realism: No, a fun racer doesn't have to be realistic, but it should feel that way. The predecessors in particular showed how to combine realistic environments with crazy stunts.
- Speaking of stunts: one of the highlights was always the stunt mode, where you could score points in various sport-like disciplines. Even my wife played a game or two. This mode has been reduced to a buggy basic structure. No longer ""sporty,"" but just ""junk""
- Controls: catastrophic! ! ! I can generally deal with nonsensical controls and even played Dark Souls without a gamepad, but what's going on here isn't even a joke. Inaccurate, clunky, feels fake and hectic - precision is impossible. And that's in a racing game where fractions of a second can count.
- Graphics: Not bad at all, but still worse than those of the two predecessors, where they still made an effort with design and subtle physics effects. Here, you're constantly bumping into something and all you really see from your own car is the flickering of the respawn.
- Sound: nothing special, which isn't exactly what you'd expect. But parts 1 and 2 have already shown that it can be better.
- Price: RUDE! I was able to purchase the game at an 80% discount, but even that amount is too precious for me.
- Game design: no career mode (or rather, in this case: win every race with first place and you move on; otherwise, nothing!), no motivation for tuning, no fun unless you find it funny to constantly fail because nothing works, no catchiness - NOTHING! Just a slapped-together collection of stolen ideas that are poorly implemented.
Conclusion: I hereby expressly WARN against this game. What's being offered here for full price is outrageous and should be boycotted. I have no idea what the developers were drinking when they sat down to design this game, but it definitely didn't do them any good. STAY AWAY!
Recommendations for good fun racers: Flatout 1 and 2, Burnout Paradise, or the, in my opinion, underrated Crashday, which also has its flaws, but is a hundred times more playable than this piece of work.

Anche se non perfetti i primi capitoli vantavano una buona gestione dei contatti, una fisica interessante in cui l’auto rispondeva diversamente a seconda dell’inclinazione del salto e della differente viscosità dei tracciati. Questo terzo capitolo puntava su elementi di contorno rispetto alla guida: modalità zombie, in salsa Carmageddon, Monster Truck a dirigere instabili barili esplosivi e la già vista modalità Stunt Man…divertimento che in teoria poteva anche indirizzare il brand verso una maggiore specificità e originalità…peccato che la fisica dei mezzi e il comparto tecnico in generale cadano a picco rendendo frustrante l’esperienza di gioco.

[b]Gameplay:[/b] sembra di giocare ad un autoscontro. Agli avversari non sembrerebbe importare di puntare alla vittoria sul tracciato; vogliono solo la vostra pelle: vi vengono addosso buttandovi fuori strada senza criterio. 
E’ un arcade puro, lo dimostra la Supermove: un’abilità che si rende disponibile allorquando avrete caricato in pieno la barra del turbo, effettuando azioni spettacolari come salti, sorpassi a fil di lamiera, ecc…quest’abilità dona l’immunità a qualsivoglia danno, una barriera degna del più potente dei maghi…il prezzo da pagare sarà però un’auto ingovernabile, come se fosse una forza senza freni.
Il peso e le 4 caratteristiche delle auto (velocità, maneggevolezza, accelerazione e resistenza) non contano. Le diverse categorie si comportano allo stesso modo. In alcune modalità di gara le auto si scontrano fra di loro mimando piroette di fuochi d’artificio, regalandovi una facile prima posizione.

Modalità: classica Corsa; Stunt Man, ove fiondarsi di gran carriera su ostacoli di diverso genere ed espellere prima del contatto del mezzo il malcapitato pilota per farlo atterrare in una zona sicura (una modalità divertente sulla carta che si scontra con un’ottimizzazione scadente rendendo i voli dello stunt assolutamente imprevedibili); Speed, una sorta di Formula 1 simile alla classica corsa se non fosse per l’incredibile velocità raggiunta che rende ingovernabile l’auto; Monster Truck, ove portare a spasso barili di benzina e avversari in cui il terreno si trasformerà in una battaglia senza eguali in cui subirete attacchi a 360°; Big Battle, in cui provocare ingenti quantitativi di danni; Nightshift dove vengono riproposte le modalità precedenti riviste in notturna e in condizioni atmosferiche “proibitive”; Challenge, che si limiterà solamente a concatenare i diversi eventi presenti nelle altre, e la già citata modalità in cui investire zombie…
Manca la modalità Carriera, tipica dei giochi arcade, dove mettere in essere la competizione; quindi le piste e le auto andranno sbloccate con i punteggi realizzati sui tracciati già disponibili…peccato che a volte non vengano registrate le nostre performance, costringendoci a ripetere la gara.

[b]I.A:[/b] non credo sia stata nemmeno presa in considerazione. Gli avversari, come su citato, non si preoccupano di vincere anzi commettono errori grossolani e si fanno superare agevolmente.

[b]Comparto grafico:[/b] animazioni scadenti, modelli poligonali dei mezzi di scarso impatto visivo, level design ambientale privo di fascino.

[b]Comparto tecnico:[/b] presenti bug di varia natura che costringono a ripetuti riavvii; il frame rate crolla in presenza di numerosi scontri tra auto; la fisica dei contatti non è pervenuta, i Controlli mostrano lag e imprecisioni…a completare il quadro ci sono: compenetrazione poligonale, texture in bassa definizione, tearing e aliasing marcato.

[b]Comparto audio:[/b] pessimo nell’effettistica; i rombi, o meglio i rumori delle 4 ruote non assomigliano a nessun suono udito su questa Terra.

[b]Commento finale:[/b] purtroppo ci troviamo di fronte ad un pessimo prodotto che forse diventerà un cult del trash come “Rambo the Video Game”...se volete farvi 2 risate allora…no, forse non conviene neanche in questo caso; desistete.

[/h1]

Although not perfect, the first installments boasted good contact management, interesting physics in which the car responded differently depending on the angle of the jump and the varying viscosity of the tracks. This third installment focused on elements surrounding the driving: zombie mode, à la Carmageddon, monster trucks steering unstable explosive barrels, and the already-seen Stunt Man mode...fun that in theory could also push the brand toward greater specificity and originality...too bad the vehicle physics and the technical aspects in general plummet, making the gaming experience frustrating.

[b]Gameplay:[/b] It feels like playing bumper cars. Opponents don't seem to care about aiming for victory on the track; They're after you: they'll charge you, throwing you off the road recklessly.
It's pure arcade, as demonstrated by the Supermove: an ability that becomes available once you've fully charged the boost bar, allowing you to perform spectacular feats like jumps, near-metallic overtaking, etc. This ability grants immunity to any damage, a barrier worthy of the most powerful wizard... the price you pay, however, is an uncontrollable car, as if it were a force without brakes.
The weight and four car characteristics (speed, handling, acceleration, and resistance) don't matter. The different categories behave in the same way. In some race modes, the cars crash into each other, mimicking fireworks pirouettes, giving you an easy first place.

Mode: Classic Race; Stunt Man, where you hurtle over various obstacles at full speed and eject the unfortunate driver before the vehicle hits the ground to land them in a safe area (a fun mode on paper, but with poor optimization, making the stunts completely unpredictable); Speed, a sort of Formula 1 similar to a classic race except for the incredible speeds reached, which make the car uncontrollable; Monster Truck, where you carry barrels of gasoline and opponents, where the terrain transforms into an unparalleled battle where you'll be subjected to 360° attacks; Big Battle, where you inflict massive amounts of damage; Nightshift, where the previous modes are revisited at night and in ""prohibitive"" weather conditions; Challenge, which simply links together the various events present in the other modes; and the aforementioned mode where you run over zombies...
The Career mode, typical of arcade games, where you can compete, is missing; So the tracks and cars will be unlocked with the scores achieved on the already available tracks... it's a shame that sometimes our performances aren't recorded, forcing us to repeat the race.

[b]AI:[/b] I don't think it was even considered. The opponents, as mentioned above, aren't concerned with winning; instead, they make gross errors and are easily overtaken.

[b]Graphics:[/b] Poor animations, visually poor polygonal vehicle models, and lackluster environmental level design.

[b]Technical:[/b] Various bugs force repeated restarts; the frame rate plummets when there are numerous car collisions; collision physics isn't there, the controls show lag and inaccuracies... to complete the picture, there are: polygonal interpenetration, low-definition textures, tearing, and pronounced aliasing.

[b]Sound:[/b] terrible sound effects; the rumbles, or rather the noises of the four wheels, are unlike any other sound ever heard on this Earth.

[b]Final comment:[/b] Unfortunately, we're faced with a terrible product that might become a trash cult classic like ""Rambo the Video Game""...if you want a laugh, then...no, maybe it's not worth it either; give up.

Нужно ПОСТАРАТЬСЯ, чтобы сделать все НАСТОЛЬКО ПЛОХО.
Прекрасный показатель качества работы над этой игрой - ее же первая гоночная трасса. Она представляет из себя ПОЧТИ целиком квадрат с редкими поворотами под 90 градусов, но эти небольшие участки сейравно такие же прямые. Достаточно увидеть один раз и все сразу становится понятно.
Система повреждений полностью в неадеквате. Вне зависимости от скорости и угла врезания дамаг наносится смехотворно-низкий и теже арены на выживание получаются из-за этого настоящей мукой (в плане затраченного времени, а не сложности).
Трюкачества с выбрасыванием водилы страдают от хренового левелдизайна и тугих условий победы. Просто просят ПОПАСТЬ В ЦЕНТР ЦЕЛИ и сделать это при тянущем блевать расположении целей, которые сначала попробуй найди, а потом пойми как добраться/долететь, ведь всегда что-то будет мешать.
Вдобавок, пародийные водилы вроде Чувака из Постала, Вин(т)а Дизеля, Агента 47, Марио и бабы Джокера, которую он френдзонит (Харли Квинн) заодно с машинами, явно основанными на реальных прототипах с более ""говорящими названиями"" (обычная практика для гоночек, однако).
Покупать ни в коем случае не стоит, даже в упаковке со всеми Флатаутами(я даже взяв со скидкой 80% думаю ""лучше бы чипсы купил""), которые по Стиму через сеть даже не работали в отличие от этой провальной 3 части от других разработчиков.","It takes SO MUCH TRY to make everything THIS BAD.
A great indicator of the quality of work on this game is its very first race track. It's ALMOST entirely square with the occasional 90-degree turn, but these small sections are still perfectly straight. Just see it once and everything becomes immediately clear.
The damage system is completely inadequate. Regardless of speed and impact angle, damage is ridiculously low, making even survival arenas a real pain (in terms of time spent, not difficulty).
The driver-ejecting tricks suffer from poor level design and tight victory conditions. They simply ask you to HIT THE CENTER OF THE TARGET, and to do so with targets that are so awkwardly placed that you have to first try to find them, and then figure out how to get there, because something will always get in the way. Plus, there are parody drivers like the Postal Dude, Vin(t) Diesel, Agent 47, Mario, and the Joker's friend-zoned woman (Harley Quinn), along with cars clearly based on real-life prototypes with more descriptive names (a common practice in racing games, though).
You shouldn't buy it under any circumstances, even in the package with all the Flatouts (even with an 80% discount, I'm thinking ""I'd rather have bought chips""), which didn't even work on Steam, unlike that disastrous 3rd installment from other developers."

A Engine, tanto física quando gráfica é uma droga. O FO2 consegue ser mais antigo e mais avançado, mais bem elaborado que isso.

Sinceramente, não vale nem um centavo. A Team6 pegou o jogo da BugBear e massacrou tudo que podia. Esse jogo é tudo, exceto um ""FlatOut"". Ainda bem que a BugBear retornou e salvou tudo fazendo o FO: Ultimate Carnage (o quarto jogo), que é, antes de mais nada, um remake maravilhoso do FO2.

Comprei ele no FlatOut Complete Pack, porque julguei ser tão bom quanto os demais, mas se soubesse, teria comprado tudo à parte.

Se eu pudesse dar uma nota à esse jogo, daria -50, que é o preço que ele vale atualmente. Além de ser o FlatOut mais caro entre os 4, é o pior deles.","I played the first FlatOut and loved it. Then I played FlatOut 2, and loved it even more. But FlatOut 3 simply disappointed me, and I dare say it disappointed ALL FlatOut fans.
The engine, both physics and graphics, is rubbish. FO2 manages to be older and more advanced, more well-crafted than this.

Honestly, it's not worth a dime. Team6 took BugBear's game and butchered everything they could. This game is everything but a ""FlatOut."" Thankfully, BugBear came back and saved everything by making FO: Ultimate Carnage (the fourth game), which is, first and foremost, a wonderful remake of FO2.

I bought it in the FlatOut Complete Pack because I thought it was as good as the others, but if I had known, I would have bought everything separately.

If I could give this game a rating, I would give it a -50, which is its current price. Besides being the most expensive FlatOut among the 4, it is the worst of them."

The game has graphics worse than Flatout 1, driveability worse than Flatout 1, a damage model worse than Sony's F1 2005-2009 (and that was horrible) and looks like a game made in....1998 at best. No, even the Half Life 1 graphics were better. 1996, 1997? For the Dutch in my list, it looks like A2 Racer. The first one.

Just one race, but enough to scrape the pieces of my Flatout memory to what it was after Ultimate Carnage. Don't buy, and if you do, I hope you are buying the other 3 Flatouts with it, because this game should pay you to have you play it.

Contra:
- keine Musik während der rennen
- schlechte, teilweise kaum erkennbare Schadensmodelle
- erbärmliche KI
- eine Engine die beschissener nicht sein könnte

Edit: 
Im Trailer kann man bei einigen Crashes die Ragdolls der Fahrer durch den Boden ihrer Wagen fallen sehen.","Cool music, realistic damage models, good AI, a good engine, very good graphics, good sounds, and a lot of fun.
These are all things I associated with the Flatout series until I played this pile of garbage.

Here's a pros and cons list for this piece of crap, which in my opinion shouldn't be called Flatout, as the series would probably have preferred to bury itself rather than end like this.

Cons:
- No music during races
- Poor, sometimes barely recognizable damage models
- Pathetic AI
- An engine that couldn't be any worse
- Graphics that even put PS1 games off
- Horrid sounds
- Not a single bit of fun

Pros:
+ Uninstalling is quick!

I bought this pile of junk with all the other parts of the series in a bundle for €7.99 and recommend everyone buy the games individually and skip this one. I played Flatout 2 on the PS2, it was my favorite game, and now I've played this garbage and I regret it, as it ruined the Flatout series for me.

3 месяца назад кинулся, а диску хана пришла за это время. Зашел вчера в стим...а тут за копейки все части...

Притензий к графике и физике нет, потому что это треш). В тот момент, когда игра вышла - меня поразила её оптимизация, потому что я играл на ""Ультра"" с железом: MB Foxconn P43A, CPU Celeron DC 3,7GHZ(без разгона 3), RAM DDR2 2GB 800(+тайминги), VGA GF GT8600 256mb. И через месяц сменив проц на C2D 3,2GHZ(дефолт) и видюху на GF GTS250 512mb офигел от плавности работы игры.

Но по-видимому в Стиме и в рознице продавались разные игры... 
Я не просто так задел тему железа...сейчас у меня MB GB Z77-D3H, CPU Core i5 3,4GHZ (дефолт 2,7), RAM DDR3 8Gb 1866(+тайминги), VGA GF GTX750 2Gb. Согласен, что железо скромное, но на средних настройках fps 5-7? Вы издеваитесь? 

Возможно, это отсутствие поддержки Windows 7 x64, потому что тогда у меня стояла Windows 7 x86...но я играл в эту игру на  Windows XP x64...или это отсутствие поддержки железок? Ладно пропустим это...меня задолбало сообщение, что недоступного индекса производительности!!! Невозможно зайти в дополнительные настройки графики.

Я мог поверить, что игра так гонит...и скачал игру сами понимаете откуда. И там нету этих глюков...игра летает. Так что это глюки версии в стиме. 

Игре 8/10, стиму 0/10.","I've always loved the Flatout series for its absurdity. And when the third installment came out, I loved it...it was unique.

I jumped on it three months ago, but the disc was already ruined. I logged into Steam yesterday...and all the installments are available for next to nothing...

I have no complaints about the graphics or physics, because they're trash. When the game came out, I was amazed by its optimization, because I was playing on Ultra with the following hardware: MB Foxconn P43A, CPU Celeron DC 3.7 GHz (without overclocking 3), RAM DDR2 2GB 800 (+ timings), VGA GF GT8600 256 MB. A month later, after upgrading to a C2D 3.2 GHz (default) and a GPU to a GF GTS250 512 MB, I was blown away by how smoothly the game ran.

But apparently, Steam and retail sold different games...
I didn't just broach the subject of hardware... I currently have a MB GB Z77-D3H, a Core i5 3.4GHz CPU (default 2.7), 8GB 1866 DDR3 RAM (+ timings), and a 2GB GTX750 GF VGA. I agree that the hardware is modest, but at medium settings, the fps is 5-7? Are you kidding me?

Perhaps it's the lack of Windows 7 x64 support, because I was running Windows 7 x86 at the time... but I played this game on Windows XP x64... or is it the lack of hardware support? Okay, let's skip that... I'm fed up with the message about the unavailable performance index!!! I can't access the advanced graphics settings.

I could believe the game was running so fast... so I downloaded the game from you know where. And it doesn't have these glitches... the game runs great. So it's a glitch in the Steam version.

Since when do they give an achievement for death - if CS:GO gave an achievement, for example, for the first time a terrorist killed you, you would be proud of it!!! There is also an achievement like ""knocked down one zombie"" and that it was the first time you got into a car - so you can talk about eternity - that was crap, it's time to talk about health. When we play Flatout and Flatout 2, we don't care how much damage we do, but here even that is - I'll explain, this is complete ....... You can talk I'm talking about this, but I don't have the energy to write it. And the last graphic is really cool - HA-HA-HA-HA-HA I was joking, it's also crap. That's all I wanted to say. Like, subscribe to the channel, and remember that you're not alone, there's also DOTA 2."

So I bought the Flatout Game Collection, which is: FlatOut 1, 2, Ultimate Carnage, and I forgot about that :/. So, I start the game, the menu appears, I go to the options, and that's probably the only advantage of this game, which is the options. Before the races, we choose our character, which has a different model and name, and nothing changes at all. Then, tuning, any car is the same, only the model differs, and there are no options for upgrading the car's components. It's time for the game modes, this is an important part of Flatout, because from the first part of the game there have always been, for example, Normal Race, Stunt Man, and the most important one is Destruction Derby, which means you can completely destroy everything. Racing, which is a regular campaign, okay, this mode is fine. I start the first track, facepalms fly, I start driving and try to drive this thing, but it slips like a cardboard box on ice, and the grip The car's contact with the ground is very strong, meaning they turn sharply. The physics are laughable; cars bounce back like balloons a few meters. The graphics are crap, the cherry on the cake. The models are pretty bad, the environments look awful, and the graphical effects are a complete joke. And all of this is exacerbated by the blur, which is the worst blur in the history of racing games. The audio doesn't save this at all; the music is ear-bleeding. The AI ​​is a complete disaster; I don't know what else to say about this crap. And then there's the compatibility, which doesn't stand out from other aspects of this game.

Let me tell you one thing: don't buy this game for anything, even if someone gives it to you for free, don't buy it. Besides, at €27.99, you people are kidding.

Pros +
-Extensive Options
-Quickly Uninstalls
-One mode had potential...
Cons -
-But it's still bad :/

Pero predomina los defectos: En primer lugar, los graficos son muy inferiores al flatout 2. Los requisitos graficos son una bestialidad. Segundo: Los autos son de goma, asi es, ahora no hay diferencia si usas una lamborgini o un monster truck, apenas le golpeas la rueda y sale volando a 50 metros delante tuyo. tercero: el sistema de daños es asqueroso: si chocas con una monster truck a una ferrari, sufre el doble o mueres buggeado en una esquina, en una grieta, hasta inclusive: EN LA VEREDA. W T F ?. Si golpeas con un fiat a una chevy, la camioneta muere aplastada por el auto ¿que se fumaron para darle tan buena inercia?.
 Lo bueno: Tantos bugs te hacen descojonar de lo patetico que es. Tiene muy buenos desafios como por ejemplo: tirar a nuestro conductor por unas escaleras para ganar puntos, usar su cuerpo para jugar al golf, un rally en donde puedes ganar causando daños, saltos y si es posible, matando a todos los competidores. PERO LO MAS IMPORTANTE: ZOMBIES PARA ATROPELLAR. Asi es, ahora esto no es flatout, es carmageddon pirata.","Despite the bad reviews, I had a pretty good time with this game. But the flaws predominate: First, the graphics are far inferior to Flatout 2. The graphics requirements are insane. Second, the cars are made of rubber. That's right. Now, it makes no difference whether you're using a Lamborghini or a monster truck. You barely hit the wheel and it flies 50 meters in front of you. Third, the damage system is disgusting: if you crash a monster truck into a Ferrari, it suffers twice as much or you get bugged out on a corner, in a crevice, or even on the sidewalk. WTF? If you crash a Fiat into a Chevy, the truck is crushed by the car. What did they think of to give it such good inertia?
The good: So many bugs make you laugh at how pathetic it is. It has some great challenges, such as throwing our driver down a flight of stairs to score points, using his body to play golf, and a rally where you can win by causing damage, jumping, and, if possible, killing all the competitors.

Performance-wise it runs stable and smooth for me, although I have heard of people experiencing frequent crashes. The game doesn't look as good as Flatout Ultimate Carnage, but it's still about average (for its time).

The AI seems to be flawed, which hurts the most in Destruction Derbys, where basically all of the AI Competitors only chase the player. You can only avoid this by constantly fleeing and only targeting isolated AI drivers. In normal races AI drivers can go full retard when falling back too far, which can be dangerous when lapping them, but is rather amusing to watch after finishing the race.

To summarize, Flatout 3 is a playable arcade racer that doesn`t require experience with racing games, so it could be worth a try for casual gamers that don't play too often. I would however recommend to wait for one of the many 90% discounts, as this game isn't really worth 30 bucks.","This game isn`t really a Flatout game, I have to admit that.

PROS[list]
[*]many vehicles & driver models
  -makes me feel like I'm playing a poor-man's Twisted Metal
[*]unlockable vehicles, modes, & maps make it more addictive
  -I wish I could tell you my favorite vehicle, but that would SPOIL it
[*]Multiplayer (for up to 16 players).
[*]Single Player offers good # of game settings to change to your liking (# of AI cars, game speed, & difficulty)
[*]bigger, interesting levels
  -Moscow, bowl-shaped fields, big frozen lake, rolling hills in the desert, the list goes on!
[*]boosting for 3+ seconds repairs your vehicle to an extent & is an interesting mechanic
[*]many levels.
  -even looking at each individual mode, there are a lot of maps to play
[*]Explosions send you FLYING through the air
   -it's fun. it may be unrealistic, as if there's low gravity, but it's funny/fun to watch IMO
[/list]

CONS[list]
[*]no career mode ('Challenge' is the closest thing with its linear progress)
[*]handling feels off & other cars seem to STICK to you
[*]No AI in multiplayer (originally I thought there was, so I'm very sorry if I mislead anyone)
[*]unoptimized (ie: bad frame rate) 
   -depending on the map & your PC setup. Scroll to the bottom for my FIX for this.
[*]car deformation is worse than in other FlatOuts
[*]controls can only be changed/checked via settings, off the main menu
   -just like the other FlatOuts, but is still a bad design choice.
[*]Offroad mode only has 4 levels 
   -the most-fun mode IMO. technically 2, since 2 of them are the same map, just reversed.
[*]disconnects: I have experienced disconnect from the server about 20% of the time & it usually happens as I'm loading up -trying to transfer from- the Lobby to the map. TL;DR= You may have problems playing multiplayer, it just depends on your computer. (fyi, I've tested multiplayer both as host and not- both cause me to crash; I'm not sure why. I need to do further testing on my PC)
[/list]


[u]TL;DR=[/u]
Bigger derby levels versus MORE opponents,
more cars, less customization, less optimized, 
but still a fun game if you just want to have fun and can look past the flaws.


NOTE: I would recommend this ONLY if you spent about $2 or less for this game (as I paid $7.99 for the bundle); but the $30 base retail price is a rip-off.

----------------------------------------------------
[u]Technical issues[/u]
This game was inconsistent for me.
Sometimes the load times were long, running off a HDD.
Performance was terrible on SOME levels -if running off a Hard Disk Drive; I was getting as low as 6 fps on the 1st SplatOut map.

But...when I ran it off a SSD, somehow it magically worked much much better for me & I suddenly got an average frame-rate well over 100 on Ultra. (I had my resolution down at 1180x800, fyi.)

Overall, it's average, like many others. 4/10 is the highest rating I can give it. You can pull off smashes and the like with impressive performance, but the overpowered AI won't let you win the race so easily, especially in a destruction derby where all the cars are rushing at you like idiots.

O tej grze można powiedzieć dobrego tylko pod względem graficznym, gra nawet ładnie wygląda. Wszystko inne wkurza niż zachęca.

ЭТОТ КУСОК БЫЧЕГО ДЕРЬМА НЕ СТОИТ ДАЖЕ МИЗИНЦА 2 ЧАСТИ !

Начнём с графики.
Тупо мыло, размазаное по экрану, блевотные размытости, туманы и увеличение угла обзора при нитро выглядят уе*ищно. даже в 1 части графон лучше.
Машины будто из картона : легко разбиваются и эффект разбивания хуже даже чем в GTA San Andreas.

Музыка.
ЕЁ ТУТ НЕТ, БЛ*ТЬ ! РЕАЛЬНО ! ТОЛЬКО 1 САУНДТРЕК В МЕНЮ ! ВСЁ, БЛ* !

Геймплей.
Оо, это отдельная история. Запустил 1 гонку, РАЗБИЛСЯ ЧЕРЕЗ НЕСКОЛЬКО СЕКУНД ПОСЛЕ СТАРТА ! ВСЁ СЛУЧИЛОСЬ НАСТОЛЬКО БЫСТРО, ЧТО Я ДАЖЕ НЕ СООБРАЗИЛ ЧТО СЛУЧИЛОСЬ ! И ТАК ВСЮ ГОНКУ ! Я ТУПО РАЗБИВАЛСЯ И РАЗБИВАЛСЯ ! 

Режимы.

Гонка :
Очень однообразно. Едешь, разбиваешся, ""PRESS 'R' TO RESTART"", едешь, разбиваешся... И так до конца трассы.

Каскадёр :
Я, бл*ть так и не понял, как в эту хуйню играть. Всё настолько кривожопо сделано, что без кепа мне не обойтись, но я лучше в UC поиграю.

Большая битва : 
Дерби. Только для мултиплеера. Ах да.. НИКТО НЕ БУДЕТ ИГРАТЬ В ЭТО ДЕРЬМО !

Боевая арена :
Да да, это классическое дерби, но его тоже про*бали !
ГДЕ НИТРО ?! ПОЧЕМУ МАШИНЫ ПОЧТИ НЕ РАЗБИВАЮТСЯ ?! КАКОГО Х*Я НУЖНО ТАРАНИТЬ МАШИНЫ, ЧТОБЫ ПОЛУЧАТЬ ОЧКИ, А НЕ РАЗБИВАТЬ ИХ ?!

Грузовики-монстры : 
Надеялся что что-то норм, но нет. Скучно.

Скорость :
Гонки на Формулах-1. Вот это ещё более менее, только не шарю, КАКОГО Х*Я ЭТО В ФЛЭТАУТЕ ?!

Ночная смена :
Та же гонка, те же трассы, только ночью !!! АХ*ЕТЬ НОЧЬ ! ВОТЭТОДА ! ПРОСТО ЗАМЕЧАТЕЛЬНО, БЛ*ТЬ.

Бездорожье :
Скуууучноооо.

SplatOut :
ДААА ! ЗОМБИ !!! МЯСО !!! А х*й вам !
Всё через жопу
Зомби стоят на месте, огромные как хз что. Карты баганые и маленькие. Зомбей очень мало и давить их скучно, потому-что не двигаются.
1 карту я прошёл вообще не поняв что случилось, тупо ехал вперёд и иногда поворачивал.
Но на 2 началось веселье. 1 раз играя я через несколько секунд застрял в текстурах. Чтож, решил ещё немного поездить, перезапустил. Немного позбивая зомбей, я наехал на какую-то небольшую гору из 3-4 бусиков, и.. УЛЕТЕЛ В НЕБО, БЛ*ТЬ !!!
После этого, я выключил игру, и удалил её на*уй с компютера.

Не играйте в это дерьмо, даже на пиратке, это издевательство над великой серией. 2/10.","I absolutely love the first three games; they're fantastic. The gameplay, the soundtrack, the graphics, and tons of meat and metal. BUT THIS!!!
THIS PIECE OF BULLSHIT IS NOT WORTH EVEN THE LITTLE FINGER OF PART 2!

Let's start with the graphics.
The blurry images smeared across the screen, the vomit-inducing blurriness, the fog, and the increased field of view with nitro look absolutely stunning. Even the graphics in Part 1 are better.
The cars look like they're made of cardboard: they crash easily, and the crash effect is worse than even GTA San Andreas.

Music.
IT'S NOT HERE, FUCKING! REALLY! ONLY ONE SOUNDTRACK IN THE MENU! THAT'S IT!

Gameplay.
Oh, that's a whole other story. I started the first race and CRASHED A FEW SECONDS AFTER I STARTED! EVERYTHING HAPPENED SO FAST THAT I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE WHAT HAPPENS! AND IT HAPPENED THE ENTIRE RACE! I JUST CRASHED AND CRASHED!

Modes.

Race:
Very monotonous. You drive, you crash, ""PRESS 'R' TO RESTART,"" you drive, you crash... And so on until the end of the track.

Stuntman:
I still haven't figured out how to play this crap. Everything is so poorly designed that I can't do without a cap, but I'd rather play UC.

Big Battle:
Deadly Derby. Multiplayer only. Oh yeah... NO ONE WILL PLAY THIS SHIT!

Battle Arena:
Yeah, yeah, it's a classic demolition derby, but they screwed it up too!
WHERE'S THE NITRO?! WHY DO THE CARS HARDLY CRUSH?! WHY THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO RAM CARS TO GET POINTS INSTEAD OF CRUSHING THEM?!

Monster Trucks:
I was hoping for something decent, but nope. Boring.

Speed:
Formula 1 racing. Now that's more or less it, but I don't understand WHY THE HELL IS THIS IN FLATOUT?!

Night Shift:
Same race, same tracks, only at night!!! OH FUCKING NIGHT! OH MY GOD! SIMPLY FUCKING AWESOME.

Off-road:
Booooooooood.

SplatOut:
YESSS! ZOMBIES!!! MEAT!!! Fuck you!
It's all a piece of cake.
The zombies are standing still, huge as who knows what. The maps are buggy and small. There are very few zombies, and running over them is boring because they don't move.
I completed the first map without even realizing what happened, just driving forward and occasionally turning.
But the fun started on the second. The first time I played, I got stuck in the textures after a few seconds. Well, I decided to drive around a bit more, restarted. While smashing the zombies for a bit, I ran into some small mountain of 3-4 minibuses, and... I FLEW INTO THE SKY, FUCKING!!!
After that, I turned off the game and deleted it from my computer.

Don't play this crap, even if you pirate it. It's a mockery of a great series. 2/10."

Честно говоря, когда скачал игру еще в первый раз с торрента, то подумал, что это кто-то залил левую игру или мод на первый FlatOut и переименовал. Когда купил ее на распродаже в Steam вместе с другими то понял, как меня кинули. Уже с первых секунд игры вы поймете всю нищету этой «наследницы франшизы». Ярлык игры дает понять, что над ним не трудились. Меню тоже очень КРУТО сделано (ну вы поняли). Гонки отстой, мало разновидности, нет кампании как в предыдущей части. Режимы какие-то с зомби, ночными сменами и подобной ерундой. Я бы закрыл на все глаза если бы все это имело красивую графику, но терпеть нынешнюю невозможно. Помните трюки из FlatOut 2? Их не просто убили, их расстреляли. Напоминают мини-игру про гольф из Мадагаскара. Игра вышла просто никакой. 
P.S. И почему в Библиотеке Steam только третий FLatOut написан как «FLatout»? «В семье не без урода» - писал LAl7ATKA®","The game developers are lousy. Honestly, when I first downloaded the game from a torrent, I thought someone had uploaded a fake game or mod for the first FlatOut and renamed it. When I bought it on sale on Steam along with others, I realized how screwed I was. From the very first seconds of play, you'll understand the poverty of this ""franchise successor."" The game's shortcut makes it clear that no effort was put into it. The menu is also very COOL (you get the idea). The racing games suck, there's little variety, and there's no campaign like in the previous game. The modes are just some zombies, night shifts, and other such nonsense. I'd overlook all this if all of this had beautiful graphics, but the current ones are unbearable. Remember the stunts from FlatOut 2? They weren't just killed, they were shot. They remind me of a golf minigame from Madagascar. The game is simply terrible. 
P.S. And why is only the third FLatOut listed as ""FLatout"" in the Steam Library? ""There's a black sheep in every family,"" wrote LAl7ATKA®."

I've been wanting to try it for a long time, and now I have the time, and it turned out to be a waste of time! The sounds, the effects, the graphics - which do not change no matter the video settings, I'm not even talking about the characters, they turned out to be complete and utter crap. And there's nothing to say about the cars either, they're like straight out of Sony 1, boxy, pathetic! The competitions are neither interesting nor engaging, the tracks are completely out of place.

Fakten
Pro:
+ coole und viele karren
+ viele modi

Contra:
- kaum karriere
- seltsame kreuzungen/umbauten von echten autos
- sinnlose instrumente
- keine anleitung
- kein nachvollger der flatout serie
-schlechtes Gameplay

Ausführlich:
Habe Flatout3 im bundle mit den anderen Teilen gekauft und die ersten zwei auch gespielt. hab nun den dritten Teil installiert und große Hoffnungen gehabt: bessere grafik, mehr autos,...

Das kam dan beim ersten anspielen heraus:
erstmal über ein schönes menü gefreut und auch relativ coole karren(auch wenn sie teils seltsame kreuzungen oder umbauten sind) gefreut
aber das erste manko gleich vorab keine karriere bzw erstmal nicht ersichtlich 
stuntmission gestartet und erstmal keinen plan was ich machen soll / wohin ich muss, erst nach zigfachen ausprobieren irgendwie geschafft eine mission zu beenden
dann die anderen modi auf LEICHT ausprobiert, dank einer seltsamen steuerung, keiner lebensanzeige und schlechter karte die hölle
dann hab ich auch noch bemerkt das da ein sinnloser drehzalmesser ist, der sich zwar bewegt ,aber dir nichts bringt ,da man nicht selbst schalten kann und auch die geschwindigkeitsanzeige an einer ganz anderen stelle sitz.
letzten endes war ich froh mir das spiel im bundle gekauft zu haben und nicht einzeln.

Fazit:
im angebot kann man dieses spiel kaufen aber kein muss, flatoutliebhaber werden entäuscht sein , schlussendlich hat Team6 wohl versucht eine eierllegende Wollmilchsau hervorzuzaubern aber eher einen zombieschwein geboren","Not a recommendation!!!! for those expecting a Flatout installment!!!!

Facts
Pros:
+ Cool and numerous cars
+ Many modes

Cons:
- Hardly any career options
- Strange crossovers/conversions of real cars
- Pointless instruments
- No instructions
- Not a sequel to the Flatout series
- Poor gameplay

In detail:
I bought Flatout 3 in a bundle with the other installments and played the first two. I've now installed the third installment and had high hopes: better graphics, more cars,...

This is what I discovered when I first played it:
First, I was happy about the nice menu and also the relatively cool cars (even if some of them are strange intersections or conversions).
But the first drawback right from the start: no career, or rather, not immediately apparent.
Started a stunt mission and initially had no idea what to do/where to go. Only after countless attempts did I somehow manage to complete a mission.
Then I tried the other modes on EASY, but thanks to strange controls, no health indicator, and a terrible map, it was hell.
Then I also noticed that there's a pointless rev counter that moves, but doesn't do anything for you, since you can't shift gears yourself, and the speedometer is in a completely different place.
In the end, I was glad I bought the game as a bundle and not separately.

Conclusion:
You can buy this game on sale, but it's not a must. Flatout fans will be disappointed. Ultimately, Team6 may have tried to conjure up a jack-of-all-trades, but they've actually produced a zombie pig."

Хотя ее сложно отнести к этой серии, ибо от флэтаута в этой [strike]куче говна[/strike] игре, разве что название. Не очень понятно по какой причине, по какому стечению обстоятельств разработку третьей части (и вообще права на всю серию) отдали другому издателю и разработчику. Такое ощущение что Team6 даже не пытались сделать что то хотя бы просто нормальное и играбельное. Они просто видимо решили сразу делать треш, пародию или еще что-то по мотивам FlatOut.

В [strike]подгорании и разрывании[/strike] Хаосе и Разрушении отвратительно сделано буквально ВСЁ. Можно начать с любого аспекта игры, ибо хоть какой-то ценности ничто не представляет.

Графика - она убога, Team6 явно не поскупились на повсеместный блюр. Модели машин, окружение, даже интерфейс - прямиком из годов так 2000-х.

Физика у машин не идет ни в какое сравнение с физикой из FlatOut 2 (по моему мнению самой лучшей части серии). Машины здесь ведут себя как куски мыла которые сложно поймать в ванне с водой.

Геймплей хоть и отличается разнообразием режимов, но эти режимы настолько плохо организованы и настолько устарели что опять же ценности не представляют никакой.

ИИ соперников вообще отсутствует как класс.

По саундтреку могу сказать что он был бы неплох в какой нибудь пародийной аркадке родом из 2000-х.

Также довольно спорный момент - это персонажи. Это просто апофеоз вообще всего маразма которым видимо страдают разработчики.

В итоге получаем одну из самых наихудших игр развлекательной индустрии, которую мне было бы стыдно выпустить в свет, в стиме, да еще и по цене в 30 баксов.

Оценка 10 из 10 кусков хозяйственного мыла.","A game that should never have been created. A game that brings shame on the entire FlatOut series. Although it's hard to classify it as part of that series, as the only thing that's FlatOut-esque about this [strike]heap of crap[/strike] game is the name. It's unclear why, or by what coincidence, the development of the third game (and the rights to the entire series) was handed over to another publisher and developer. It feels like Team6 didn't even try to make something decent and playable. They apparently just decided to go straight to making trash, a parody, or something else inspired by FlatOut.

In [strike]burning and tearing[/strike], Chaos and Destruction, literally EVERYTHING is done terribly. You could start with any aspect of the game, as nothing is of any value.

The graphics are pathetic; Team6 clearly didn't skimp on the ubiquitous blurring. The car models, the environments, even the interface – they're straight out of the 2000s.

The car physics are nothing compared to those in FlatOut 2 (in my opinion, the best game in the series). The cars here behave like bars of soap, hard to catch in a bathtub.

The gameplay, while varied, offers so many modes, but they're so poorly organized and outdated that they're worthless.

The opponent AI is completely nonexistent.

Judging by the soundtrack, I can tell it wouldn't be out of place in some parody arcade game from the 2000s.

The characters are also a rather controversial issue. They're simply the pinnacle of the insanity that the developers seem to suffer from.

The end result is one of the worst games in the entertainment industry, one I'd be ashamed to release on Steam, especially at a price of $30.

I played a single race (yes I made it that far, so I earned the right to judge the game). I immediately remembered a really funny parody of the FPS games of that era. Duty Calls. Now for those who aren't familiar with this name, let me describe it briefly. Duty Calls is a parody of many FPS games, based on Call of Duty franchise. It was made as an advertisement for Bulletstorm, whose trailer played at the end of this mocking game, with the message being ""nowadays FPS are like the one you just played, here is what it is supposed to be like (Bulletstorm trailer begins)"". Flatout 3 felt exactly like that. ""Here is a crappy racing game to depict everything wrong with racing games today, and now, real Flatout 3 begins where you get to have super fun just like you had in the previous games, even ultimate carnage, which was basically flatout 2 re-sold to you suckers, but turned out to be pretty good anyway"". Disappointment begins... It was no joke, no ""real"" Flatout 3 started. Flatout 3 really is the horrible.... ummm..... I can't really say that it's a game.... It's...... a software...... where you control...... no not control........ more like........ watch a car that was based on the drawings of a drunk newborn...... cruise in a city designed by a band of autistic apes...... and think that you contribute to its behaviour by pressing certain buttons on the controller.

Ok jokes aside. Graphics are extremely unfinished. Simple and undetailed, but not intentionally, just due to lack of skill and/or effort. Just look at the screenshots. At the first glance they look pretty decent. Now look closer. Inspect details. Don't tell me it's a 2011 game. Compare it to DiRT or just Flatout UC. You will see it has horrible graphics.

Controls just don't matter. You don't feel in control of the vehicle, not even a little bit. The car just goes vroom vroom. No realism, no control, no fun. For those who will bash me for looking for realism, just go play the previous games. You will see what I mean. Junker cars used to slide, drift, bump, etc. Now they just perfectly hover over the asphalt. When you try to turn, it either doesn't turn enough (if you're too fast), or turns successfully (if you're slow enough). It doesn't drift, slide unless you pull the handbrake. But if you use nitro when your car is aligned with the road, it just immediately and magically stops sliding and continues it's hovering over the road. Here is a short list of games that offer a better and more realistic driving experience: Asphalt 8 (iOS and Android), The Need for Speed (1994), FIFA '96. Also, I'm using a Logitech F710. When I set the controls to the gamepad, it stops working. If I set them to keyboard I can use my gamepad with xinput mode. Fuck logic!

Sounds. There are 4 sounds in total. One of them is the menu sound ""click"". Three in game sounds are ""vroom"", ""bfffttt"", and ""dufff"". Now ""vroom"" is the engine sound made by the cars engines. The sound was produced by a pair of bored game devs, that just made the sound with their mouth. I can almost hear one of them saying ""screw the consumers, they will buy our games anyway"", in the middle of the sound recording session, faintly hidden behind the sound of the engine. ""bfffttt"" is the sound nitrous makes, and the artistic creation of this amazing sound was most likely based on an air refresher spray. ""dufff"" is the collision sound used in every single collision to every single combination of objects. Again, it was probably made by devs dropping a heavy pillow from a distance. 

Music. Literally non-existent.

Car tuning. Do you remember the simple, yet fun car modification system Flatout used to offer? It's gone. Here is the new system. ""Would you like to tune the car?"" [Yes/No]. If you choose yes, then the car is ""tuned"" by standards seen fit by the devs. I swear to god, I am laughing at the stupidity of this, as I'm writing, while crying on the inside because it isn't even slightly exaggerated. Ladies and gentlemen, a new era of modification begins where cars are either ""tuned"" or ""aren't"".

Please just watch a single gameplay footage from any source. Even the official game trailers give you an idea of how ridiculous this game is. Don't take any of my word for it. Just look it up on youtube yourself. Watch some videos and see for yourself that every single sentence you read here, is describing that video.

I bought the Complete pack for 10$. I am not sorry because I love Flatout games. I played them on PS2 for long hours. I am glad to have 1, 2 and UC in my steam library for just 10$. But if you want a Flatout game, just buy UC. 2 was better than 1, even though 1 was a pretty solid game itself.

開発会社が変わり、UIがごちゃごちゃ、レーススタート時画面がパーティクルで埋め尽くされる、

どうしてこうなった・・・

今はアップデートによりはまりバグ、パーティクルで画面が埋め尽くされる、操作性などが改善されたが、
今までの3部作知ってしまっていると全然面白くない。。。

シリーズを殺した作品を体験してみたい方だけは買い


余談だが、今までの3部作を開発していたBugbear Entertainmentは[url=www.nextcargame.com]NextCarGame[/url]を発表しています","It was released suddenly, without any notice.
I bought it immediately because it's one of my favorite series.
The developer changed, the UI is cluttered, the screen is filled with particles at the start of a race,
cars get stuck in obstacles and explode, cars get buried in the ground...
How did it end up like this...?

Updates have improved the addictive bugs, particle-filled screens, and control,
but if you're familiar with the previous trilogy, it's not fun at all...

Only buy it if you want to experience the game that killed the series.

Este jogo não tem história. Mas não  é algo que faz falta tratando-se de um jogo de corrida.

A gameplay é horrivel. Os comandos nesse jogo são muito estranho. As pistas não são convidativas. E a dificuldade desse jogo é ridicula de facil. Não é preciso muito esforço pra liberar o melhor carro do jogo. E quando voce fizer isso, esse jogo ta na mão, Pq o carro mais robado do jogo é destravado facilmente. Ha uma boa variedade de carros, mas são tudo sem graça. Não ha mais sistema de upgrades. Este jogo ficou tão ridiculo que da para jogar de tanque no modo derby (destruição). A AI dos oponentes é horrivel. Parece que são zumbis no volante. Não, acho que zumbis conseguiriam dirigir melhor. A física do jogo é horrível.

A trilha sonora do jogo é ok. Rock pesado e do bom. Se voce não gostar da OST do jogo, é possível configura rnos menus do jogo para tocar as musicas do seu PC.

Os cenários são bem variados e uma boa quantidade de pistas. Mas foram sei la kra, mal planejadas. Não ha nada único nas corridas.

Os gráficos não são ruins, mas, eles literalmente pioraram kra. Sem brincadeira, os gráficos do jogo anterior eram mais bonitos.

Ha uma pequena quantidade de bugs e glitchs no jogo tbm.

Esse jogo é tudo de ruim. Tudo vai de mais ou menos a ruim. É horrível. Eu joguei desde o primeiro titulo da série. Flatout sempre foi um jogo excepcional. Gameplay muito boa, AI excelente, muitos mini-games divertidos, carros muito bons com upgrades, gráficos excelentes, além de uma física impecavel e um sistema de destruição único. Esse jogo, não tem nada de FlatOut. É uma vergonha pra série este titulo. Tem jogo de corrida genérico por ae muito melhor que esse jogo. Esse jogo nunca deveria ter existido. E não é porque sou fã da série que digo isso, mesmo avaliando esse jogo como um jogo de corrida genérico, continua sendo uma porcaria. Não recomendo mesmo! Se voce é fã da série, vai se decepcionar MUITO mesmo. E se voce não conhece FlatOut, melhor jogar outro, porque esse aqui é uma porcaria. Sugiro o FlatOut 2 ou FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage. Passe longe desse jogo.","Very bad, really bad. There's no way I can recommend a game like this to anyone. I'll give my usual standard review.

This game has no story. But that's not something that's missing for a racing game.

The gameplay is horrible. The controls in this game are very strange. The tracks are uninviting. And the difficulty of this game is ridiculously easy. It doesn't take much effort to unlock the best car in the game. And once you do, this game is in your hands, because the most stolen car in the game is easily unlocked. There's a good variety of cars, but they're all boring. There's no upgrade system anymore. This game has become so ridiculous that you can play as a tank in derby mode (destruction). The opponent AI is horrible. It feels like zombies behind the wheel. No, I think zombies could drive better. The game's physics are horrible.

The soundtrack is okay. Good, heavy rock. If you don't like the game's OST, you can configure it in the game menus to play your PC's music.

The scenarios are quite varied, and there are a good number of tracks. But they were, I don't know, poorly designed. There's nothing unique about the races.

The graphics aren't bad, but they literally got worse, man. No joke, the previous game's graphics were prettier.

There are a small number of bugs and glitches in the game too.

This game is all bad. Everything ranges from so-so to bad. It's horrible. I've played it since the first title in the series. Flatout has always been an exceptional game. Very good gameplay, excellent AI, lots of fun mini-games, very good cars with upgrades, excellent graphics, impeccable physics, and a unique destruction system. This game has nothing like FlatOut. This title is a disgrace to the series. There are generic racing games out there that are much better than this one. This game should never have existed. And I'm not saying this because I'm a fan of the series. Even though I rate this game as a generic racing game, it's still crap. I really don't recommend it! If you're a fan of the series, you'll be VERY disappointed. And if you're unfamiliar with FlatOut, you'd better play something else, because this one is crap. I suggest FlatOut 2 or FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage. Stay away from this game."

10191470,russian,2014.04.22 01:09,❌,✅,0.5238095522,1,"Все очень ужасно. 1 часть была значительно лучше этой.

Игра получила резко негативные отзывы как от игровых изданий, так и от игроков. Среди прочего отмечается ужасная физика, неудобное управление и слабый искусственный интеллект..

Рейтинг игры на Metacritic среди критиков - 2,3 балла, пользовательский рейтинг - 3,9 балла.


В самом начале прохождения предоставляется возможность пройти небольшое обучение, где игрока ознакомят с базовыми принципами и системой управления. После этого этапа можно переходить к выбору различных режимов, среди которых можно встретить типичные турниры, заезды и соревнования. Авторы игры не стали придерживаться реалистичности в физическом плане, а сделали упор на зрелищность и большое количество разрушений. Во время заезда в любом из режимов предстоит совершать безумные трюки и постоянно бороться с соперниками. Интерактивный мир позволяет разрушать некоторые части трасс и создавать новые преграды.

Для большего разнообразия присутствует несколько дополнительных мини-игр, которые реализованы в шуточной манере. Вы сможете прыгать в воду, играть в боулинг и дартс, используя для этого машину и водителя в качестве инструментов. Изначально игра была реализована для консолей, а потом адаптирована для персональных компьютеров, поэтому потребуется некоторое время, чтобы привыкнуть к управлению на мышке и клавиатуре.","Everything is absolutely terrible. The first game was significantly better than this one.

The game received extremely negative reviews from both gaming publications and players. Among other things, the game's terrible physics, awkward controls, and weak artificial intelligence are noted.

The game has a Metacritic rating of 2.3 stars among critics and a user rating of 3.9 stars.

At the very beginning of the game, the player is given the opportunity to complete a short tutorial, where they are introduced to the basic principles and control system. After this stage, the player can choose from various modes, including typical tournaments, races, and competitions. The game's developers didn't adhere to realistic physics, but instead focused on spectacle and a large amount of destruction. During a race in any mode, you'll perform crazy stunts and constantly battle opponents. The interactive world allows you to destroy parts of the track and create new obstacles.

For added variety, there are several additional mini-games, implemented in a humorous manner. You'll be able to dive, bowl, and play darts, using your car and driver as your tools. The game was originally developed for consoles and later adapted for PC, so it will take some time to get used to the mouse and keyboard controls."

-it crashes, sudden unavoidable and uncontrollable exit of the game (I have everything up to date, but not only for me, but also for others...it just gives an error and crashes)
-bad handling (not sure if this game was supposed to have handling that you would only see in those old car games, really rudimentary and quite disappointing)
-bad graphics (I know I played it on low, but I wasn't expecting to look worse than the first title)
-no community (hmm, I wonder why? *sarcasm* )
-the crashing effects suck (apparently every time you crash, you lose all of your wheels and other unaesthetic looks for the crashing events)
-from what I noticed, it lacks the story part or something related
-the physics are broken most of the time
-limited maps, barely new features compared with the previous titles etc.
-it was not worth the price I paid at the time

+it has wacky looking characters and vehicles, always good for a good laugh (since this entire game is a laughing matter)

And now...for the long and tedious negative list...I could probably just sum it up to: ""It sucks!"", but I will mention just a few of the downgrades (in comparison to it's predecessor it seems lesser of a game) and downfalls of the game:

-it crashes, sudden unavoidable and uncontrollable exit of the game (I have everything up to date, but not only for me, but also for others...it just gives an error and crashes)
-bad handling (not sure if this game was supposed to have handling that you would only see in those old car games, really rudimentary and quite disappointing)
-bad graphics (I know I played it on low, but I wasn't expecting to look worse than the first title)
-no community (hmm, I wonder why? *sarcasm* )
-the crashing effects suck (apparently every time you crash, you lose all of your wheels and other unaesthetic looks for the crashing events)
-from what I noticed, it lacks the story part or something related
-the physics are broken most of the time
-limited maps, barely new features compared with the previous titles etc.
-it was not worth the price I paid at the time

And the list can easily continue for a lot...this is my experience from only an hour or so of gameplay...but, I will still recommend this game, because it really helps you to learn to appreciate what you have and, heck, how knows, you just might enjoy this game while you are drunk or feel like doing something really dumb, so why not keep it close for just those special occasions when you ""dare to be stupid"". This game really deserves it's metacritic score 2/10 ."

Einfach ein schrecklicher Namensmissbrauch und dann haben sie den Namen auch noch falsch geschrieben Flat""O""ut mit großem O und nicht mit kleinem... Schrecklich...
Weiter unten ist eine Pro/Kontra Liste und noch weiter unten werde ich auf die einzelnen Punkte genau eingehen

Ich als FlatOut Fan seit dem ersten Teil bin fast vom Stuhl gefallen als ich dieses Spiel startete... Ok im Menü war es nicht so schlimm aber als dann das Rennen startete... Ich war entsetzt... 
Da kann man auch auf irgendeinem Handheld (nintendo DSLite hat so ein spiel) eine Variante von Hot-Wheels spielen... 

Pro/Kontra Liste:
Man soll ja immer mit [u] Konstruktiver Kritik [/u] anfangen:

- In den Grafikoptionen wird direkt angezeigt was sich dadurch ändert

Mehr hab ich leider nicht... 


[u] Destruktive Kritik: [/u]

- Grafik ist mehr als kitschig
- Grafik ist mehr als schlecht
- Keinen soundtrack mehr in Rennen
- Sounds sind nicht sehr hochwertig
- Schlechte Steuerung

Genaues zu den einzelnen Punkten:
Pro:
- In den Grafikoptionen wird direkt angezeigt was sich dadurch ändert
Also mir gefällt es 
Ich hab auch einen Rechner der sich das leisten kann bei älteren Pc´s kommt man dann schonmal im Menü ins schwitzen aber sonst gefällt es mir

Kontra:
- Grafik ist kitschig
Wenn man FlatOut 2 mit Flatout 3 vergleicht kann man feststellen das die Grafik in FlatOut 2 eher natürlich ist und in Flatout 3 ist sie auf dem Niveau eines Kinderspiels... einfach erbärmlich

- Grafik ist schlecht
Also ich hab direkt auf den höchsten Einstellungen angefangen zu spielen und muss sagen... Half Life 2 ist von 2004 und hat bessere Grafik... Keine ahnung ich konnte wegen dieser leuchtend hellen Farben nicht viel erkennen aber auch die ""Dummys"" die aus den Autos crashen können sind extrem eckig und haben schlechte Kanten 

- Kein Soundtrack in Rennen
Vieleicht ist da ja doch einer aber er ist mir nicht aufgefallen... Bei den ersten beiden spielen is der Soundtrack aufgefallen weil es sehr gute Rock-Musik war und bei diesem Teil der reihe... also ich hab nix wahrgenommen

- Keine hochwertigen Sounds
Als ich mein erstes Event gestartet habe ist mir direkt dieses nervtötende seltsame Brummen aufgefallen nach reiflicher Überlegung und hin und her bin ich zu dem schluss gekommen das es ein Motorengeräusch immitieren soll... Ich berufe mich nochmals auf Half-Life 2 aus dem jahre 2004 und sage das auch nochmal: Dieses Spiel ist schlechter als ein Spiel was 7 jahre zuvor auf den Markt kam

- Schlechte Steuerung
Nun... ob sie nun schlecht ist oder nicht ist jedem selbst überlassen... Da ich sehr gern vergleiche berufe ich mich hier auf FlatOut 2 Bei dem die autos bei zu harten lenkaktionen noch hinten ausgebrochen sind und musss sagen: Wenn es ein Auto mit dieser Bodenhaftung gäbe dann ist das ein Traum für jeden Rennfahrer. Du lenkst nach links und du fährst nach links... ganz einfach ohne irgendwelche Einwände tut dein auto genau das was du ihm sagst es klebt nach links... 


Da dieses Review sehr mit meiner eigenen meinung zusammenhängt und ich sie ein wenig schön verpackt habe, hier nochmal ohne Blatt vorm Mund und Ungekürzt:

[spoiler] Schlechtestes Rennspiel was ich je ""gespielt"" habe, wenn man von gespielt reden kann bei den 5 minuten fahrzeit... 
Ich bin fast hintenrunter gefallen als ich diese Kindergrafik gesehen habe und musste direkt an einen Hot-Wheels teil vom Nintendo DS-Lite denken den ich früher mal gespielt habe... Dann die steuerung... Es war einfach nur zu einfach. Das spiel hat durch diese am boden klebenden Fahrzeuge jeglichen anspruch abgetreten. Ja der sound... auch DS-Lite qualität. Und das dieses spiel von 2011 sein soll kann ich nicht glauben weil es einfach qualitativ schlecht ist... [/spoiler]

Viele grüße und einen schönen Tag/Abend/Nacht wünsch ich euch
Lex","This isn't FlatOut anymore.
Simply a terrible misuse of the name, and then they misspelled the name, Flat""O""ut, with a capital O instead of a lowercase... Horrible...
Below is a pro/con list, and even further down I'll go into detail about each point.

As a FlatOut fan since the first game, I almost fell off my chair when I started this game... Okay, it wasn't so bad in the menu, but when the race started... I was horrified...
You could play a version of Hot Wheels on any handheld (Nintendo DSLite has a game like that)...

Pro/Con List:
You should always start with [u] Constructive Criticism [/u]:

- The graphics options directly show what changes.

Unfortunately, I don't have any more...

[u] Destructive Criticism: [/u]

- Graphics are beyond cheesy.
- Graphics are beyond bad.
- No soundtrack in races.
- Sounds aren't very high quality.
- Bad. Controls

Details on the individual points:
Pro:
- The graphics options immediately show what changes.
Well, I like it.
I also have a computer that can afford it. On older PCs, you can sometimes sweat in the menu, but otherwise, I like it.

Con:
- Graphics are cheesy.
If you compare FlatOut 2 with FlatOut 3, you can see that the graphics in FlatOut 2 are more natural, and in FlatOut 3, they're at the level of a child's game... simply pathetic.

- Graphics are bad.
Well, I started playing right away on the highest settings and I have to say... Half-Life 2 is from 2004 and has better graphics... I don't know, I couldn't see much because of the bright colors, but the ""dummies"" that can crash out of the cars are extremely angular and have poor edges.

- No soundtrack in races.
Maybe there is one, but I didn't notice it... In the first two games, the soundtrack stood out because it was It was very good rock music, and in this installment of the series... well, I didn't notice anything.

- No high-quality sounds
When I started my first event, I immediately noticed this annoying, strange humming noise. After careful consideration and back and forth, I came to the conclusion that it was supposed to imitate an engine noise... I'll cite Half-Life 2 from 2004 again and say it again: This game is worse than a game that came out seven years earlier.

- Bad controls
Well... whether it's bad or not is up to each individual... Since I like to compare, I'll cite FlatOut 2, where the cars would even skid out at the rear when the steering was too harsh, and I have to say: If there were a car with this level of grip, it would be a dream for every racer. You steer left and you drive left... quite simply, without any objections, your car does exactly what you tell it to do; it sticks to the left...

Since this review is very much in line with my own opinion, and I've packaged it a bit nicely, here it is again, without mincing words and in full:

[spoiler] Worst racing game I've ever ""played,"" if you can even call it playing, given the 5-minute driving time...
I almost fell over backward when I saw those childish graphics and was immediately reminded of a Hot Wheels game from the Nintendo DS Lite I used to play... Then the controls... It was just too easy. The game lost all its appeal because of those vehicles that stick to the ground. Yes, the sound... also DS Lite quality. And I can't believe this game is from 2011 because it's simply poor quality...

0.1 / 10","What can I say about Flatout 3? It's a disgrace to the series, a bummer, a bummer, a disappointment. And all because it was made by completely different people.

Some developers decided to make a buck off a well-known series, but one only has to look at the games they've created, let alone the reviews, and everything falls into place. With people like that, Flatout 3 simply couldn't have been any good. It's a complete travesty: terrible graphics, disgusting physics, and so much more. When I first launched it, I felt like soap was in my eyes! God, the graphics were so disgusting.

I bought the entire Flatout pack a long time ago, and all the games in the series cost as much as this piece of crap. So I recommend doing the same during the sale. This game should definitely not be called Flatout 3.

Overall, I don't recommend buying it. Maybe as a pack on sale or for a collection, or if you're a masochist...)

Avoid this game and here is why:
The graphics are at best mediocre.  However, despite this expect to find the game stuttering and struggling to keep up (especially when turning corners).  This quickly becomes more than a minor annoyance when you find yourself losing control because the game has stuttered on a corner.  Textures applied to the walls around the track (such as graffiti on the concrete) will flicker.  (Keep in mind this is on a PC with an i7 CPU, 8GB of RAM, and a GeForce GTX 670).

The car handling is distinctly fishy.  Half the cars will stick to the road like glue.  The other half will be sliding all over the place.  There is nothing in between. 

The AI is even fishier.  When they go around corners expect to see carnage as they drive straight in to walls.  To make up for this the AI will quickly catch you on the straights – passing your car with no problems even when you’re burning nitro.  

The damage modelling on the cars is all or nothing.  Where Flatout Ultimate Carnage slowly added damage to the cars depending on the impacts in this game your car is either brand new or has been completely crumpled.  There is no damage in between these two options.  As soon as your car scrapes against anything expect to see the whole car appear as if it has been squashed by an 18 Wheeler.","I picked this up in a multi-pack with several other games as I had played previous games in the series before.

Ecco Flatout3 non è nulla di questo. L'antico splendore della fisica, la giocabilità ed il realismo della sua prima incarnazione sono finiti a concimare il terreno dove sono stati sepolti.

Nel primo Flatout il succo risiedeva nell'accurata simulazione delle movenze dell'auto, dell'allora giovane motore grafico Havok: La compressione delle sospensioni, lo sbandare del posteriore sotto i cavalli del motore e l'aderenza che variava costantemente a seconda del fondo della pista e di come l'auto poggiasse a terra.
Per poi non parlare di come l'auto subisse danni accartocciandosi in modo tanto realistico da sembrare vera o di come gli oggetti in pista una volta urtati volassero comportandosi come le loro controparti reali.

Dopo un sequel, si bello, ma con gia alcune mancanze in fatto di realismo fisico, ecco che arriva Flatout3.

Sono state aggiunte una fiumana di modalità di gioco, tra cui ora la modalità Splatout dove si corre per la pista massacrando zombie a colpi di paraurti. Si puo correre su un monstertruck o su una monoposto da competizione. Peccato che mettendo in pista tutte queste nuove idee per spremere la fisica del motore grafico, ci si è dimenticati proprio di implementare quest'ultima nel gioco: l'auto si comporta praticamente come un go-kart: rigida, per farla curvare bisogna dare una dose spropositata di freno a mano per poi vederla riprendere subito l'assetto iniziale come se qualcuno spingesse il fianco per rimetterla dritta. 
Le ruote sono solo per abbellimento in quanto si vede lontano un miglio che non sono loro a dare trazione (o almeno così pare) pare più che un'invisiile forza spinga sul retro dell'auto per farla correre. Il sistema danni non rende giustizia, dopo aver urtato violentemente contro un avversario ne il vostro muso ne la sua fiancata presenteranno danni di sorta; come far schiantare due macchinine giocattolo tra di loro.

Le auto di per se hanno un design interessante, talvolta molto surreali ma discretamente disegnate. Sono davvero tante e sono distribuite in varie classi: si va da auto classiche, ad auto di tipo tuning con spoilers immensi, a delle vetture studiate per il derby, dunque supercorazzate ed imponenti, a delle monoposto simil F1 ma con le fattezze di caccia-bombardieri.

La pecca è che se prima si acquistava un'auto e la si potenziava man mano vedendola evolversi e voi con lei, imparando a controllarla e a pennellarci le curve, ora ,prima di ogni gara si sceglie una vettura tra l'elenco di quelle disponibili e sbloccabili via via vincendo gare, l'unico tipo di potenziamento che si puo attuare è la pseudo-selezione dell' assetto (di solito sono disponibile 2 o tre modalità) attravesto un click, dove il gioco stesso descrive in poche righe con frasi accattivanti le migliorie che si sono istallate;

Nella realtà dei fatti non si avverte nessun cambiamento, l'auto resta rigida, non curva e sembra un blocco di acciaio inox con delle rotelle.

Tutte e dico tutte le auto si comportano allo stesso modo (fatta eccezione forse per i monstertruck) l'unica differenza tra le varie classi è la velocità che raggiungono (forse).

Non esiste un campionato, tutto si è condensato in una modalità arcade dove le vittorie sbloccano auto e tracciati in modo casuale, non c'è quel clima di competizione che si aveva prima, la IA cede il passo al giocatore che si avvicina tentando il sorpasso, senza contare che spesso vedrete i vostri avversari lanciarsi deliberatamente fuori pista e speronarsi in continuazione dimenticandosi totalmente della gara. 
Esplosioni e fiamme ovunque, spettacolari ma molto di distrazione ed eccessive.
Inoltre è stato implementato una specie di superpotere che consiste in una barra rossa che si carica usando il nitro. Una volta attivato garantisce una manciata di secondi di invincibilità e la capacità di distruggere chiunque venga a contatto con la vostra auto (lo avevo gia visto fare in super mario land), il tutto in slow motion rendendo la guida ancora piu complicata.

Il motore grafico è pesantissimo ed il dettaglio che offre non rende giustizia alla tecnologia che implementa. inoltre la configurabilità della grafica è scarna, il gioco rileva le caratteristiche hardware in base al voto dell'indice prestazioni di windows
, universalmente noto per essere un'enorme bufala (un portatile samsung con 6gb di ram un core i5 da 2.4Ghz ed un'Nvidia GeForce GT540 e quasi un Tb di disco rigito si è beccato un pietoso 4.9) ma il gioco non mente: le impostazioni sopportabili sono medio-basse, anche se con questo pc gioco a titoli abbastanza recenti con un ottimo dettaglio grafico.

In fin della fiera se avete giocato il primo Flatout, reinstallatelo, rigiocatelo e spendete 30 euro in qualcos'altro. 
Se non lo avete giocato, acquistatelo e fate cio che ho consigliato prima.

Questo titolo deluderà a mio parere tutti i seguaci della serie che si aspettavano molto di piu da questo sequel.","There are sequels to games that proudly carry on the spirit of their predecessors, breathing fresh air into gameplay that has long since passed...

Flatout 3 is none of that. The former glory of the physics, gameplay, and realism of its first incarnation have ended up fertilizing the soil where they were buried.

The essence of the first Flatout lay in the accurate simulation of the car's movements, powered by the then-young Havok graphics engine: the compression of the suspension, the rear end skidding under the horsepower of the engine, and the grip that constantly varied depending on the track surface and how the car rested on the ground.
Not to mention how the car took damage, crumpling so realistically that it seemed real, or how objects on the track, once hit, flew, behaving like their real counterparts.

After a sequel that was good, but already lacking in physical realism, here comes Flatout 3.

A slew of game modes have been added, including Splatout mode, where you race around the track, slaughtering zombies with bumpers. You can race in a monster truck or a single-seater racing car. It's a shame that, while introducing all these new ideas to push the graphics engine's physics to the track, they completely forgot to implement the latter into the game: the car behaves practically like a go-kart: rigid, and to make it turn you have to apply an inordinate amount of handbrake, only to see it immediately return to its initial position, as if someone were pushing on its side to straighten it out.
The wheels are just for show, as it's obvious from a mile away that they're not providing traction (or so it seems); it's more like an invisible force pushing on the rear of the car to make it race. The damage system doesn't do it justice; after violently crashing into an opponent, neither your nose nor its side will show any damage; How to crash two toy cars into each other.

The cars themselves have interesting designs, sometimes very surreal but well-crafted. There are so many of them, and they're distributed across various classes: from classic cars to tuned cars with huge spoilers, to heavily armored and imposing derby-style cars, to F1-style single-seaters with the look of fighter-bombers.

The downside is that while you used to buy a car and gradually upgrade it, watching it evolve and you along with it, learning to control it and carve the curves, now, before each race, you choose a car from the list of available ones and unlock them gradually by winning races. The only type of upgrade you can perform is the pseudo-setup selection (usually two or three modes are available) via a single click, where the game itself describes the installed upgrades in a few lines with catchy phrases;

In reality, you don't notice any change; the car remains rigid, doesn't curve, and feels like a block of stainless steel on wheels.

All, and I mean all, the cars behave the same (except perhaps the monster trucks); the only difference between the various classes is their speed (perhaps).

There's no championship; everything has been condensed into an arcade mode where victories unlock cars and tracks randomly. There's no competitive atmosphere like before; the AI ​​gives way to the player who approaches you and attempts to overtake. Not to mention that you'll often see your opponents deliberately diving off the track and continually ramming each other, completely forgetting about the race.
Explosions and flames everywhere, spectacular but very distracting and excessive.
Additionally, a kind of superpower has been implemented consisting of a red bar that charges using nitro. Once activated, it grants a handful of seconds of invincibility and the ability to destroy anyone who comes into contact with your car (I'd already seen it done in Super Mario Land), all in slow motion, making driving even more difficult.

The graphics engine is incredibly demanding, and the detail it offers doesn't do justice to the technology it implements. Furthermore, the graphics configurability is poor; the game detects hardware specifications based on the Windows Performance Index score,
which is universally known to be a huge hoax (a Samsung laptop with 6GB of RAM, a 2.4GHz Core i5, an NVIDIA GeForce GT540, and almost a TB of hard drive got a pitiful 4.9). But the game doesn't lie: the tolerable settings are medium-low, even though I play fairly recent titles with excellent graphics settings on this PC.

At the end of the day, if you played the first Flatout, reinstall it, replay it, and spend 30 euros on something else.
If you haven't played it, buy it and do what I recommended above.

This title will, in my opinion, disappoint all fans of the series who expected much more from this sequel."

EDIT 09.05.2021:
Gra bardzo często ma przecenę i można ją kupić za przysłowiowego dolara. Całe szczęście istnieje teraz system zwrotów na steam, więc spokojnie grę można zwrócić. Kiedy ja grałem w ten syf, to takiej możliwości jeszcze nie było. Jeśli zakupisz tego crapa na przecenie, to czym prędzej go odpalaj, abyś miał szansę oddać to coś. Pamiętaj, masz dwa tygodnie, aby odzyskać kasę. Gra niewarta jest nawet złotówki.

Prawdziwi twórcy oryginalnych flatoutów to firma Bugbear Entertainment, a ich najnowsza gra podobna klimatem do flatouta to Wreckfest. Jeśli lubisz tego rodzaju wyścigi, to skieruj swoje oczy właśnie w tę stronę.

The game is often on sale and can be purchased for the proverbial dollar. Luckily, there's now a refund system on Steam, so you can easily return the game. When I played this piece of crap, that wasn't an option. If you buy this crap on sale, fire it up as soon as possible so you have a chance to return it. Remember, you have two weeks to get your money back. The game isn't worth a penny.

The true creators of the original flatout games are Bugbear Entertainment, and their latest game, which has a flatout-like feel, is Wreckfest. If you enjoy this type of racing, you should definitely check it out. Here's a direct link to the Wreckfest store: [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/228380/Wreckfest/]WRECKFEST[/url]

Se voce curtiu a serie flatout, pule esse jogo pois ele é a ""ovelha negra"" da serie","A terrible game. Despite being called Flatout, it wasn't produced by Bug Bear, but by an obscure company called Team 6. The game is a step backward from its predecessors in several aspects. The physics are poor; the cars just get dented, and you get the impression they're made of plastic, as the dents mysteriously disappear. The soundtrack has regressed and is now composed of repetitive electronic music that seems to have been made in MIDI. As for the controls, I use an Xbox 360 controller, and the cars in this game felt like they had no tires due to the difficulty of keeping them on the track. Even after enabling analog support in the game menu, the game still responded as if I were using the directional pad.

If you enjoyed the Flatout series, skip this game because it's the ""black sheep"" of the series."

Поэтому начав пользоваться Steam я решился таки на покупку следующей части, возлагая на нее большие надежды. И вот что получилось:
Заходя в меню первым делом бросается в глаза графика, несоответствующая своему времени, и не продуманное строение самого меню. Терпимо, но ожидалось что-то большее. Самое же веселое начинается при запуске первой гонки. А именно - глупо реализованная городская трасса, убогое управление и неиграбельная физика. Ориентироваться когда и куда поворачивать жутко тяжело. Машина ни капли не слушается управления, отказывается притормаживать и входить в повороты. Физика объектов и машин осталась все той же. Но если в прошлых частях это было нормально и быстро к этому прывыкал, то здесь.. 
В итоге я даже играть не стал. Просто выключил это ""творение"", обозвал ласковым словом разработчиков за неоправданные надежды и зря потраченные деньги и пошел играть во что-нибудь другое.
Не рекомендую к покупке ни в коем случае. Думаю, фанаты прошлых частей меня поймут","A few years ago, Flatout 2 was released—a game that has long been etched in my memory as an alternative take on the Burnout series, with gameplay that's much more dynamic but less realistic. So, when I started using Steam, I finally decided to buy the next installment, with high hopes. And here's what happened:
When I opened the menu, the first thing I noticed was the graphics, which were out of date for their time, and the poorly designed menu itself. It was passable, but I expected something more. The real fun begins when I started the first race. Specifically, the city track is poorly implemented, the controls are poor, and the physics are unplayable. It's incredibly difficult to know when and where to turn. The car doesn't respond to the controls at all, refusing to slow down or take turns. The physics of objects and cars remained the same. But while this was fine in previous games and I quickly got used to it, here...
In the end, I didn't even bother playing. I simply turned off this ""creation,"" called the developers names for unfulfilled expectations and wasted money, and went to play something else.
I don't recommend buying it under any circumstances. I think fans of the previous games will understand."

Sure, FlatOut is a ""game about broken cars."" But that's not what players wanted!

Also, while not really related to the main game,
the soundtrack probably only supports .mp3 files.
If you have .flac files in My Music, it will definitely crash during play!

俺のイメージしていた""Flatoutらしさ""、それが一切感じられない。ふたを開けると小さくまとまったアーケード挙動の良くある安いレゲー。これはFlatoutではない。
そもそもレゲーとしての面白さの要素が何かしら欠けている。車種・モードの多さで開発は肉を盛ったつもりだろうが、ハリボテに過ぎない。また車もFlatoutらしさがない。
グラフィック面はどうか。残念にも褒められる点はあまりない。推奨環境でVGAが旧世代フラグシップだったりするが、このグラフィックでそこまで高いリソースが必要かと疑問を抱く。
AIも雑。NFSやFUELのような謎ブーストは当たり前。壁オナニーなんてしてないでコース完走くらいはしてほしいものだ。

総合的にのっぺりしてて薄い。Team6Studiosは何を作りたかったのか。","Metascore 23 is no joke; its content is so unrewarding that it's almost painful, even trying to finish every race in the top three or complete it becomes a hassle.

It doesn't have the ""Flatout-ness"" I imagined it would have. When you play it, it's just your typical cheap retro game with compact arcade-like behavior. This is not Flatout.

To begin with, it's missing some of the elements that make a retro game fun. The developers probably thought they'd beefed it up with the number of cars and modes, but it's nothing more than a sham. The cars also don't have the Flatout feel.

And what about the graphics? Unfortunately, there's not much to praise. The recommended environment is VGA, which is the flagship of the previous generation, but I wonder if such high resources are really necessary for graphics like this.

The AI ​​is also sloppy. Mysterious boosts like NFS and FUEL are commonplace. I wish the game would at least complete the course instead of masturbating against the wall.

Overall, it's flat and shallow. What was Team6 Studios trying to create?"

Sometimes, the slightest collision with an invisible obstacle on a smooth road sends your car flying,
as if it weighs 12 kilograms and is made of paper.
The collision physics are like they were written by a drunk student on a dare.

💥 The bots are like clowns on the track.
Their logic? There is none.
Sometimes they fly straight at you, and sometimes they fly into the sky.
As if their goal was to remind you
that [i]you wasted your money.[/i]

🎨 Visual style?
The word ""style"" is an insult here.
The menu is straight from hell.
The effects are like screams of pain.
The user interface is unintuitive and awkward.
It's as if everything was thrown together hastily in a week,
and then dropped on the floor and simply put back together without looking at everything.

[b]This isn't FlatOut.[/b]
This isn't an arcade game.
This is [b]an insult to the memory of the series.[/b]
This is a museum of mistakes.
Every pixel of this game is the embodiment of indifference and contempt.

[b]✔️ Suitable if:[/b]
• You collect the worst games of all time
• Looking for material for a ""what's wrong with this nightmare"" video

[b]✖️ Not suitable if:[/b]
• You're human
• You respect your time
• You wanted to play a normal racing game

[b]💭 Bottom Line:[/b]
[b][i]FlatOut 3 is a piece of crap at 200 km/h.[/i][/b]
It's painful to watch. It's impossible to play.

late PS1 early PS2 quality, with way too much motion blur and bloom that can cause siezures there
should be a warning to those that have epilepsy; the courses themselves are unimaginative and
poorly put together. The cars look and feel like rejects from a Hot Wheels game along with some that 
were foisted from the previous FlatOut titles to give some impression that this is a sequel.

There is no structure to the gameplay mechanics, for starters the damage calculations are randomly
generated so hitting an opponent can result in either doing little to no damage to you or taking most of
your health away. There are no boundries on the tracks so you pretty much can drive where you want
with no penalties. There is no way to regain boost except crossing checkpoints; hitting cars or objects does nothing here. If they want you to use boost to ""heal"" your car then they should have more ways to obtain it.

The tracks seem to be made to fully expliot the nonexistant handling and for most of time you are riding the handbrake to get around the corners. There are tuning options for your car but they make no difference here.

The AI is the worst seen in any racing game; from the start they just smash into each other and into objects for no reason. In derby mode they all pile up on you and in no time your car is running on a sliver of health while your oppenents have most of theirs. 

The game modes themselves are poor attempts at variety, speed mode is depressingly easy to win on account of the absymal AI. Offroad is the only mode that elevates this game to very bland. Nightshift is almost impossible to win because of the deplorable handling. Stunt is probably the worst
here in that the requirements to win are so arbitrarily steep and each stunt course can only be figured out through trial and error( there is no tutorials here like in the previous titles) as well as being poorly put together that when you do win it you have no incentive to do it again.

FlatOut 3 is not beautiful, its AI is the worst I've ever seen in a racing game... They completely torn Ultimate Carnage out and excluded every single good part of it and even making it worse after that.

If someday it costs 10 bucks, don't buy it. If it's five bucks, don't buy it too. Don't even download a pirate copy of it 'cos it won't worth your time. In fact, use the same strategy which you'd use with Duke Nukem Forever: do not have it in your wishlist and say it in every social network that you will refuse this game as a gift as well.","Don't buy it.
