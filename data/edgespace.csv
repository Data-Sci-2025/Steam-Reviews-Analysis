I don't think the game was ever actually *finished.* I remember always just feeling perpetually confused in the EA (when it was actually worked on), never being entirely sure *what* to do.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.","I am 32 years old.

Now let's say this metaphorical 'person' is the anthropomorphic representation of the company Handyman Studios. At the time of their unfortunate 'toilet escapade' they were throwing an open-house party for a brand new game that they had started making. 

During the party several of the guests after having a chance to play Handyman's game commented, ""Where's the rest of the content? Why are there so many bugs?"" Mr Handyman became quickly disillusioned and distraught because no one thought it was a good game since it wasn't finished and had all sorts of bugs and, for all intents and purposes, appeared to be an almost direct copy mechanically as another very popular game called Starbound.

The Developers ""Company"" has shut down, their website/forums are down, and none of them will respond to any E-Mails/Social Media inquiries about the game. They have taken the money and left, with no intention of finishing this game.

So...here's some background:

The game had a history of being buggy and unstable, with long-standing and well-known glitches not being fixed. The combat was awkward, the balancing was poor, and there was a LOT of unfinished content. But despite this, since it was ""Early Access"" and a lot of people liked the concept of the game, we gave the devs a chance.

But before any of this was fixed, the devs started talking about ""Full release time"" approaching. A lot of us were absolutely puzzled by how they could be looking that far ahead with so many serious, game-breaking bugs still being ignored and only a tiny fraction of the promised content being done. The devs had mentioned that they had somewhere around ""10% of the total content"" in the game! Were they deciding to ignore everything wrong with the game and push it out unfinished?

In September, that was exactly what happened. The developers decided to slap the game with a fancy ""Version 1.0"" label on this, despite it not being anywhere close to finished, to get it out of Early Access so it'd be featured on the Steam Store Page and net them some easy holiday-season sales.

They added a bunch of unfinished, even more buggy content for about 3 months after release to ensure that the game kept popping up on the main page as ""Just Updated!"" during the holiday sales season. Most of these updates were just them unsuccessfully trying to fix things that had been broken since the Alpha Versions or tossing in half-finished buggy content.

In December, they claimed to be ""Going on break for the holidays"" and weren't heard from again until April. We would later be told by LadyAijou, the Community Manager, that she had departed from their project in January. By all appearances, it seems like no more work was being done on the game at this time, as Bug Reports failed to send properly, E-mails to the devs wouldn't get responses, and there was no interaction on the Forums or Twitter.

Their last post on Steam was in April, coincidentally right before they put their game into the Humble Indie Bundle in May to squeeze any last possible amount of revenue out. The post was a pretty blatant attempt to make potential Bundle buyers who look on the News Page for the game think it was still being actively developed and supported. By then, their Community Manager was no longer working with them, and one of their devs posted a ""We'll have information for you soon!"" message from his private steam profile. They haven't been heard from since.

To be frank, this is looking like a classic Early Access scam, with the developer drastically overpromising, then running with as much money as possible and leaving the game uncompleted.

Normally, I would just shake my head and move on, but this one really offended me. They had obviously realized very early that they wouldn't be able to finish their game. But instead of telling their customers, they calculated exactly how to milk the most sales out of their unfinished mess. They got their ""Full Release"" up just before the Holiday Season, and kept putting out very minor patches every week or so not to fix the game, but to ensure that the game would keep popping up in the Steam Store's front page as ""Recently Updated"" to maximize sales during the holiday season.

No updates after that and only a vague ""Please be patient"" message from a private steam profile 3 months later, right before a Humble Bundle sale.

This is the kinda crap people need to spread the word about. Stuff like Edge of Space and Towns are scams that people are not only getting away with, but making a lot of money on. Let people know what happened here. Let people looking at this game know to not waste their money and to be very, VERY discerning when looking at future early-access titles.

TLDR: I enjoyed this more than singleplayer terraria. Even ignoring for a while then replaying, I've enjoyed this more than terraria. It's more combat exploration with rewarding progress than terraria's building + useless non-progress and giant skips.

If you play single player (I would like to try multiplayer, but my friends have consuls...)
Love/hated terraria or are tired of the same feeling games 
and want something fresh
and wanted more space shooter than mining... (sorta)
want the game to reward you rather than penalize you for not doing the only 1 thing that you are caged into
Then this is for you.

Does it eventually fall flat? yes... But so do 'finished' games that lack real story or just end poorly
So if you are ok with an experience that is fun for a while then ends, great! You have a game that feels like more a shooter that rewards whatever you feel like doing vs say terraria..
EG terraria has very uneven scaaling that reward skipping massive tiers and jumping straight to a higher tier, which means all the other stuff is meaningless. EG wasted materials with absolutely no value! Activities are wasted time in terraria. Jump strait to jumgle, then find worthless items until you mind like crazy (for no reward) to get low enough to find the occasional rare reward worth having. is that a good experience?
HHow about instead: 
This game uses 'low tier' items continuously and gives exp for any activity you feel like doing. Killing stuff? Yes = exp. Mining? Yes = exp. Short mission? yes = exp and bonus materials to soffen the ""find enough iron"" effect. Rare Items? Yes = feel worth it.
Does it encourage pushing yourself? yes = higher level or deeper = more exp and better items, so go ahead and risk pushing deeper and levelling faster (but you will need to risk lighter gear to do that).

Story? not really. Did terarria? I shure didn't find one there. So how about you just have fun space blasting and getting stronger and facing meaner stuff. 

Other notable games: planet centuri, signs of life, terraria, starbound, darkout, windforge! All have a different feeling but are similar ish. I loved signs of life's fast mining. Windforge felt weird... until I started jumping over attacks and sky raiding and chomping entire islands with a grinder ship! All are fun, but Edge of Space offers the most space shooter focus. I have no idea why it was abandoned/not popular enough. Similar games have survived far worse issues (eg signs of life has continued past several early issues and continues to receive updates to it's credit)

This is very comparable to Darkout:  it'is abandoned as well but also worth your looking at. It stands as one of the most visually beautiful but runs into a story hard stop. enjoy it for the little gem while it lasts. Edge of space focused on combat and fast exploration (in comparison, terraria pushes lack of skill + proper equipment to force finding exceptionally rare items/mining, which feels like a grind)

Well, ok, let's start with this: I came expecting some kind of Terraria-like game with a space element, but got a trashy, very limited and extremely clunky controls instead. Gameplay is bad because of that very reason, your caracter seems stiff and every action looks and feels very bad. Battles are trashy, and I couldn't bring myself to play enough to face any bosses, but I'm expecting them to be as bad as your regular enemy in this game. This really feels like a Terraria-gone-bad thing, if you want a good Terraria-like game in space, try out Starbound.

First glaring issue is the game is built in Unity3D but does NOT provide options to play in full screen.  Read the other reviews and you will find lots of people complaining about this, as it does make it unplayable for most people.  You can work around this issue by also buying Borderless Gaming app from Steam.

Secondly, the title screen simply looks horrid.  The planet on that screen is clearly a copy-paste from another image, and i have to say it was not cleaned around the edges properly.

Third, many menus and UI elements show signs of amateur development.  Many UI elements react by clicking on the text, not the button or tab.  Some UI elements do accept clicks on the tab, but do not see the click if your mouse is on the text.  As an experienced Unity dev, I can attest these are amazingly simple issues that can be resolved in just a few seconds each.

All in all, the development issues I see are all simple to fix.  I dare say they could all easily be fixed in just one day’s work.  The sheer fact that they persist in the game more than five years after its release, says a lot about the developers themselves.

Мені самому було цікаво, як вона опинилася у мене. Виявляється, я її придбав ще у 2016-му, коли ""Край космосу"" був у ранньому доступі, у 2017-му розробник не дотримався своїх обіцянок і полишив гру, а я нарешті знайшов на неї час у 2020-му.

Незважаючи на те, що гра має лише 35%-ий рейтинг, вона здалася мені такою, на яку можна витратити декілька годин свого часу. І я не помилився. Це певний клон Терарії у космосі, але через незавершеність тут набагато менше контенту. Хоча мені це навіть сподобалося, бо гра не має того нагромадження косметичного сміття, яке є у Терарії, система створення предметів спрощена та більш структурована. Також у грі менше ресурсів, найважливіші створюються самим гравцем з основних, а система знань, яка обмежує кількість предметів для створення тільки допомагає виокремити важливі речі у певні етапи гри. Завдяки цьому я досить швидко звикнув до крафту і міг спокійно досліджувати планету. Сама планета сповнена створіннями, складається з 3 біомів(хоча розробник обіцяв більше), які різняться ресурсами й істотами. Є декілька видів зброї, броні, покращень, компаньйонів, майже 2 десятки неігрових персонажів, які дають свої завдання. Босів я не знайшов, як і сюжет(є ціль досліджувати планету, про що наголошується у діалогах, проте не зрозуміло, як бути героєві: чи йому варто будувати космічний корабель, чи буде можливість побудови колонії).

Графіка досить непогана, монстри чудернацькі, загалом все як у Терарії, лише всі істоти разом з героєм не знаходяться в одній площині з навколишнім світом, а наче накладені на зображення (на скріншотах це трохи помітно, а в русі це видно). Непогане озвучення, яке разом зі стилістикою гри створюють свою атмосферу.

Відсутня українська локалізація.

Висновок: купувати звісно не раджу, бо розробник ошукав людей, які підтримували гру з самого початку й значно переплатили. Гра має значний потенціал, який, на жаль, втрачено.",

TL;DR - Fun for a few hours, but repetitive. The game is abandoned in its unfinished state.
 
[I]Edge of Space[/I], henceforth as EoS, had a lot of promise going in and is akin to games such as [I]Terraria[/I], [I]Starbound[/I], or [I]Minecraft[/I]. In fact, there is crossover content from [I]Terraria[/I] within EoS. The base premise is the same as those other games -- the player explore (and fight) through various biomes gathering resources to build new items and structures. In that respect, the game does an excellent job of letting the player explore their respective sandbox right out the gate. Unfortunately, at the same time the game plops the player down right into the sandbox without any sense of direction.

Regardless, the game is quite fun... at first. The character you control heads out exploring this new world he or she finds themselves in, encounters various flora and fauna (not all of which are hostile in this upper biome), discovers new resources, and acquires knowledge which in turn unlocks new craftable items. Thus, the first few hours is actually quite interesting and enjoyable. However, even at this point, the player may encounter ""hiccups"" in what's happening in the game. And it soon becomes apparent that this game feels unfinished, because it is.

There are three major biomes in the game -- protolife, comet, and barren. Think of them as layers on a cake, if you will, with an upper, middle, and lower layers, respectively. Each have unique creatures to that layer and can contain mini-biomes such as ice and crystal caves or nesting sites for a certain type of creature. The protolife if filled with numerous flora and docile creatures, while the comet biome is an arctic tundra with more dangerous creatures the deeper you go, and finally the desert-like barrens biome with even deadlier hostiles. Nonetheless, each biome doesn't necessary feel any different than the one preceding it. That's because there's very little non-cosmetic changes between the layers. A few creatures and resource types are added or exchanged, and that's quite literally it. Leading the game towards a direction of sameness and repetition overall.

The game is further marred on its craftable side as well. The list of craftable items is great and expansive. Sadly, the player will not likely craft most of the items from this list. That's because the materials to craft certain items are virtually unacquirable or by the time one does obtain an ample supply those items are no longer relevant. The rest of the craftables are either cosmetic in nature, not viable in your game, or flatout useless. Worst still is that apparently some items will break your game or its save via corrupting either your character or the world it used to populate. I found myself crafting the same few items over and over again which were [U]Plasma Torches[/U] (as a permanent light source), [U]Walls[/U] (for walls, obviously, and for base-building, defense, and the creation of platforms while exploring), [U]Earthen Door[/U] (to get in and out of your many bases), and [U]Command Nodes[/U] (to teleport between other nodes and command centers). Anything else was generally not worth it (i.e., weapons systems requiring ammunition which can potentially break your game, or the convoluted and unnecessary power management system). 

As I've hinted at, EoS had the potential to be something great (even earning awards during development), and I wondered why it failed to achieve it. Upon further research, I've discovered that EoS is extensively gutted, with many things gone unimplemented, and is a sad shell of what it should have been. For example, more variety of creatures and structures, something more than a superficial plot and the inclusion of questlines, and even a basic tutorial (which barely exists spiritually in the codex). From the old data (here on Steam, Kickstarter, Google documents, and elsewhere), one can see that the developers worked tirelessly, even changing the game engine, and interacted with the community during those earlier years. Through a terrible set of circumstances, miscommunications, and unfulfilled promises they got into a vicious cycle of just surviving on other contracts and running out of money while either putting EoS on the backburner or adding a mess of things to it (and ultimately culling most of it). Doing so kept pushing EoS further and further from the finish line. Apparently, the developers salvaged what they could, removed many of the game's systems, and released the hallowed shell that EoS is today before abandoning the project altogether. That's right. The state of the game with all its flaws, bugs, and technical issues will forever be the final version. At least it's playable for the most part. In the developer's own words, truncated (from the Google Documents link sourced here [url]https://steamcommunity.com/gid/103582791434400882/announcements/detail/1685922756609775177[/url]):
[I]It's not making enough for us to focus on it. The technological barrier is huge and makes it impractical to work on. Engine related bugs [will] never be fixed. The honest end answer is we don't have the capacity to go back and update EoS. Nor would it be technologically viable to do.[/I]

So why did I put in as many hours (~91) as I did at the time of this review given all that I have said? Well, I didn't know anything about EoS when I first started, and I wanted to put in a good faith effort into the game to see if my mid-initial impressions would change. Additionally, my perseverance (and perhaps a bit of anger) to reach the third major biome and mess around in there for a while once I had reached it fueled me more than I care to admit. My time would have been better served elsewhere. Nevertheless, I may revisit this game from time-to-time to incrementally expand a few bases and network the megabases together for the sheer absurdity of it all.

This game was gifted by a friend.","[H1]An exercise in frustration.[/H1]

TL;DR - Fun for a few hours, but repetitive. The game is abandoned in its unfinished state.
 
[I]Edge of Space[/I], henceforth as EoS, had a lot of promise going in and is akin to games such as [I]Terraria[/I], [I]Starbound[/I], or [I]Minecraft[/I]. In fact, there is crossover content from [I]Terraria[/I] within EoS. The base premise is the same as those other games -- the player explore (and fight) through various biomes gathering resources to build new items and structures. In that respect, the game does an excellent job of letting the player explore their respective sandbox right out the gate. Unfortunately, at the same time the game plops the player down right into the sandbox without any sense of direction.

Regardless, the game is quite fun... at first. The character you control heads out exploring this new world he or she finds themselves in, encounters various flora and fauna (not all of which are hostile in this upper biome), discovers new resources, and acquires knowledge which in turn unlocks new craftable items. Thus, the first few hours is actually quite interesting and enjoyable. However, even at this point, the player may encounter ""hiccups"" in what's happening in the game. And it soon becomes apparent that this game feels unfinished, because it is.

There are three major biomes in the game -- protolife, comet, and barren. Think of them as layers on a cake, if you will, with an upper, middle, and lower layers, respectively. Each have unique creatures to that layer and can contain mini-biomes such as ice and crystal caves or nesting sites for a certain type of creature. The protolife if filled with numerous flora and docile creatures, while the comet biome is an arctic tundra with more dangerous creatures the deeper you go, and finally the desert-like barrens biome with even deadlier hostiles. Nonetheless, each biome doesn't necessary feel any different than the one preceding it. That's because there's very little non-cosmetic changes between the layers. A few creatures and resource types are added or exchanged, and that's quite literally it. Leading the game towards a direction of sameness and repetition overall.

The game is further marred on its craftable side as well. The list of craftable items is great and expansive. Sadly, the player will not likely craft most of the items from this list. That's because the materials to craft certain items are virtually unacquirable or by the time one does obtain an ample supply those items are no longer relevant. The rest of the craftables are either cosmetic in nature, not viable in your game, or flatout useless. Worst still is that apparently some items will break your game or its save via corrupting either your character or the world it used to populate. I found myself crafting the same few items over and over again which were [U]Plasma Torches[/U] (as a permanent light source), [U]Walls[/U] (for walls, obviously, and for base-building, defense, and the creation of platforms while exploring), [U]Earthen Door[/U] (to get in and out of your many bases), and [U]Command Nodes[/U] (to teleport between other nodes and command centers). Anything else was generally not worth it (i.e., weapons systems requiring ammunition which can potentially break your game, or the convoluted and unnecessary power management system). 

As I've hinted at, EoS had the potential to be something great (even earning awards during development), and I wondered why it failed to achieve it. Upon further research, I've discovered that EoS is extensively gutted, with many things gone unimplemented, and is a sad shell of what it should have been. For example, more variety of creatures and structures, something more than a superficial plot and the inclusion of questlines, and even a basic tutorial (which barely exists spiritually in the codex). From the old data (here on Steam, Kickstarter, Google documents, and elsewhere), one can see that the developers worked tirelessly, even changing the game engine, and interacted with the community during those earlier years. Through a terrible set of circumstances, miscommunications, and unfulfilled promises they got into a vicious cycle of just surviving on other contracts and running out of money while either putting EoS on the backburner or adding a mess of things to it (and ultimately culling most of it). Doing so kept pushing EoS further and further from the finish line. Apparently, the developers salvaged what they could, removed many of the game's systems, and released the hallowed shell that EoS is today before abandoning the project altogether. That's right. The state of the game with all its flaws, bugs, and technical issues will forever be the final version. At least it's playable for the most part. In the developer's own words, truncated (from the Google Documents link sourced here [url]https://steamcommunity.com/gid/103582791434400882/announcements/detail/1685922756609775177[/url]):
[I]It's not making enough for us to focus on it. The technological barrier is huge and makes it impractical to work on. Engine related bugs [will] never be fixed. The honest end answer is we don't have the capacity to go back and update EoS. Nor would it be technologically viable to do.[/I]

So why did I put in as many hours (~91) as I did at the time of this review given all that I have said? Well, I didn't know anything about EoS when I first started, and I wanted to put in a good faith effort into the game to see if my mid-initial impressions would change. Additionally, my perseverance (and perhaps a bit of anger) to reach the third major biome and mess around in there for a while once I had reached it fueled me more than I care to admit. My time would have been better served elsewhere. Nevertheless, I may revisit this game from time-to-time to incrementally expand a few bases and network the megabases together for the sheer absurdity of it all.

Le jeu est brouillon. On ne comprend pas vraiment ce qu'il faut faire, et il n’y a pas grand-chose pour nous expliquer. Le décor est sympa mais le fait que la map soit éparpiller en ille flottante devient très rapidement ennuyant (pour pas être vulgaire).
Les arme armure et outil ne sont pas plaisante à déverrouiller. C’est long et en plus il y a du matériel qu’on ne trouve pas pour les fabriquer. L’excavation est un véritable calvaire tant que vous n’avais pas déverrouiller la drill qui est un outil spécialiser dans les armures « Builder » (les armures sont séparées en trois catégorie qui ont chacune leur branche de recherche, combat/explorateur/Builder).

Le système de combat et vraiment pas top et je ne parle pas des armes difficilement upgradable pour tuer des ennemies de plus haut niveau. Les ennemies qui d’ailleurs ont tendance a tiré une quantité de grenade rebondissante et de missile téléguidé outrageusement élevé.

Il y a des véhicules. Mouhai, dans ce monde ils sont très rapidement inutiles, tous particulièrement a cause du fait que l’on ne peut pas les ramassé. Il devient donc inutile dans ce monde ou il vous faut creuser ver le bas pour avancer. (À l’exception de l’excavateur qui permet de creuser mais il se fait rapidement détruire par les ennemies.)

Ajouton a sa d’autre problème lier a ce genre de jeu comme le craft qui ne prend pas en compte ce qui ce trouve dans les coffre de votre base, pas de bouton pour stocker nos matériau automatiquement, si vous nette pas SUR la table de craft le craft ne ce lance pas, ext…

Finalement pour ce qui dise qu’il ressemble à un Terraria ou un Starbound, perso je ne vois pas en quoi, hormis le coté bac à sable. Le jeu et « vide » et le décor n’est pas plaisent.

Je le déconseille donc, sauf a la limite si vous n’avais rien à jouer et qu’il est à 3 euros.

Sur ce, bon jeu.

","I strongly advise against it. It's not even worth more than 5 euros at the most.

The game is messy. We don't really understand what to do, and there's not much to explain. The scenery is nice, but the fact that the map is scattered across floating islands quickly becomes boring (not to be vulgar).
The weapons, armor, and tools are not fun to unlock. It's long, and there are materials you can't find to craft them. Excavation is a real ordeal until you unlock the drill, which is a tool specialized in ""Builder"" armor (the armor is separated into three categories, each with its own research branch: combat/explorer/Builder).

The combat system is really not great, and I'm not even talking about the weapons, which are difficult to upgrade to kill higher-level enemies. The enemies, by the way, tend to fire an outrageously high number of bouncing grenades and guided missiles.

There are vehicles. Mouhai, in this world they quickly become useless, especially because you can't pick them up. They therefore become useless in this world where you have to dig downwards to advance. (With the exception of the excavator, which allows you to dig, but it is quickly destroyed by enemies.)

Add to that other problems related to this type of game, like crafting, which doesn't take into account what's in your base's chests, no button to automatically store our materials, if you don't clean ON the crafting table, the craft doesn't start, etc.

Finally, as for those who say it resembles Terraria or Starbound, personally I don't see how, apart from the sandbox aspect. The game is ""empty"" and the setting isn't appealing.

So I don't recommend it, unless you have nothing to play and it's 3 euros.

On that note, enjoy the game.

Prepare-se como um agente da Ark Corporation, enviado para os confins do universo em busca de planetas habitáveis ​​para terraformar. No entanto, após a longa jornada espacial, você acorda do estado de crioterapia para descobrir que seu navio saiu do curso e está desativado perto de um estranho mundo novo. Sem outra alternativa senão descer à superfície e descobrir como sobreviver o tempo suficiente para completar sua missão, você entra na cápsula de escape.

Ao longo do caminho, você coletará recursos para criar armaduras, armas, instalações e veículos para ajudá-lo a explorar o mundo e conquistar seus habitantes agressivos. Sua base de operações irá evoluir de algumas instalações básicas expostas para os elementos em uma fortaleza endurecida repleta de tecnologias avançadas que permitem que você realize melhorias incríveis em seu equipamento e altere o ambiente em si.

Tenha cuidado, porém; quase tudo lá em baixo quer matar você, incluindo os ferozes tubarões a laser, os ursos polares com artilharia pesada, os pinguins jet perversamente rápidos e até os horrores mais loucos. Na borda do espaço, você deve se adaptar ou morrer. Boa sorte, ArkCo Operative!

Não perca seu tempo e seu dinheiro, volte para a loja!","About the story:

Become an agent of the Ark Corporation, sent to the far reaches of the universe in search of habitable planets to terraform. However, after a long space journey, you awaken from cryotherapy to discover your ship has veered off course and is disabled near a strange new world. With no other choice but to descend to the surface and figure out how to survive long enough to complete your mission, you board the escape pod.

Along the way, you'll collect resources to craft armor, weapons, facilities, and vehicles to help you explore the world and conquer its aggressive inhabitants. Your base of operations will evolve from a few basic facilities exposed to the elements into a hardened fortress brimming with advanced technologies that allow you to perform incredible upgrades to your equipment and alter the environment itself.

Be careful, though; almost everything down there wants to kill you, including ferocious laser sharks, polar bears with heavy artillery, wickedly fast jet penguins, and even the craziest horrors. At the edge of space, you must adapt or die. Good luck, ArkCo Operative!

I'd done a similar thing with Starbound, and although I still dislike that game, I can appreciate the effort put behind it. As the window split itself across both my monitors, and then proceeded to crash on startup, I checked the forums. Based on what I read, this game hasn't had a single significant change in all those years I left it behind.

It's saddening that I could refuse to use words like ""is"" or ""has"" in favor of ""was"" or ""had"" and any review I could create would be largely unchanged. As for what this game is actually like, here's what I have to say.

If you get the game running, you'll find yourself bombarded with text once you load in. Once you actually get moving, you'll realize that the design of the world is based on broken islands that are easy to fall off of. You'll also notice that the controls of the game are janky at best. Moving feels both slippery and sluggish, hotbar selects items in the wrong direction (although this may just be a matter of preference), enemies just feel... wrong to fight, etc. The game is broken in the way only early access games can be. It's incomplete, has no endgame content at all, and is built from systems that don't function well together.

Being young, with nothing else new to play, I powered through it all for 54 hours. One day, I turned it off, and decided to never play it again. While I don't remember that day, I finally know why I did it.

Coming back to this game has made me think of early access games as grains of sand blown by desert winds. Some grains catch the winds of development and get to soar, ending up unfathomable distances from where they started.
Other games, like Edge of Space, are tossed into the air, only to fall into the ocean, and never feel the wind again.

- The tutorial is virtually nonexistent and there's little guidance regarding controls or objectives.

- The only gating on new recipes is what resources you've managed to find (with no guidance as to what the resources might look like or where to find them). Recipes themselves are unlocked with XP, which you get from pretty anything, including just mining dirt.
- You start on top of one of a number of small floating landmasses and have to drop down further for more advanced resources, so you either stay up top running the risk of dying in a fall and with nothing but dirt, mud, and clay, or you drop down and have trouble finding your way back to your cryopod. There's no logical reason to start on tiny floating islands, or to even have them in the first place.
- You can't build or mine in some areas until you ""dominate"" them which seems to always be by destroying four mob-spawners. Sometimes these mob-spawners are behind unpowered doors and the game offers no tips on how to open the doors. You can't remove them (because you haven't ""dominated"" the area and therefore can't mine), and Googling has been unhelpful.

Starbound is polished, has ongoing support, offers an actual narrative, a less-cluttered and more intuitive interface (as well as a greater aesthetic charm).

As a long-time player of Terraria, and a would-be starbound player, I can say that the negativity surrounding this game is complete and utter ignorance.

I love this game.

Yes, I was hooked by the 'Terraria-Esque' nature of the game. It's got the same heart, after all. It's a 2D sandbox with mining and fighting. But, the game provided such a new, fresh approach to that core that saying it's a worse version of Terraria is comparing apples to oranges.

Now, I can understand why people hate on this game. The start of it is so rough, so confusing, so rigid, that it doesn't really pull you in like other games might. I bought this game a long time ago, and, while I mostly blame the massive lag my previous computer had from repelling me, I was very uninterested in the game at the time of first playing.

However, I don't know why, but just recently, I came back. In the span of less than a week, I've logged 28.5 hours into this game. 

And I don't regret a single minute of it.

I'm hooked!

I haven't felt this excited to be home and play a game since I played heavily modded Terraria with friends. It's something that really makes me excited to have some spare time in my life, which is an experience I don't find with nearly any other game.

It took some time to really understand the mechanics of this game because, after all, it isn't just a fancy space version of Terraria like everyone wants it to be. It's so different. Which brings me back to why I love this game. Why it's so different from Terraria.

Exploration.

I find that Terraria's exploration system comes to be a bit lack-luster, especially after several playthroughs, normal, expert, hardcore, modded, and modded expert. It always feels grindy, boring, and, with enough dying, extremely frustrating.

But this game let me love the one thing I always wanted. Exploration. It's what this game is all about, in my opinion. Sure, there's monsters, mobs, bosses, grinding, building, mining, all of that. Maybe it doesn't do those things as well as Terraria, but I have no issue saying it's not far behind. But, the exploration in this game? It's heavenly, it's serene, and it's simply amazing. 

The very core of this game and what makes it so enjoyable to play is the vast landscapes for you to explore. And Edge of Space's formula makes this so much better. An alien planet, quite different from yours, for you to explore and grow within. Edge of Space captures this perfectly. I've never seen this much originality in the habitats you can discover. It's so unpredictable, and you never know what to expect. It's great, it's fresh, and it's fun. 

Take a look at the Achoa biome. It's magnificent. You start your adventure in this place which seems so familiar and yet, can't be more alien. Flying jellyfish are a lurking threat, yet friendly creatures like snails and frogs are fun to hop on and take a ride to the deepest depths of the world. (Seriously, thank you for letting the player stand on these and share fall speed. It's so much fun to stand on a snail as it falls miles downward into assumably certain death.) And the implementation of docile creatures is a very fine move. It allows the player to find relative peace on their travels, or, if they wish, wreak complete havoc and devastation to the population which surrounds them. It allows for a wide range of playstyles in this game, which gives it both replayability and personalization, which is one of my favorite aspects of any game, period. 

Speaking of playstyles, I should mention the elements of RPG in this game that really give it that signature Edge of Space experience.

Personally, I'm in a love-hate relationship with this portion of the game. I'm really happy that they allow for 3 types of both armor and weapon paths, but the xp system could possibly use improvement. It's honestly a gripe, not even a complaint, but it's worth noting that the xp caps at 10,000. This isn't an issue for a good portion of the game, but reaching the later half of the game really opens up some frustration, as I find myself in a rush to spend my xp at times, which is really kinda ridiculous. This only really happens when I reach that cap unknowingly, and, wishing not to waste any xp, stop whatever I'm doing and invest it in an upgrade which may or may not be extremely important to me at the time. The main issue with this is that this happens quite frequently in the middle of large-scale battles, like when I'm being surrounded by a horde of nautiluses or artilla bears, or fighting off dungeon or nest monsters. It's not even that big of a deal, but I find it somewhat annoying personally.

With all that being said, there's really nothing in the game I have to complain about. It's not the most intuitive of games, but that gives you some real satisfaction in learning and progressing. It's just a fun game. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a unique and fresh experience in the 2D sandbox platform.

[TL:DR] Edge of Space is a brilliant game which encapsulates the wonder and curiosity of an alien planet with the dangers and hardships one may face in that environment. Disregard the negative reviews on this game and realize that this isn't Terraria. If you're looking for the exact same experience as Terraria, then go play Terraria. However, if you love exploration, space, or just 2D sandbox games, I would highly advise you to give this game a go. It has a really shaky beginning, but just give it time. I promise you it's worth it.","People hate on it because it's not Terraria or Starbound.

As a long-time player of Terraria, and a would-be starbound player, I can say that the negativity surrounding this game is complete and utter ignorance.

I love this game.

Yes, I was hooked by the 'Terraria-Esque' nature of the game. It's got the same heart, after all. It's a 2D sandbox with mining and fighting. But, the game provided such a new, fresh approach to that core that saying it's a worse version of Terraria is comparing apples to oranges.

Now, I can understand why people hate on this game. The start of it is so rough, so confusing, so rigid, that it doesn't really pull you in like other games might. I bought this game a long time ago, and, while I mostly blame the massive lag my previous computer had from repelling me, I was very uninterested in the game at the time of first playing.

However, I don't know why, but just recently, I came back. In the span of less than a week, I've logged 28.5 hours into this game. 

And I don't regret a single minute of it.

I'm hooked!

I haven't felt this excited to be home and play a game since I played heavily modded Terraria with friends. It's something that really makes me excited to have some spare time in my life, which is an experience I don't find with nearly any other game.

It took some time to really understand the mechanics of this game because, after all, it isn't just a fancy space version of Terraria like everyone wants it to be. It's so different. Which brings me back to why I love this game. Why it's so different from Terraria.

Exploration.

Now I liked Terraria and it's a really good game. But this game, I bought it as soon as I could because I wanted more of that Terraria feeling, same with Starbound. Seeing how both games were in space, which opens a door to a much bigger game; I had a lot of hopes.

I initially played it for a while, coming back every now and again to check on the new stuff. But as later on, when I booted it up again after about a few months of not playing, I noticed nothing changed, I just played for a bit and that was that. When I played it recently, it was still in the same state. I went to the reviews and forums to see all the posts about this, and how the game is abandoned.

This saddens me because it could have been great if the devs worked on it with more passion, actually trying to compete with Starbound. But from what I am seeing, Starbound completely changed how it was to how it is now; while Edge of Space is just a skeleton now, not a corpse, a skeleton. Also kind of funny seeing my friends reviews for Starbound saying how that game is bad and how Edge of Space is better.

So just remember, check the dates for the reviews to get a good timeframe of what was going on. Also, in case this wasn't clear, don't buy this. Unless the devs or someone comes along to revive this game, it will just be another Terraria-like game.

Sadly, I'm sure it's dead. I backed this on Kickstarter way back in May 2012. The original delivery day was Aug 2012, but I'm sure no one with any experience backing stuff on Kickstarter is unsurprised to learn it missed it's delivery day. That was fine, honestly. I hung out in their chatrooms, played the early builds and I feel I got my money's worth playing those builds.

But.. it was never complete. If you read the latest announcement (August 2018, as of this writing), you'll see they had to take contract work to fund EoS. They had to do some changes to the unity engine to get it to work, and etc. etc.. Still, work progressed, so I kept playing (on mostly pre-Steam pre-releases)

Then the Steam release hit.  While it added more content, I'd still regard it as fundamentally incomplete. But that's fairly common for the projects I backed, so while I went 'hmm..' I reserved judgement.  Then the devs vanished. Oh, dear.

I didn't think most of it until I read the most recent review. While I can admit it's nice to go 'We screwed up, we can't fix this..'.. it still means that only at 75%+ discounts, is this game remotly worth it. And.. at that, I still wouldn't recommend it.

If you're not happy with the way an early access game ended up then that's your problem not the developers, what you expect will never line up with what the developers aim for in any EA game. The state the game is in currently is perfectly fine for an OK game, when you buy into early access you accept that you could end up with an unfinished product for many reasons, in this case they officially released it, ""unfinished"" or not you folks not recommending but having played it for 200+ hours got your moneys worth.~

I see reviews like this attacking a less then satisfied customer base all the time. I would say it's like saying ""I don't care if that hamburger gave you food poisoning you ate it and enjoyed it at the time you should have known the risk.""
It's the how dare you be angry about this mentality that I think is a complete joke. 
The funny thing is I would almost agree with Neronix17 if the game was still in EA and this unfinished broken promise of a game was not being sold right now (at $14.99 for the standered edition no less) as done.

With all that said let me review the game.

Gameplay:  It's unfinished

If you're not happy with the way an early access game ended up then that's your problem not the developers, what you expect will never line up with what the developers aim for in any EA game. The state the game is in currently is perfectly fine for an OK game, when you buy into early access you accept that you could end up with an unfinished product for many reasons, in this case they officially released it, ""unfinished"" or not you folks not recommending but having played it for 200+ hours got your moneys worth.~

I see reviews like this attacking a less then satisfied customer base all the time. I would say it's like saying ""I don't care if that hamburger gave you food poisoning you ate it and enjoyed it at the time you should have known the risk.""
It's the how dare you be angry about this mentality that I think is a complete joke. 
The funny thing is I would almost agree with Neronix17 if the game was still in EA and this unfinished broken promise of a game was not being sold right now (at $14.99 for the standered edition no less) as done.

With all that said let me review the game.

Gameplay:  It's unfinished

I visited the forums a few times for Edge Of Space, and the complaints are in the thousands. It's bad enough when I hear of adults getting scammed, but to see how many kids lost their money for a game that had showed promise, and then the dev ran off, thats just wrong. 
As of this review, 4 new price deals are now showing. $14.99 standard edition, $24.99 Special Edition.( If there is no one writing code for this game, how on earth can special content be added? it can't! You get the same incomplete game at $14.99 or $24.99) Then there is the 4-pack for $39.99. The last one, Special Edition upgrade $11.99. Zero Times Zero = Zero. Zero + Zero = 0. 
As I said before, the games been at $4.50 for a long time. Anyone could have gotten 10 copies for $45.00. Guess the company figured no one would notice a 70% price increase for the holidays.
When I bought this title for $4.50, I already read the complaints not just in the reviews, but the forums as well. If you just want something to tinker with, I suggest waiting till the price drops back to $4.50 or less, or even one of those 90% coupons. 
This is not one of those titles where trolls are leaving negative reviews because updates are slow in coming. It's because the people who started this game, just left. Three years ago. Had you clicked the developer link before Steam had updated the game client, you would have gotten a page not found.
Seems the Publisher has no issue of taking peoples money, their link is still active. 
Anyway, if I ever get the time, I will update this with information about what game play is possible. Christmas is just around the corner. There are so Many games like this, but MUCH better. Some are early access (EA) some not. I highly recommend Spacebound, Terraria, Dig or Die, Crea, Planet Centauri, Signs Of Life, and Wayward (Small multi-player game but still fun, and cheap too!) All the games I suggested, are either completed or still getting improved but very playable and very little or no bugs at all. Every one of the suggested titles, have their own multi-server program which is either stand alone, or built into the game client to allow friends and family to join you, plus you can build and explore in every one of them. Some games have endings, some infinate, some so huge you will take ages just to scratch the content. Most have workshop mods too. Look them up, but please, don't make the mistake of paying full price for Edge Of Space and expect a full working title. Read the forums, and see for yourself. 90% complaints can't all be trolls.
As for (EA)Early Access games; dont let one like this ruin it for everyone else. Games like this that  actually made it, or came close , had difficult starts because of games like this and no one wants to pay full price for a game to get burned.

Check youtube to see if anyone posted information or game play footage. If the person is reputable, then Id say the game is worth the investment.

TLDR: This is No man's Sky. The sidescrolling version without interplanetary flying. Play Starbound and Terraria instead.

Review: Unlike terraria you do not constantly get molested by a host of vaguely chtulu or haloween themed monsters. There is a fake ecosystem of frogs and crabs and stuff that just happens to live about the planet's surface. The game hints that your goal is to exterminate all life on the surface for some reason. Occasionally I would get an event telling me to go mine out a local creature's nest. Mining also seemed to give experience on a per-tile mined basis and the game featured setting up a workbench and grinding at upgrades. I thought the visual presentation was not all that bad. The animations, color palettes and sprite quality seemed alright. The procedural generation was messed up, created my homebase on at tiny island floating in the heavens meaning to start the game I had to first dive down towards the surface. Jetpack seemed to work when it wants to, sometimes holding a charge no problem and sometimes refusing to lift me up whatsoever. Interactivity with environment felt very limited. Monsters were not outright attacking me, and the mining laser would refuse to deconstruct trees, as well as animals. The audio was extremely sparse with only a few sound effects here and there. The intro cutscene was obviously done with cost cutting measures in mind but it was done elegantly enough that I could give it a pass. Some of the terrain tiles seemed mismatched with grass tiles popping out of the surface unevenly for no reason next to regular dirt tiles for example. This game does not feel finished. It feels like it was rushed out of early access with bare minimum for core features and procedural generation to pick up the slack.","Tags: Sidescroll - Survival & Questing

Isso foi só o basico do basico do jogo, ele possui problemas como qualquer outro, como um tutorial horrivel na qual não é interativo, ele é bem dificil de se acostumar com algumas mecanicas, mas ainda sim é um baita jogo que infelizmente foi abandonado ( e jogos assim são cruciais os updates para tornalos melhor a cada update ).

Usability is a nightmare. 

Controls are not that intuitive, if. you're going to make a sandbox genre game that copies elements from successful ones - maybe also copy control schemes that are prove to work.

The UI is clunky and dated for a game that was released in 2015.

Loading time on first launch is way too long for a game that has a very distinct pixel art style - plenty of other games in the same genre manage to have relatively swift loading times.

It doesn't seem like a whole lot of indepth research was put into the groundwork of this game at all, it looked like it was going to have a lot of depth and character, but it feels very shallow.

Controls are not that intuitive, if. you're going to make a sandbox genre game that copies elements from successful ones - maybe also copy control schemes that are prove to work.

The UI is clunky and dated for a game that was released in 2015.

Loading time on first launch is way too long for a game that has a very distinct pixel art style - plenty of other games in the same genre manage to have relatively swift loading times.

It doesn't seem like a whole lot of indepth research was put into the groundwork of this game at all, it looked like it was going to have a lot of depth and character, but it feels very shallow.

31532681,english,2017.04.04 03:16,❌,✅,0.4888268411,0,"Oh boy...

I had confidence in this game.  A friend as pond I discovered it when browsing Steam and when we saw it had ""Terraria"" content in it (even to the point of Terraria having a window message saying ""Also try Edge of Space""), and we were such big fans of that, we just had to get it.  I bought this game in a ""buy one get one free"" deal so we could do co-op together.  I tried to play this game I really tried, but there's just not enough redeeming qualities I could find to make this review positive.

First, I'd like to say I have been playing in early access rather than the full release, as I got bored during early access and couldn't even bring myself to boot it up again.  This game expects far too much from it's players.  You're practically playing a sandbox game stuck in hard mode, and forced to play with horrible controls.  There are way too many sub-menus to navigate, and the crafting system is so weird and doesn't make enough sense.

In games like this (i.e. Minecraft, Terraria, Starbound), we as players tend to remember the best crafting recipes, but Edge of Space takes the fun of that away and makes things over-complicated by having blocks fall into particular groups and letting you do the rest from there.

Every aspect of what makes this a ""sandbox"" game is terrible.  Placing blocks isn't satisfying as the one planet you're stuck on only offers you so many that you really might as well go to dirt to construct a ""house"" to stay the night.  Mining is extremely boring, and not engaging in the slightest.  I don't know if it was just me, but all ores in the game (which look far too identical to regular stone) took far too long to mine, and the steam icons that show your progress on obtaining the ore really don't change a lot so you'll be wondering how long it'll take to get anything from a vein.  Combat is also dumb.  Right when they drop you into this game, you have limited respawns, granted you can collect more.  But fighting in this game is just boring, it has no depth to it like in Terraria or Starbound and the enemies deal far too much damage that you basically fire at them from a distance the entire fight.  Not to mention these creeps spawn in caves and will interrupt your mining ALL THE TIME!

After coming back to this game and seeing the negative reviews it's getting and seeing how the Devs apparently abandoned it entirely, I'm honestly just disappointed.  There WAS hope for Edge of Space at one point, but when you release your game completely and it has a bunch of the bugs that already existed in EA, then you're basically just making an incomplete game to get a quick buck.

Don't buy this game.  If you want a thrilling space-themed sandbox game buy Starbound.  You'll get a lot more enjoyment out of it than whatever you can call this.

(Oh and co-op doesn't work at all.  You'll give up when you reach a point where you keep disconnecting from your friend's server.)","Oh boy...

The jetpack a little overabuse you will always fight the gravity avoid big fail.
Sudden brake not work like most the game you only slow down gradualy until you can fly up.
(that really make sense and add a challenge.)
   
THe boss fight kinda very long and some move seem unavoidable and hit very hard,

I really have fun and it challenging but a few thing can be annoying.
I like how the crafting can use many kind of simillar material instead a specific one.


Starbound and terraria better.
but if you looking for a nice challenge that a good alternative it quite unique."

It seemed VERY promising at first.  So, I decided to put it on hold and come back once a few updates had been released for it.  Unfortunately, by the time I did come back...the developers had pretty much abandoned the game.

Now, that's not the only problem - the other problem is that you gather resources too slowly; now, you could make that argument about Terraria or Starbound, but there's a difference: in those game, it's it was slow at first because you needed to update your tools; and over time, you upgraded your tools, reducing the time it takes to gather resources.  Not to mention that they gave you other stuff to do in the meantime, like quests, boss battles, or exploring dungeons.  Here, it's because the things you need to upgrade are too hard to find.  It takes WAY too long to make something like a house - in Terraria, you can have a simple house up by nightfall; in Starbound, it's a bit longer if you decide to build a base on a planet instead of your ship, but it's still completable in a reasonable amount of time; in this game? ...You'll be lucky if you're even done with a quarter of the house by that time.

Even then, the other problem is that...well, once you get past the tutorial, it's empty.  There's nothing obvious for you to do.  This is because of the lack of an NPC to give you hints like in Terraria or a quest system like in Stardew Valley.  At that point, it feels like a 2D Version of No Man's Sky, minus the ability to go to other planets (to be fair though, at least this game doesn't cost nearly as much as NMS).

It's a pity that this game is now abandonware, since it does have some good ideas - I like the power system idea, since it makes you plan out your base; also, the research system is a good idea in theory (although in execution, it fails).

If the developers ever decide to pick this game back up and start updating it again, I might give it a second shot, but at the moment, I cannot recommend this game.

If you're contemplating buying this game, I would suggest passing on it and instead picking up Terraria, which does the idea of a 2d Sandbox game a lot better (not to mention it's cheaper); but if the sci-fi element is a must for you, go for Starbound instead, since while the worlds in that game aren't as big as the worlds in this game, the rest of the content more than makes up for that.

The graphics are pretty good, the weapons and armor were fun to play around with and to fit different play styles the PIOS was ambitious and confusing at first, but does work. That said it, among many other things, still need work. The game never left beta and only did because the company folded. 

Bugs/crashing: I didn't come across any bugs. Not to say they don't exist or might be in the late game content though. Not one crash. Sure 15 hours isn't a ton of playtime, but that is still 15 hours without a single crash. (window 7 64, AMD, ATI hardware)

Abandonment: Don't pay full price if you are curious about the game, wait for a sale or bundle etc. I have to say that for me, it was worth the money spent (5$) for the time spent and amount of enjoyment I received. That said though, I don't really want to support a publisher who leaves unfinished games to just cash in on. A price reduction is certainly in order.

TL:DR - sound gfx and gameplay was fun but game was abandoned so any bugs/problems will never get fixed. Get on sale or skip. Or get Terraria.","Most of the reviews point out the same thing, the game is abandoned by the devs. So why do I recommend the game?

Welp, if you are reading this I applaud you. 
I'm just gonna go all James Rofle on this.
With a name like ""Edge of Space"" yo feel as though there will be some adventure involved.
In the time it took to figure out how to install this hot pile of flaming garbage, I could have actually gone on an adventure to the stars, and met real aliens.
In the time it takes to create a character, I could have become the next Bill Gates.
In the time it takes the world generator to generate worlds, I was able to cook all of my family's christmas dinner.

(above was the TL;DR)

To start, I am running an Alienware area 51, with a an 8tb HDD, a 512gb ssd, 32 gigs of ddr4 overclocked to 5.8 gigahertz per second, an nvidia titan graphics card with 8 gb of onboard video memory...

During the install, the game got stuck at 12% for about an hour and a half, I had to restart the install 35 times before it actually passed that point. Next, the game wouldn't even load, like at all... I'm doing everything I can think of to fix this (aside from making a satanic sacrifice to Belzebub, and sacrficing the blood of the lamb, and the heart of the goat(jk))

After fixing the not launching problem, I waited at the ""made with unity"" screen for about an hour [3:00 pm].
After that, I had to create an avatar, and was completely unimpressed with the ""creation"".
I then had to generate a world, which was great, It gave me time to make the stuffing, mash the potatos, roast the turkey,  toss the salad, bake the kings cake, warm up my vocal cords to sing ""God rest you merry gentleman"" on the bass cleft, go caroling, throw the green bean casserole in the oven, have eggnog and share stories with old friends, (you get the picture).... and it still wasnt even half way done creating the world [7:00 pm].

finally at 11 pm, it had finished...




I waited for a few seconds, and then was pleased(hardcore sarcasam) with the results. terrible graphics, sketchy sound quality, and non responsive controls. after 30 minutes of gameplay, it had crashed, BSOD'ed in fact, I could have spent the $3.74 on a cheap pocket knife.

Nobody entirely understands what happened exactly.
I bought the game in it's Early Access. Was fun, despite the piles of bugs and issues all around everywhere.
Updates were consistent, and everything looked great! I always checked the news to see what wonderfull things they brought into the game, and it was fun trying out those features! Bugs were smashed, problems solved, and additional content added on the way. Everything looked pretty great!
Until it happened...
Still missing tons of content, they suddenly for no reason released the game!
One moment, there are regular updates with content and stuff and then poof, game released.
The soundtrack was amazing, perfectly fitting the environment, and better equipment was being added so that players could get to deeper biomes.
Then they decided to release it half-baked. There aren't even armor sets that would let you reach the deepest biomes!
Many biomes can't be reached at all! And tons of other stuff was missing still!
Combat was still very annoying, with enemies being extremely agile, having a very tiny hit-box, which sometimes wasn't even on the enemy! There was a crab enemy infamous of it's mis-placed hit box, because of which you could only hit it if you fire above it.
They kept releasing very tiny bug fix updates and smaller content updates, that only seemed to make them look like they were alive, when they didn't really add anything important.
Now, they have been silent for a long time.
The last post was a sort of ""We are not dead but lots-a stuff going on now"" post. They said in max a few months they would explain things. That post was put up in April.
Although nobody knows exactly what happened behind the curtains, but the most common idea is that the developers over time lost their determination to keep on going, and released the game early, turning it into a cash-grab.
The fact that even now, not having responded to anything for months, the game still gets put on sale, and once it was even sighted on humble bundle, only supports this cash grab idea even more. And then again, like i mentioned previously , before they went silent, they were releasing fake updates, that added nothing but thin-air to the game, only so that they make others think that the game is alive, when it is not.

TL;DR: Another early access game that had the potential and fun, but it mysteriously died out. Now it is only a carcass of a game that once was full of promise.

Once again, for a final time: Don't waste your money on this! I beg you...

Then they decided to release it half-baked. There aren't even armor sets that would let you reach the deepest biomes!
Many biomes can't be reached at all! And tons of other stuff was missing still!
Combat was still very annoying, with enemies being extremely agile, having a very tiny hit-box, which sometimes wasn't even on the enemy! There was a crab enemy infamous of it's mis-placed hit box, because of which you could only hit it if you fire above it.
They kept releasing very tiny bug fix updates and smaller content updates, that only seemed to make them look like they were alive, when they didn't really add anything important.
Now, they have been silent for a long time.
The last post was a sort of ""We are not dead but lots-a stuff going on now"" post. They said in max a few months they would explain things. That post was put up in April.
Although nobody knows exactly what happened behind the curtains, but the most common idea is that the developers over time lost their determination to keep on going, and released the game early, turning it into a cash-grab.
The fact that even now, not having responded to anything for months, the game still gets put on sale, and once it was even sighted on humble bundle, only supports this cash grab idea even more. And then again, like i mentioned previously , before they went silent, they were releasing fake updates, that added nothing but thin-air to the game, only so that they make others think that the game is alive, when it is not.

TL;DR: Another early access game that had the potential and fun, but it mysteriously died out. Now it is only a carcass of a game that once was full of promise.

Once again, for a final time: Don't waste your money on this! I beg you...

(Сыро, очень сыро)

У игры очень большой потенциал, но то что есть сейчас, лучше даже не запускать. Ви гре много различных, интересных элементов, которые бы отлично смотрелись в том же Старбаунде, но всё (абсолютно всё) в игре недоделанно.
Много различного оружия, но оно однообразно и не интересно. 
Куча всяких декоративных элементов, которые радуют глаз, но и ими заниматься не интересно.
Огромный мир, который совсем не интересно исследовать.
Оригинальные враги, но их мало и бои с нимим скучны.
А самое главное, что я так и не понял, закончилась игра или нет. Рнчь не о том, что ф игре есть фриплей после финального босса (я так думаю, что это был именно он), а о том, что ничего с его победой не меняется и не происходит, а для победы нужно просто долго фармить перед встречей.
В подобных, копательно-пулятельных играх, фарм и крафтинг это основа, но тут этот процесс крайне скучный.

Пока, игра совсем не конкурент ни Террарии, ни Старбаунду.",

-Creative ideas, you know, the first thing I didn't think of was a flying, talking, robot shark in space
-Quantity, there is so much stuff to explore and find, it's ridiculous
-Natural spawns, I love how the first thing a explored was a zombie containment plant
-Plot, not much plot, you get lost in another planet, galaxy, whatever, then you explore it
-Jet Pack, Cool, and i love how you start with it and you can explore terrain easier
-Potential, this game has MASSIVE potential, it needs more stuff though

Cons
-What do i do, like seriously, I have no idea what i'm doing, none of my friends have this game so i can't ask anyone
-it seems like it's copying starboun-- no it can't be... can it?

-it takes a second to load up, and the frames are not great but not bad, and I have a pretty good Graphics card

Needs

Developers realized their game wasn't working out and had too many issues to fix.  But instead of telling their customers this, they rushed to a ""Full Release"" version that was hilariously unfinished in September 2015 so they could get the game featured on the Steam Store Front Page right before the holidays.

They strung it along further by releasing constant ""Minor updates"" up through December 2015.  These updates weren't actually intended to fix their horribly broken game, but intended to keep it showing on the Steam Store Front Page as ""Recently Updated"" throughout the 2015 holiday season.

In January 2016, by all appearances, this developer had stopped all development.  The community manager had left, they were inactive on Social Media and Steam, and nothing was done to fix the games issues.

In April 2016, they posted a vague ""Please be patient"" message on Steam via a private steam account (Which, to this day, doesn't respond to inquiries about the game).  By ""Coincidence"", one month later, in May 2016, the game is featured in a Humble Indie Bundle.

That's the only way this kinda crap is going to stop.","THIS GAME IS AN EARLY ACCESS SCAM

Developers realized their game wasn't working out and had too many issues to fix.  But instead of telling their customers this, they rushed to a ""Full Release"" version that was hilariously unfinished in September 2015 so they could get the game featured on the Steam Store Front Page right before the holidays.

They strung it along further by releasing constant ""Minor updates"" up through December 2015.  These updates weren't actually intended to fix their horribly broken game, but intended to keep it showing on the Steam Store Front Page as ""Recently Updated"" throughout the 2015 holiday season.

In January 2016, by all appearances, this developer had stopped all development.  The community manager had left, they were inactive on Social Media and Steam, and nothing was done to fix the games issues.

In April 2016, they posted a vague ""Please be patient"" message on Steam via a private steam account (Which, to this day, doesn't respond to inquiries about the game).  By ""Coincidence"", one month later, in May 2016, the game is featured in a Humble Indie Bundle.  The April Post was done simply to make potential Humble Bundle buyers believe that the game is being actively developed and supported were they to check it's news page.  The devs apparently had no intention of continuing work on the game, they just wanted to string folks along and milk every last dime they could from sales, even from within the Humble Bundle.

I was trying to wait out for updates, I was trying to wait for the developers to come back from their ""logistics stuff"" that they've been doing for months (it doesn't take that long for someone or even multiple people to move), and the developers have seemingly fallen off the face of the planet (maybe into the Edge of Space!? lol, couldn't resist, sorry).

Starbound did a similar thing where Chucklefish relocated their entire company, but yet here's the thing: Chucklefish at least continued to maintain their website, and actually continued communications with the playerbase. Since Handyman Studios posted that update in April (It is October as I write this), there hasn't been any communication whatsoever, except for 1 tweet that advertised the game being on sale somewhere.

So, since this appears to be abandonware, I believe I can attach my own review of this game.

Do I recommend it as it is now? NO.
Do I think it could be a good game? YES, but only if the developers actually come back.
Do I hope they would come back and make it better? YES!

The game has a nice premise going for it, but there are simply too many things wrong with it to make it an actual good purchase. If you really want a tech demo to mess around with, maybe for inspiration or ideas, go ahead. I'd wait until it's on sale, though.

So, Pros/Cons:

Pros: 

-A nice recipe unlock system
-Good graphics for a sidescrolling indie game
-Lots of inventive ideas (pets, character upgrades, etc)
-A unique take on the sandbox exploration game (you progress by going down)
-You start with a jetpack

Cons:

-Control/UI Bugs (your character will shoot their weapon or use their tool while dragging items around in the UI)
-Unfinished game and obvious missing content (the last two biomes are not finished, some tech unlocks are empty)
-Blah combat (you always feel weak as bleeep because your guns all suck, and it takes 10+ shots to kill anything)
-Melee combat is useless
-Cheap enemies that can fly through solid walls to attack you
-Dungeons are buggy, some of those bugs were fixed in the last update, but some remain from what I've been told
-No Real Map System (this is the huge deal-breaker for me -- you only have a ""current"" minimap of what you can currently see and that's it)
-Somewhat clunky UI system (inventory management, everything freshly obtained gets dumped into the hotbar etc)
-UI LAG. Yes, the UI lags when trying to move items around.

Recap: A game that has/had a lot of potential but sadly fell way short. I tried hard to like this game, because when I first started playing it, I was like ""I hope they finish this game or make it better!"" But sadly.. it doesn't look like that will ever come to pass.

The developers appear to have disappeared. Even the Handyman Studios website has long gone down.

Edge of Space is far from a finished product, yet it appears that the Devs pushed a 1.0 release, a few fixes post release, then abandoned the whole game.

Most disappointing, particularly as the game was sold with “Official Terraria” themed objects suggesting it would be a game of the same standard. It is not.

Thoroughly disappointing and in it’s current state I would have to say a very clear “DO NOT BUY”."

If you haven't played for an adult, you have to start the game from scratch. You create a new world, and it takes 15 minutes to load, but it's 90% stuck and you can't even enter the world. Also, looking at the so-called news, the latest was on April 30th, which, judging by other comments, should be 2016. There was an announcement of a pause in updates. Those Russians are so irresponsible! They take money, play a couple of games, and then leave...

The Special Edition didn't even work when the game was 'released', it just kept crashing the game. I wasted a 25 dollar giftcard I could have bought StarBound with, what a disapointing mess.

Definitely think a few things could change but it wasn't as bad as some of these reviews seem to be portraying it.  I didn't like the completely polarised armour for sure.  If you want a decent amount of inventory you need to give up health and damage, if you want damage you can't have inventory or health, etc.  That bugged me because I don't want to keep 3 sets of armour on me at all times just in case.  I think the worst thing though is that in the late tier you get some special weapons and tools but they can only be used while wearing a very specific armour.  So unless you want to carry that armour and the tool these great items become entirely useless.  Levelling also seems to be a huge grind.  I ended up just creating the machines that mine quickly and straight up hollowing out entire massive chunks of land to get the xp (I think it has a name in the game though, like Research or something instead of xp).  I still found it fun to progress solo, though.  One of this games big issues is the crafting system.  It would be really nice if you could initiate crafting while in a chest's inventory so that both your inventory and the chest's would be checked for crafting materials.  Its really annoying to have to constantly take small things from chests for each thing you need to make, especially since there are so many different materials in this game (which is a good thing but cumbersome in this case).

Tl;dr Its a good game but it takes a bit of dedication.  And if you aren't the type to look past small issues or annoyances then this might not be great for you.","Took a bit to get into but overall I liked it.

The Penguin music alone is worth the money I paid for this game while it's on sale.  There's 3 completed biomes of enemies, thousands of items, I think like 45+ full sets of armor, 3 seperate lines with different attribute upgrades and abilities, and a bunch of alien techs to find that upgrade your passives.

In short I'm completely happy with my purchase.  I hope they add more content in the future but I well got my moneys worth.  This game in alpha felt more complete then most of the crap I buy nowadays anyways.  It plays ALOT like Terraria.     I have no idea why so many haters due to one biome being unfinished, but I'd totally recommend this game, especially if you like Terraria.  Don't listen to the haters."

The Crafting and building is ok but the grind to get the needed ressources for better equipment is plain boring and way to slow and the building Options are to limited.

I think that in it's current state the game shows a ton of potential and has some very great features. I really like the Terraria/Starbound 2D worldcraft type gameplay and the controls/combat of this particular title does the style justice. If you're a fan of these, this game is a must-play as it is a bit more forgiving than Starbound or Terraria in some ways but also very challenging in it's own right.

Positives:
There is a great amount of appealing content in the game so far. The combat is a lot of fun. I like how easy it is to find and upgrade resources as well as unlocking content by simply fighting monsters and mining. Each (fighting/mining) give you exp points equally. There are also mini-dungeons you come across regularly to clear out. These in addition to deployable tower defense and other styles of mini-game dungeons adds a fun spin to the roguelike worldcraft indie style.

Negative:
The biggest issues I have with the game are stability issues and bugs. After initially binging on the game for several hours, I lost everything I had built due to a client crash. I still had my character and all the inventory, but the planet/area's safe file was corrupted so I had to start from a fresh new save. This made me lose all my storage and the structures/bases I had built.  Also it seems that about half the time the game has trouble deploying your character as playable into the world. Sometimes the screen is dark and everything responds, but you cannot move or take control of your avatar. It is easily fixed by a restart or two (if it happens sequentially). 

Neutral:
This game isn't a solid world like in Terraria or Starbound. There are large open spaces inbetween land masses that you must use your jet pack to travel between while heading deeper in the map without taking damage on impact as the gravity is similar to that of earth. This I feel like has both negative and positive effects for creating elevator shafts and fast-travel between different levels. For instance, one thing I liked about terraria was creating an easily navigated mine-shaft to drop very deep very quickly, although in this you can just build a teleporter wherever you want and teleport straight to it. So it really allows you to focus on more combat if you want to.

End thoughts. Worth overall. I will update my review as it is developed.","Overall:

It has a nice mix of Terraria-style exploring and base building and fast-paced Metroid-style shooting. It has vehicles, a decent progression system, quests and NPCs.

-Das Spiel hat sehr viele arten von Waffen

-Das Spiel hat verschiedene crafting Stationen

-Das Spiel besitzt auch sehr viele arten von Rüstungen

-Es gibt auch Bösse im Spiel (Macht Spaß zu Bekämpfen wenn man auch die richtige Ausrüstung hat)

-Man kann auch Mehrspieler spielen (Ich denke nicht das es server gibt)

-Es gibt sehr viele arten von Gegnern

-Das Spiel besitzt verschiede und auch viele Fahrzeuge

-Das Spiel hat auch viele arten von Blöcken

-Das Spiel hat einfach so viel Inhalt das es für einige nicht mehr möglich ist irgenwie durchzuschauen

-Das Spiel ist also nicht für jeden geeignet

Ingesamtbewertung:8/10","Edge of Space is a game that's hard to navigate because there's so much to do, but if you play the game long enough, it all becomes less complicated.

-The game has many types of weapons

-The game has various crafting stations

-The game also has many types of armor

-There are also bosses in the game (fun to fight if you have the right equipment)

-You can also play multiplayer (I don't think there are servers)

-There are many types of enemies

-The game has many different vehicles

-The game also has many types of blocks

-The game simply has so much content that it's impossible for some to keep track of it all

-So the game isn't suitable for everyone

Exploring: its pretty standard, you go out find monsteres and stuff and you need to kill them to get their materials. most are nutral, some aren't. they have little zones with events like ""kill the zombies"", ""kill the crabs, ""Save an NPC"" which are fun but super short, like done in 1 min and thats it"" 

Building: building is pretty similar to other games of its like. you dont need as many as other games from what i can tell. 
getting new building recipes is pretty unique. you get XP for everything you do, and you trade in that xp for new teirs of items. 

Fighting: the fighting was pretty standard, thir weapons and teir systems are so annoying that finding the right weapons was just a chore. it doesn't say what the possible damage of the weapons are you just have to build them and hope it was worth the materials. 

mining: its pretty standared, nothing special. im sure it might get better later on, but ill never find out. but within the first few levels of you mining laser, it was pretty standard. 

Organization: their teir system wasn't done well AT ALL. i only got about half way through it and i found myself getting frustrated when trying to find stuff. like they have mark1weapons and forward, and if you need a mark1weapon you can't just search ""mark1weapon, you need to click on each weapon and see what kind it is, got really annoying. there are some items that are broken in this game that you can't get, but im sure they will fix it in the future but for now it makes it impossible to get any of those items. 

Dungeons: these just suck... like hard, they tried to make them a cool platform area, but they aren't they just suck and are annoying as all hell, and when you die you have to start from the beginning and fight your way back to where you were at. and if you wanted to get all the material you need from these dungeons you have to spend hours and hours in them. its just not fun. then there is another dungeon where its a boss one and its fucking impossible, i barely did any damage and died almost imediatly, and icouldn't build anything else untill i got those materials from thsi dungeon. 
(there might have been stuff that i could have built but there was no fucknig way to figure out what i needed to maybe beat him, the organizaion of items in this game are fucking BAD. there might have been items to help me, but damned if i could find them.)

all in all this game still has a long way to go and if you don't mind dealing with a game that has alot of work ahead of it, then have fun, but i for one stopped having funa round the 10hour mark and was just hoping it would get less frustrating, and it didn't 20 hours in and im done, im just interested in anything else this game has to offer, it seems like the further i go the more problems there are. they need to stop adding things to this game and fix the problems at hand.","well ive spent about 20 hours on this game and i can say that at this point the game is just not worth playing anymore.

Organization: their teir system wasn't done well AT ALL. i only got about half way through it and i found myself getting frustrated when trying to find stuff. like they have mark1weapons and forward, and if you need a mark1weapon you can't just search ""mark1weapon, you need to click on each weapon and see what kind it is, got really annoying. there are some items that are broken in this game that you can't get, but im sure they will fix it in the future but for now it makes it impossible to get any of those items. 

Dungeons: these just suck... like hard, they tried to make them a cool platform area, but they aren't they just suck and are annoying as all hell, and when you die you have to start from the beginning and fight your way back to where you were at. and if you wanted to get all the material you need from these dungeons you have to spend hours and hours in them. its just not fun. then there is another dungeon where its a boss one and its fucking impossible, i barely did any damage and died almost imediatly, and icouldn't build anything else untill i got those materials from thsi dungeon. 
(there might have been stuff that i could have built but there was no fucknig way to figure out what i needed to maybe beat him, the organizaion of items in this game are fucking BAD. there might have been items to help me, but damned if i could find them.)

all in all this game still has a long way to go and if you don't mind dealing with a game that has alot of work ahead of it, then have fun, but i for one stopped having funa round the 10hour mark and was just hoping it would get less frustrating, and it didn't 20 hours in and im done, im just interested in anything else this game has to offer, it seems like the further i go the more problems there are. they need to stop adding things to this game and fix the problems at hand."

(I'm sure the Early Access period was the time to do this, but as Lady Ajew the damage controller stated; it was the perfect time for a Full Release!?)

I have over 600 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. 

One Hour Reviews #54 - Edge of Space

You'll get an immediate sense of the quirky writing in Edge of Space as you start by having a conversation with a talking shark.  There isn't that much of a story to tell, just that your spaceship crashed and now you are stranded on a planet.  The writing is definitely tongue-in-cheek.

I liked how the game began, and appreciated that it wasn't too difficult to begin with.  Although I do wish they had explained some things a little better.  The game includes a ""tutorial video"" that I felt was kind of a shortcut, as opposed to just better integrating a tutorial into the game.  Still, the first set of quests you get involve gathering various components to then craft into items, which is a pretty major part of the gameplay.

I wish the controls were better.  I found mining to be frustrating at times.  You use a mining pick that you aim with your mouse.  But the aim is weird at times.  I kept wanting to just point my mouse cursor at a block to mine.  But the aim is actually based on the position of your cursor relative to a point on your body in order to determine direction.  This means sometimes, even when your mouse cursor is on a block, the aim is actually causing the laser to hit a different block.  It's a minor annoyance but mining is such a major part of the gameplay that it definitely adds up.

If you've played Terraria, then you'll pretty much know exactly what to expect here.  It's pretty hard not to consider this game a knock off.  There are some minor differences with crafting, like the way you can use different items to fill a recipe.  But as a whole the gameplay feels extremely familiar.   I don't hold it against Edge of Space for being a knock off, but when you're borrowing from another game, you should at least make some notable improvements.  And it really doesn't feel that way.  And when you add the fact that Terraria is cheaper ($14.99 vs. $9.99 regular prices), I really can't recommend this game unless you've just played Terraria to death and want to scratch that itch with a different game.","

Sadly, this is the one area where Edge of Space really fails to deliver. The art isn't bad, the worlds are imaginative, and some aspects of gameplay are actually very fun!

At a certain point in the game, progression through the tech-tree is halted by materials that can only be obtained from a dungeon. No problem! Except the dungeons are awful. The freedom of your jetpack and mining laser are stripped from you, and you're forced to clumsily hop along through some kind of half-baked platformer full of dark, confusing, repetitive rooms. Exploring the rest of the dungeon after going down a dead-end branch involves slowly backtracking through rooms that are even harder to navigate in reverse. It's so tedious that it's easier to just die so that you can start again from the top. The drop-rate for those materials you need is abysmal to boot.

It's a fun game the soundtrack is fairly nice and honestly I was a bit shocked to see people saying its a buggy mess perhaps I played right after major bug fixes were put in because my only problem is random hitching (2-3 second freeze which im guessing is a worldsave or trash collection that isn't optimized due to unity being a bit bad at stock).

The game has changed a lot since i played it when it first came out, it's a bit more non linear then some games and doesn't seem to have a clearcut path but that isn't a dealbreaker for me.  All in all the enemies are diverse and I've gotten about 10 tiers out of 15 into some of the research in a fairly short stint of time.   I would say it still meets my 1$ per hour level of entertainment quota making this game a suggested game in my opinion.

It's a fun game the soundtrack is fairly nice and honestly I was a bit shocked to see people saying its a buggy mess perhaps I played right after major bug fixes were put in because my only problem is random hitching (2-3 second freeze which im guessing is a worldsave or trash collection that isn't optimized due to unity being a bit bad at stock).

The game has changed a lot since i played it when it first came out, it's a bit more non linear then some games and doesn't seem to have a clearcut path but that isn't a dealbreaker for me.  All in all the enemies are diverse and I've gotten about 10 tiers out of 15 into some of the research in a fairly short stint of time.   I would say it still meets my 1$ per hour level of entertainment quota making this game a suggested game in my opinion.

21341257,japanese,2016.01.20 18:35,❌,❌,0.8616188765,84,"面白い、しかしゲームとしての作りがおかしい。
テラリア的な2Dサンドボックスゲームとして10-20時間楽しめるだけの内容はある。致命的なシステムの不備やバグなども最新のパッチではほぼ解消されており、ゲームをプレイするのに大きな支障は無い。しかし、ゲームコンテンツが根本的に未完成であり、ゲーム序盤には充実してたコンテンツがゲームを進めるにつれ薄くなっていく作りはプレイしていて冷める感がある。またゲームが完結してないためクリアーなど目標が無く、モチベーションを維持しづらい。

テラリア系2Dサンドボックスゲームとしては標準的な作りであり、探索、採掘、戦闘、アクション、どれに偏ったと言う事も無く、バリエーション豊かなゲームプレイが用意されている。強いて言えば建築要素は薄く感じる。
システム面では、戦闘や採掘によって得られた経験値を使ってレシピを解放、レシピから必要アイテムを確認する事が出来るので、途中でWikiを確認などの煩わしさもない。作れるアイテムもSF的で様々な遠距離武器や飛行ユニット、乗り物やペットなど、豊富なパターンと実用性を持った物も多い。
また条件をクリアーする事で行く事の出来る特殊なマップでは建築や採掘が出来ない純粋な2Dアクションやボス戦も用意されている。
ハッキリ言って序盤は面白いし、面白かったし、可能性も感じた。
しかし、進むにつれこのゲームの未完成部分が現れてくると、期待感は失望感に変わる。

余りにも全方位的に何でもありのゲームを作ろうとした結果か、このゲームは途中から極端に完成度が落ちてくる。
まず、バイオームと言ってこのゲームは下に進むにつれ大体五層程度の環境が階層的に重なった構造になって居るが、このバイオームがきちんと作られて居るのは三階層しか無い。三階層よりも下にはただ土ブロックが敷き詰められた何も無い空間が存在するだけとなっている。また、戦闘バランスやイベントがきちんと充実しているのは基本的に第一階層のみで、第二第三階層はほぼ新鉱石と敵が居るだけと言った感がある。
ゲームを進めてもラスボス的な物は存在せず、序盤に数体用意されたボス以外にゲーム進行の目安になる存在は居なくなるので、途中からただ雑魚を倒して鉱石を掘って新たな武器防具を作る以外の目的が無くなる。
結局、このゲームがきちんと作られて居ると感じられるのは序盤の10時間程度で、それ以降は完全に作りかけとしか言い様のない状態に陥る。更にクリアー目的なども存在しないので、最後はひたすら「このゲームはどこまで未完成なのか」を確かめる程度しか、プレイする意味が無くなる。

自分がプレイしてこのレビューを書いてる間にも何度かアップデートは行われたようなので、開発者のやる気が低いわけではない。しかし、パッチの修正リストを見る限り殆どは小さなバグの修正ばかりで、このレビューに書いたようなゲーム全体の未完成っぷりを改善するような大規模な修正は行われていない。そもそも、このゲームのアーリーアクセスから正式発売までの期間を考えても、それだけの時間をかけてこの完成度ならば、正直この開発会社ではこの規模のゲームを完成させる事が出来るとは思えない。ただ、将来大きな改善が行われてる可能性もあるので、このレビューの書かれた日時は確認して欲しい。

残念な事に（幸いな事に？）このゲームは全く面白く無い訳では無い。未完成な上に面白く無ければ、ただクソゲーと書けば終わりだったのだが、少なくとも自分は序盤10時間程度は面白かった事は確かなので、この様に未完成である事を理解した上で10時間程度楽しめればよいと言った感覚ならば、プレイする価値はあると思う。・・・ただ、それでも人に勧めるのは難しい。","It's fun, but the gameplay is a bit odd.
As a Terraria-style 2D sandbox game, it has enough content to provide 10-20 hours of enjoyment. The latest patch has largely addressed critical system flaws and bugs, and there are no major obstacles to gameplay. However, the game's content is fundamentally incomplete, and the rich content early on thins out as you progress, which can be a bit boring. Also, because the game isn't complete, there's no clear goal to complete, making it difficult to maintain motivation.

The gameplay is standard for a Terraria-style 2D sandbox game, offering a wide variety of gameplay elements, without leaning too heavily toward exploration, mining, combat, or action. If I had to say, the building element feels a bit weak.
In terms of the system, you can unlock recipes using experience points gained from combat and mining, and check the required items from the recipes, eliminating the hassle of checking the Wiki along the way. The items you can craft are sci-fi-inspired, with a wide variety of patterns and practicalities, including a variety of long-range weapons, flying units, vehicles, and pets.
Additionally, special maps that can be accessed by clearing certain conditions feature pure 2D action and boss battles where building and mining are not possible.
To be honest, the early stages were fun and exciting, and I could sense its potential.
However, as you progress, the game's unfinished parts begin to appear, and my excitement turns to disappointment.

Perhaps the result of trying too hard to make a game that allows anything to happen in every direction, the game's level of completion drops drastically midway through.
First of all, the game has a hierarchical structure of roughly five layers of environments stacked on top of each other as you progress, but only three levels of these biomes are properly created. Below the third level there is simply an empty space covered in dirt blocks. Furthermore, only the first level has properly balanced combat and events, while the second and third levels feel like they're mostly just filled with new ores and enemies.
There's no final boss or anything like that even as you progress through the game, and other than a few early bosses, there's no other indicator of progress. So, halfway through, there's no other purpose beyond defeating enemies, digging up ore, and crafting new weapons and armor.
Ultimately, the game only feels well-crafted for the first 10 hours or so; after that, it feels completely unfinished. Furthermore, since there's no clear goal to complete, the only point of playing is to see how unfinished the game is.

While I was playing and writing this review, several updates were released, so the developers' enthusiasm isn't lacking. However, judging from the patch fix list, most of them address minor bugs, and no major changes that would address the overall incompleteness of the game, as I've written in this review. Considering the time between this game's early access release and its official release, I honestly don't think this development company could complete a game of this scale after such a long time. However, it's possible that major improvements have been made in the future, so please check the date and time this review was written.

Unfortunately (or fortunately?), this game isn't completely unfun. If it were unfinished and unfun, I would simply call it a crappy game and be done with it, but I can at least say that I found the first 10 hours or so fun, so if you understand that it's unfinished and are happy to enjoy it for around 10 hours, then I think it's worth playing. ...But even so, it's still difficult to recommend it to others."

Пропускаем  подобие  сюжета  и  вот  мы  в  мирке  парящих  кусков  земли  и  камня.  Радостное  восклицание:  “Космос!”  –  захлёбывается  в  невозможности  выйти  в  этот  самый  космос,  ибо  мы  итак  на  самом  верху  мира  и  копать  предстоит  исключительно  вглубь.  Ладно,  мы  любим  копать,  иначе  не  играли  бы  в  игры  такого  жанра.  Чтобы  зарываться  всё  глубже  и  глубже  необходимо  поднимать  защитный  уровень  своей  амуниции,  а  для  этого  её  сначала  надо  изучить  за  опыт,  который  даётся  за…  копание  и  убийство  монстров.  В  принципе  выглядит  неплохо,  но  лишь  до  тех  пор,  пока  не  превращается  в  рутину.

Для  изготовления  вещей  нужно  много  всяких  дополнительных  ингредиентов.  Пусть  все  ресурсы  в  игре  делятся  на  общие  категории,  но  без  ключевых  компонентов  остальные  теряют  смысл.  Какая  разница,  что  можно  заменять  землю  глиной  или  камнями,  если  основной  ресурс  рецепта  строго  прописан  и  единственная  проблема  в  добыче  именно  его?  С  костюмами  штука  ещё  более  печальная,  так  как  костюмы  изготовляются  поэтапно  из  первого  класса  второй,  а  последние  так  вообще  требуют  смешать  несколько  разнотипных.  У  оружия  же  нельзя  посмотреть  ни  тип  действия,  ни  показатели  до  его  создания  –  покупаешь  кота  в  мешке,  иногда  за  последние  редкие  ресурсы,  получая  в  результате  какое-то  бесполезное  непотребство.  Так  что  создание  предметов  в  Edge  of  Space  –  запутанное  и  излишне  громоздкое  занятие.

А  вот  где  разнообразия  не  помешало  бы  так  это  в  подземельях.  Разрушая  маленькие  гнёзда  опасных  хищников  и  полярных  мишек  с  ракетницами,  мы  находим  фрагменты  данных,  что  позволяют  отправиться  в  подземелье  или  в  гости  к  боссу.  Если  боссы  это  своеобразная  арена  для  боя,  то  подземелье  –  группа  комнат,  связанная  в  некую  схему  от  двери  до  двери  и  до  заветных  ящичков  с  вкусным  содержимым.  Вот  только  уникальных  комнат  мало  и  они  постоянно  повторяются.  Выглядит  это  как-то  не  очень  презентабельно.

Резюме:  в  раннем  доступе  начиналось  всё  весьма  неплохо,  но,  к  сожалению,  ни  во  что  интересное  игра  так  и  не  выросла,  потому  не  могу  её  рекомендовать.",

I am really, but really impressed with this game. When I saw the others players reviews, I start to think what could be wrong with those negative reviews and I choose to see by my own eyes plus my experience and I can tell you securely: all is going nice and well here.

First for all, see my account details: I have 196 hours of Terraria and 149 of Starbound, and guys, this game has a lot of potential. Can almost surpass this two games right now, if they keep working on this game, maybe it can happen.

In the first hour playing this game, I liked everything, didn't have any issue with anything. They have a very nice progression sistem, the challenge rate of the game is very well done, many content to explore, craft, learn... Enemies are nice and have many dangerous.

Some guys said than is confuse, but I desagree. If you stop to read a little bit, you see than everything is quite understandable. Ill put some points of the game than are great potential if compared with other games like him, as Starbound for an example.

- Ambience. The amount of creatures, plants, all the ecosystem around you is very rich and alive. You don't have to walk so far to find ruins, dangerous creatures and radiation points.
- Transport. Great amount of options and all of them is very nice. Many of them is using some aliens, so you can imagine.
- Radiation levels. You never will know what place will have radiation until got your first step and start to die. Is a very nice hardcore surprise. No milk drinkers like this, I know, and I like it.
- Experience. Kill, mining, solving quests from regions (like exterminate nests of zombies for dominate the local), all of this give you experience points.
- Science progression. Here enters where you spend those experience points. You can focus on exploration, building, weapons, researching, transport,... I believe if you want to get all of this, you will have to play a good time, making things interesting.

This is all I saw in just one hour of play. I'll play more and redo that review from the game, but from now, I can say than the game is very well done, nice, quite of nice ideas implemented, worst every coin and is very enjoyable an playable.

Bigger map/minimap
Better tool aiming (I should be able to break a block right in front of me without moving back and forth)
Better introduction
Fewer items- Within an hour of playing you'll have at least 20 different stacks of items with no indication of their relative worth or even where they came from sometimes. Inventory fills up quick and there's no good way to manage it, especially when you need some items to craft something."

A distanza di un anno e mezzo, è ancora un enorme work in progress. Non lo trovo giocabile. I mob sono troppi e continuano a spawnare e impediscono addirittura di muoversi, si accumulano letteralmente negli angoli e se ti avvicini troppi rischi di venire trasportato via mentre stai cercando di camminare o prendere risorse. Il nuovo tutorial è costituito da un video in inglese senza sottotitoli e da un menu da cui non è possibile capire bene neanche i comandi. La mini mappa non funziona e ci sono diversi bug grafici. Non mi sta piacendo e lo dico da amante di Terraria e di Minecraft. Non mi aspettavo ovviamente lo stesso gioco, ma lo trovo difficile non tanto da giocare, ma proprio da usare. Spero ci saranno dei miglioramenti. Nel frattempo vi sconsiglio di comprarlo e aspettare che gli sviluppatori si schiodano un po' dalla via che stanno percorrendo, perchè per me non funziona.

They literally pile up in corners, and if you get too close, you risk being carried away while trying to walk or collect resources. The new tutorial consists of an English video without subtitles and a menu where you can't even understand the controls. The mini-map doesn't work, and there are several graphical bugs. I'm not enjoying it, and I say this as a Terraria and Minecraft fan. I obviously wasn't expecting the same game, but I find it difficult not so much to play, but to use.

I acquired this game in pre-Alpha back in 2013 and it was a rather RAW version of the game back then. The forums were kicking on the main webpage and wheels were turning with update ideas and the direction of the game. Fast forward 2-3 years and there is a lot of development, a lot of change, and a game that has been finished. There were many character wipes and world wipes along the way = That was to be expected. I bought it on pre-order before early access, and played for about 6-8 months through early access, so a few save wipes isn't a huge deal. 

However, I think another user said it best "" I think the negative reviews are born mostly out of frustration with how long the game took to get from early access to release."" 

Here we are three years later with a game that is no longer in Early Access but still has clunky controls and somewhat of a grind feel. However - it has come a long way, and if you came  here NOT expecting to grind in order to craft and survive, I don't know what you were expecting.

I played some of the most recent updates and will update my review from not recommended to recommended, but with a disclaimer attached: This game still doesn't feel 100% to me. But, Terraria never did either - far from it - and everyone loves to compare this title to Terraria. Terraria was lacking in story line, direction, but had an abundance of content and playability with constant updates. This game is proceeding along a similar path, but a  year or so ago they introduced a Tutorial stage at the beginning of the game. Instead of the tutorial level - the game now appears to have something else, that exists more as a dialogue feature that I won't spoil.

I""ll keep checking in on the updates as they come along.","I waited a long time to review this game, mainly because I don't like or want to contribute to negative reviews.

First problem I encountered that immediately threw me into a rage...audio crackling.

Normally I would believe this to be some sort of sound driver issue, but as someone who regularly uses Skype, Pandora, numerous other games and software with absolutely zero problem in sound, I found this to be the foreshadowing of the only stain in my library out of (currently) 147 other items. Reinstallation of drivers and the game itself has produced no fix. Fabulous.

Second issue, which I should say was already mentioned by someone else in the reviews on this item...sluggish gameplay. It feels like you're trying to swim through molasses. I was trying to gun down uh, floating jellyfish and other unpleasant critters and it felt like I was in a slow-motion Matrix scene (minus the badassery by a long shot, that is).

Third issue. There were no prominent enough sound effects for mining or busting something's skull in. I expected some splattering or crumbling or something. What I got was a piss-poor puff noise for most of it. Seriously? What kind of horse crap is this?

Fourth issue. I'm very happy I was able to adapt to the game itself as quickly as I did, because the game not pausing with the tutorial UI up in my face was extremely unsettling and left me open to get owned by the nearest hungry maw. Someone with very little experience with games like this will not be so fortunate in the future.

Fifth issue. This game  has some sloppy sprite work on the player avatars. Normally I would let this slide, but I know this game has been worked on for quite some time, so no, I am not going to let it go. Hell no. You can definitely tell a lot of the features you're able to add onto the avatar in creation were lazily pasted on. Thankfully, the fitting futuristic artwork helped balance it out.

Sixth issue. OH HOW CUTE THE GAME ONLY HAS A RESOLUTION CHANGE OPTION AND V-SYNC FOR GRAPHIC SELECTIONS. LOL WTF IS THIS, 2004?!

Edge of Space was supposed to be the answer to the demand of an outer space sandbox game like Terraria. In fact, when it was advertised, it was proclaiming to be better and a bit of a sequel to the installment. What a waste of cyberspace and time! Terraria is everything this game wanted to try to be. You know, functional and good?

In fact, if you want a good sandbox game similar to Terraria that occurs in space, either sit down with Minecraft and some mods, or get a game that actually does this shit right; STARBOUND.

Pros:
+ Has something like a main quest line
+ Has mini events that appear on the planet, with objectives
+ Has a crafting system with trees that look like they have a reasonable amount of items
+ Has an npc with a bunch of dialogue, uncommon for this genre
+ Has a strange (but interesting) artstyle that reminds me of AVwW, but a little different
+ Some of the equipment looks well drawn, and very nice as future outfits

Cons:
- Crafting system requires large amounts of materials to make mundane or low tier objects
- Enemies and destructibles drop lots of loot and it feels like my inventory is weighed down with junk just a few minutes into the game
- The tiered system for items/crafting isn't intuitive or sensible (other than weapons/tools named ""Mk. 1"", ""Mk.2"", etc.)
- The tiers locking you out of building or crafting some items feel arbitrary despite being in an already arbitrary game setting
- Mining the necessary materials for the beginning quests or items is very slow, boring, and repetitive; it's so unengaging that it feels like busy work
- Mining laterally is A PAIN at times because the laser eminates from your upper chest and you can't mine a straight line below or above that level due to that constraint - you have to mine extra blocks to get line of sight for your laser (which technically makes sense, but this isn't real life and an arbitration could be made here, even just letting us CROUCH would fix half of the problem)
- Moving the character is clunky, you stop on a dime and using the jetpack arrests upward movement to begin a slow acceleration upward (but using the jetpack to slow your fall does very little to slow you unless you were already falling at a slow speed)
- The npc with dialogue is annoying, makes annoying sounds each time you respond to it, and doesn't help you with the early game much other than telling you what the tutorial pane (accessed with the U key) does.
- Several parts of the game are very arbitrary, like being magically unable to mine in an event area until you complete the event (but then able to mine with no problem afterward)


Conclusion: The game almost has the barebones of a sandbox crafting adventure game, with what looks like a reasonable amount of content added in. But content doesn't make a game, it only adds to it. The base gameplay, the platforming, the item collection and crafting, just feels bad. It does not feel finished.

Cave Story+: The original indie game with new graphics and a handful of extra content including difficulty settings, new characters and a new level cut from the original game because it was apparently too dark (clones of a friendly character who attack you) which makes no sense considering it involves drowning as well as being forced to kill a character who was fed the red flowers (you'll understand if you play it) along with a character who tried to protect his friends and killed them accidentally. Seriously. It also has multiple endings. Undertale: AWESOME game involving SPOILER SPOILER who SPOILERs SPOILER. It's kinda loses half its appeal if you already know the story. Not to say the story is great and the gameplay is bad; all of undertale is fantastic. It's just that the story and gameplay are SO interconnected that spoiling one makes the other not quite have the impact it's supposed to. Also, bring a friend and a tissue or two. Seriously.

The type that get videos dedicated to laughing at the sheer amount of crap that they are. Anyway, hopefully this helped the devs and the people who are thinking about buying it. Here's some games that hold up to the 1$ per hour of fun rule. Terraria: a 157 hour epic, and i've only gotten to late prehardmode and skill is the limiting factor in that. Cave Story+: The original indie game with new graphics and a handful of extra content including difficulty settings, new characters and a new level cut from the original game because it was apparently too dark (clones of a friendly character who attack you) which makes no sense considering it involves drowning as well as being forced to kill a character who was fed the red flowers (you'll understand if you play it) along with a character who tried to protect his friends and killed them accidentally. Seriously. It also has multiple endings. Undertale: AWESOME game involving SPOILER SPOILER who SPOILERs SPOILER. It's kinda loses half its appeal if you already know the story. Not to say the story is great and the gameplay is bad; all of undertale is fantastic. It's just that the story and gameplay are SO interconnected that spoiling one makes the other not quite have the impact it's supposed to. Also, bring a friend and a tissue or two. Seriously. Undertale is the only game ever to make me laugh so hard or cry anything exept tears of frustration."

This game's pretty good and I do recommend it for a good 20 hours of playtime.

Pros:
Scifi setting is nice
Goofy humour is good and prevalent throughout the game if you're into that kind of thing
Game runs smooth for me and I've encountered few bugs since coming out of early access
A lot of different blocks and placeables for building bases
A lot of different items and armours
Dungeons are a lot of fun
Music is great and matches the mood
NPCs that give quests
Easy to fast travel between bases

Cons:
Nothing to really do in the 3rd biome but grind for materials to build end game gear.  Also, there doesn't appear to be a dungeon in the 3rd biome
Light radius is small (spamming torches helps but that's just annoying)
Weapons never really get powerful, even the Death Dealer takes multiple hits on spike balls (personal con, I like to feel powerful when I get to the end of a game)
Still a lot of stuff that feels unfinished (many items share sprites, no dungeon in 3rd biome)
I didn't try multiplayer but it sounds like it takes quite a bit of work to set up a server and to get people to join

They are still working on the game, but at a much slower pace.  I hope they make another game because I have enjoyed Edge of Space for what it is and I would like to see something new using what they have learned developing this game.

I would recommend the game at the stage it is currently at if they sold it as a finished game.

테라리아에 건설과 땅파기가 있다해도 대부분의 게임요소가 RPG에서 끝맺음을 지었다. 하지만 이 게임은 본격적으로 RPG를 위한 땅파기가 되어버렸다. 즉, 무기를 만드는데 보통은 화약과 철 / 에너지를 품은 광석과 두랄루민 등 이런식의 개연성이 있어야 하는데, 
총을 만드려면 흙이 필요하다던가, 음식을 만들려면 유기질이 필요한다던가 등, 
""어쨌든간 무기질""식의 귀차니즘으로 인해, RPG성 짙은 미래 SF 게임에도 불구하고 땅파기 씹노가다가 필수불가결하게 되었다. 진짜로 땅파면 어디서든 무기질이라는 아이템이 나오고, 무기질이라는 아이템 10개로 총을 만든다. 총뿐만이 아니고 다 만든다....

게다가 극초반 게임은 정말 9mm권총 한자루 쥐어주고 ""저그 본기지에서 라이플 한개로 살아남으라는 맹스크""마냥 심각할정도의 어려운 난이도를 보이며 ""극초반의 배려""또한 굉장히 부족하다. 
(반년전에는 조금 더 심했다. 아주 약한 극초반 몬스터 한마리를 잡을때 모든 탄환을 명중시킬경우 약 15~20초가 걸렸다. JRPG로 비유하면 처음 필드에 나가서 사냥하려는데 슬라임 한마리 잡으려니 5분즘 걸린다고 보면 된다. 게다가 본인은 3대즘 맞으면 곧바로 사망. 크리퍼는 느려서 도망이라도 갈 수 있지, 그때의 몹은 메딕앞의 저글링 수준이었다. 게다가 뭐만하면 전부 선공. 그런게 3초마다 맵 양쪽에서 튀어나오고, 그 총을 업그레이드 하려면 한블럭 파는데 2초즘 걸리는 땅을 한참 파고 내려가야 있는 광물을 수십개를 구해야했다. 한국식으로 표현하자면 AMY뒤진게임. 그렇게 살아남아 총을 첫 업그레이드 하려면 한시간즘 걸렸다.)
너무 무거운 움직임과 쓸데없이 높은 케릭터의 크기, 그리고 땅을 파는 속도 또한 다른게임보다 굉장히 답답하다. 어느 게임이나 게임 초반엔 그렇다고는 할 수 있지만, 이 게임은 후반에도 별반 차이는 없으며, 타 샌드박스 어드벤쳐 RPG류 게임은 최소한 그런 움직임을 주고서 땅파기 노가다를 이따위로 많이 시키진 않는다. 메니아들을 위한... 이라는 수식어는 어불성설. 오히려 메니아들을 엿먹이고, 라이트유저에겐 그 엿을 항무운에 끼워주는급의 게임이다.

난이도 조절은 앞으로 해간다면 해결될 일이지만, 이 게임의 중점을 찾기는 힘들것이다. 
마인크래프트는 광물을 위해, 스타바운드는 더 나은 무기와 업그레이드를 위해, 테라리아는 더 강한 적을 위한것이 게임의 중점이라면, 이 게임은 그 모든것이 들어있지만 전부 똥같이 적게들고 애매한 벨런스로 들어있어 게임을 완벽히 망친 게임이다.

만육천원.... 아주 조금의 쓸데없는 DLC를 포함하면 27000원... (사실 지금 있는 DLC가 대체 무슨역할을 하는지 아직도 모르겠다.)
게임이 3천원대 이하로 떨어진다면 한번즘은 경험해볼만 하지만, (로직의 부심을 보면 80%의 파격세일을 기대하기는 힘들다.)
지금의 가격이라면 치킨을 두마리 사먹고 어서 변으로 만들어 흘려보내는것이 조금 더 이득일것이다.

심지어 게임을 키면 제일 먼저 보이는 제일 눈에 띄이는 버튼이 ""우리 매좀 때려줘요!"" 그렇다. 자기 의견을 말해서 열정페이로 아이디어들을 다 토해내라는것이다. 그렇게 만들어진 게임 16000원. 결혼은 하셨는지?
제발...개발이든 개발진이든 좋은방향으로 흘러갔으면 하는 바램이...(이미 돈냈으니)

아, 덧붙히자면 미리 예산투자해준 고마운 얼리엑세스 구매자들에게 빅엿을 날린적이 있다.
예전엔 기본이 지금보다야 쌌겠지만, 스탠다드밖에 없었으며, 지금의 스페셜 에디션은 뭐에쓰는지도 모르겠지만 일단 그때는 없었다. 결국 그때 구매했던 유저들은 지금와서 번들가격차(-11000원)가 아닌 따로 업그레이드를 구매하여 16000원을 더 내야 제대로 즐길 수 있는 셈이다.. 이는 상술의 씹빅엿이고 [strike]진짜 대가리 후려버릴라....  열받네 진짜...[/strike] 
쓰다가 감정이입이 되었지만, 헤비유저일수록 더욱 큰 상처를 안게된 셈이다. [u]선의로 기부를 배풀으니 그 돈 어디서 났냐며 세금 더 내란소리[/u]보다 조금 더 화나는 일. 내 일이 되었으니..
심지어 구매 당시에도 스타바운드처럼 인기가 많고 매우 재밌었다면 얼리엑세스의 취지를 통해 ""미리 하는 값""이라는 점에 대해 이해를 했을지도 모른다. 그러나 위에도 서술했듯이 [strike]아오빡치네진짜[/strike] 그땐 플레이 하기가 ""불가능""에 가까운 수준으로 게임 벨런스가 엉망이었다.

제작사 로직 아니랍니다. 다행이네요. 아마 옛날에 로직에서 콜라보한적이 있어서 착각한듯 합니다. 
한때는 3천원 한적도 있었습니다. 80%던가 세일 때려서... 
애초에 이 게임은 플레이 하는거 자체가 시간 허비를 넘어서서  돈을 받아야 하는급의 게임입니다.  이거 수정하는 순간에 30일 내 추천율이 7%네요. 100명중의 7명이 즐겁다고 한 셈인데,
대충 세디스트와 마조히스트의 비율이 50/50이면, 그중에 인생을 허비하는것에 쾌감을 느끼는 극마조가 7명정도 된다고 생각하시면 됩니다.

제 플레이 타임 보시면 12시간이라고 나와있을텐데, 저 12시간중에서 무기를 2번이상 업글해본적이 단 한번도 없습니다. 옛날과 똑같이 비유하자면, RPG겜에서 시작하자마자 준 ""허름한 나무막대기""를 ""목검""으로 바꾸는데 플레이타임이 12시간이 걸리는거라 보면 됩니다. 최종템이 뭔지, 마왕이 뭔지, 사실 이 겜이 뭘 하는겜인지는 아직까지도 모릅니다.","[b][h1]If you think Terraria and its games are the same genre just because they're from the same company, you're mistaken.[/h1][/b]
Even though Terraria features building and digging, most of its game elements end up in RPG form. However, this game has become a true RPG-focused digging game. In other words, weapon crafting typically requires probable items like gunpowder and iron, or energy-containing ores and duralumin.
But instead, things like making guns requires dirt, or making food requires organic matter.
Due to the ""inorganic matter anyway"" mentality, even in a futuristic sci-fi game with a strong RPG feel, digging has become a necessity. You can find inorganic items everywhere you dig, and you can craft a gun with 10 of them. It's not just guns, they make everything...

Moreover, the very early game is seriously difficult, giving you a single 9mm pistol and telling you to survive in a Zerg base with only a rifle, much like Mengsk, and it's also seriously lacking in ""consideration for the very early game."" (It was a bit worse half a year ago. It took about 15-20 seconds to hit a very weak, very early monster with all the bullets. If I compare it to a JRPG, it would be like going out to the field for the first time and hunting, and it would take about 5 minutes to kill a single slime. On top of that, I would die immediately after getting hit by about 3 times. Creepers are slow, so you can run away, but back then, the monsters were like zerglings in front of a medic. On top of that, everything was preemptive. Those things would pop out from both sides of the map every 3 seconds, and to upgrade that gun, you had to dig a long way down the ground, which took about 2 seconds to dig a block, to get dozens of minerals. To put it in Korean, it was like AMY's game falling behind. It took about an hour to survive and upgrade the gun for the first time.)
The movement was too heavy, the character size was unnecessarily high, and the digging speed was also incredibly frustrating compared to other games. While this can be true in the early stages of any game, this game doesn't differ much in the later stages. Other sandbox adventure RPGs at least offer similar movement and don't force players to dig as much. The phrase ""for hardcore gamers..."" is absurd. This game actually screws hardcore gamers over, while casual players are left with a sense of shame.

Difficulty adjustments will likely be addressed in the future, but it's difficult to pinpoint the game's core focus.

Minecraft focuses on minerals, Starbound on better weapons and upgrades, and Terraria on stronger enemies. This game offers all of these, but with a paltry amount of content and an ambiguous balance, completely ruining the experience.

Sixteen thousand won... Including a tiny bit of useless DLC, it's 27,000 won... (Honestly, I still don't know what the current DLC does.)
If the game were to drop below 3,000 won, it'd be worth a try (though considering Logic's arrogance, it's hard to expect an 80% off sale).

At the current price, it's probably better to buy two chickens and then quickly turn them into poop.

Even the most prominent button you see when you start the game is ""Beat us!"" That's right. It's asking you to voice your opinions and share your ideas with Passion Pay. A game made that way costs 16,000 won. Are you married?
Please... I hope the development team and the developers all go in a good direction... (Since I already paid for it.)

Oh, and by the way, I once gave a big slap to the Early Access purchasers who generously invested in the game. Back then, the basic version might have been cheaper, but only the Standard Edition was available. I don't even know what the current Special Edition is for, but it didn't exist back then. Ultimately, users who purchased it then have to pay an additional 16,000 won for the upgrade, rather than the bundled price difference (-11,000 won). This is a huge sales pitch, and [strike]I'm going to smash your head in... This is so infuriating...[/strike] 
I sympathized with it, but the more heavy users, the more hurt it felt. It's a little more infuriating than [u]someone who donates with good intentions and then asks where the money came from and demands more taxes[/u]. Now that it's my business...
Even if it had been as popular and fun as Starbound at the time of purchase, I might have understood the ""early payment"" aspect of Early Access. However, as I mentioned above, [strike]Ao-pak-chi-ne-jjin-jja[/strike] back then, the game balance was so bad it was nearly ""impossible"" to play.

+ Additional Correction
It's not the developer Logic. Thank goodness. I think I mistook it because Logic collaborated with me a while back.

There was a time when it was 3,000 won. It was on sale for 80% off...

This game is so bad that playing it is not just a waste of time; it's a game that demands money. As of this revision, the 30-day recommendation rate is 7%. That means 7 out of 100 people enjoyed it.
Roughly speaking, if the ratio of sadists to masochists is 50/50, then you can think of it as 7 of those people being extreme masochists who find pleasure in wasting their lives.

If you look at my playtime, it says 12 hours, but in that 12 hours, I never upgraded my weapon more than twice. To use an old-school analogy, it's like changing the ""shabby wooden stick"" you're given at the start of an RPG into a ""wooden sword""—it takes 12 hours of playtime. I still don't know what the final item is, what the Demon King is, or what the actual purpose of this game is."

Você tem arma de munição infinita, você vai craftando com o tempo as armas, tem armas que tem que criar munição. Você ganha XP, uma pontuação no máximo de 10 mil. Quando chega a 10 mil, você usa esses pontos para aumentar objetos para craftar, são várias opções, objetos para base (cama, mesa, luzes, geladeira e etc...). Comestíveis, armaduras, ferramentas de mineração e muitos outros. Diferente de Terraria, Starbound, Craft the World ao qual você tem chão firme e vai longe nele, o Edge of Space são tipo monte de blocos grandes, pequenos, de muitos tamanhos espalhados no ar, você vai voar muito. Já na imagem de fundo do jogo no menu (desktop), você verá um planeta com uma parte dela inteira e a outra despedaçada, ao qual os pedaços indo em direção ao espaço, então no meu entender acho que esses pedaços desse planeta são aqueles pedaços de terra em que você pode explorar, tem menores, minúsculas e bem grande para explorar, mas não conseguir completar um teste em ficar descende, e descendo até achar solo firme em que, se eu fazer um buraco pra chegar no núcleo do planeta,  eu chegue lá para enfrente os monstros que fiquem escondido, não consegui completar isso pra ver se tem esse chão firme como nos jogos padrão de sobrevivência estilo Terraria.

Sua ferramente de mineração não é uma faquinha molada de pedra (Como no Craft the World) ao qual você vai explorando e com os recursos fazer nova ferramente, picareta, machado. Neste jogo você tem uma ferramenta lazer, que queima a matéria, até mais resistente que tiver, ele queima e aparece aquela bolinha da cor da matéria. Para minerar o fundo, pois sempre fica o fundo, aperta a tecla TAB que o lazer vermelho muda para o azul, o lazer azul vai tirando aquele fundo pra ter mais recurso de acordo com o que você tá tirando, pedra, alumínio, terra, etc. As árvores e plantas estranhas você corta elas depois que você craftar uma serra lazer que é infinita, isto é, ela não se desgasta, você vai cortando tudo. Eu acho bacana isso, essas ferramentas serem infinitas.

A Ação do jogo é bom, ainda não fui longe nisso pra enfrentar os chefões, eu fico mais minerando, já criei minha base, aliás, mais uma casinha do que uma base, isso é legal. Há mais coisas para descobrir e pesquisar, mas até então o jogo tem seu potencial, até então não achei ruim o jogo.

Jogo pra mim tem que ter diversão do que gráfico, não dou importância nisso. Mas o jogo com boa diversão eu gosto muito, pois sou do tempo em que jogos não tinham gráfico e sim diversão pura.

Não entendo a análise negativa dos jogadores, alguns dá pra entende, pois o jogo tá tendo atualizações, então estes que deram análise negativa é porque o jogo tava em fase inicial, Alpha ou Beta. Mas nesse momento ele tá bom, e tem grande potencial. O modo cooperativo é aquele ""clássico"", para entrar no servidor do seu amigo você tem que adiciona o IP dele para poder entrar.

Eu recomendo sim esse jogo, ele é bom, eu me divirto nele.

Dá pra criar personagem, ele é um combatente com estilo astronauta, claro, pois é em outro planeta. Vale a pena, eu aconselho a comprar, mas é bom comprar na promoção, claro, quanto mais desconto melhor, compre quando você achar que tá no melhor desconto.","Great game, very good. I think it's better than Terraria, Starbound, and Craft the World for its ease of crafting and good action. You have infinite ammo weapons, which you craft over time, and some weapons require ammunition creation. You earn XP, a maximum score of 10,000. When you reach 10,000, you use these points to upgrade crafting items. There are several options, including base items (bed, table, lights, refrigerator, etc.), food, armor, mining tools, and many others. Unlike Terraria, Starbound, and Craft the World, where you have solid ground and can go far, Edge of Space is a bunch of large, small, and variously sized blocks scattered in the air; you'll fly a lot. In the game's background image on the desktop menu, you'll see a planet with one part intact and the other shattered, with the pieces heading off into space. So, in my opinion, these pieces of this planet are the chunks of land you can explore. There are smaller, tiny, and very large ones to explore, but I couldn't complete a test where I kept descending and descending until I found solid ground where, if I drilled a hole to reach the planet's core, I could get there and face the monsters hiding there. I couldn't complete this test to see if there was solid ground like in standard survival games like Terraria.

Your mining tool isn't a small, sharpened stone knife (like in Craft the World), which you mine and use to make new tools, such as pickaxes and axes, with the resources. In this game, you have a laser tool that burns matter, even the most resistant one you have; it burns, and a little ball the color of the matter appears. To mine the bottom, since the bottom always remains, press the TAB key and the red laser changes to blue. The blue laser removes that bottom to provide more resources depending on what you're extracting: stone, aluminum, earth, etc. You cut down the trees and strange plants after you craft a laser saw, which is infinite; that is, it doesn't wear out; you can cut everything. I think it's cool that these tools are infinite.

The game's action is good. I haven't gotten far enough to face the bosses yet. I mostly mine. I've already created my base—more of a little house than a base, actually—which is cool. There are more things to discover and research, but so far the game has its potential. So far, I haven't found it bad.

For me, a game should be more about fun than graphics; I don't care about that. But I really like games with good fun, because I'm from a time when games didn't have graphics, but were just pure fun.

I don't understand the negative player reviews. Some are understandable, as the game is being updated. Those who gave negative reviews are because the game was in its early stages, Alpha or Beta. But right now, it's good and has great potential. The co-op mode is the ""classic"" one; to join your friend's server, you have to add their IP address.

I do recommend this game; it's good, and I have fun playing it.

You can create a character; he's an astronaut-style fighter, of course, because it's on another planet. It's worth it. I recommend buying it, but it's best to buy it on sale, of course. The bigger the discount, the better. Buy it when you think it's at the best price."
19265200,russian,2015.10.25 16:55,❌,✅,0.4920113683,0,"За 50 часов игры могу с уверенностью сказать, что Edge of Space интереснее чем Terraria  и куда сложнее особенно в крафте.

Плюсы:
1) Огромный, интересный мир.
2) Множество экипироаки, включая экипировку с данжевых ресурсов.
3) Отличный Soundtrack/
4) Постоянно спавняющиеся роботы-машины которые облегчают прохождение игры, Вы можите с его помощью опускаться ниже и убивать сложных монстров тем самым фармя EX вот только подняться уже не сможите с его помощью так, как он не летает.
5) Одной базой, как в Terraria Вам точно не обойтись.
6) Данжи в стиле Tower defence.
7) Есть некие арены которые предсоит зачистить от зомби, крабов, пингвино, желешек или медведей сракетными установками на плечах. И в этих-же аренах можно обустроится не тратя время на постройку хижины.
8) Забавные NPC. В особенности акула со смешным голосом.
9) Множества монстров.

Минусы:
1) Окна инвенторя, крафта, меню жутко тормозят при перемещении их или предметов.
2) Окна огромные и парой занимает весь монитор 22"" если открыть скажим инвентарь и сундук или окно для крафта.
3) Я только к одному боссу смог попасть за все 50 часов и он 100% копия megatron из Terraria. 

На первый взгляд Edge of Space через чур сложная и непонятная, но после 10 часов игры Вы вникните в процесс и она вам понравится. Также добавлю, что большинство пишут обзоры поиграв не более 2х часов и пишут отрицательные. Помню когда купил Edge of Space то через 10 минут вышел и на долго забросил игру, а с пустя год-два поиграв в нее довольно долгое время понял, что не совершил ту самую ошибку и ненаписал отрицательный обзор.

Несоветую покупать! Игра говном осталась, обнов нет!","After 50 hours of play, I can confidently say that Edge of Space is more interesting than Terraria and much more challenging, especially in crafting.

Pros:
1) Huge, interesting world.
2) Lots of equipment, including gear from dungeon resources.
3) Excellent soundtrack.
4) Constantly spawning robotic machines make the game easier. You can use it to descend lower and kill difficult monsters, thereby farming EX, but you won't be able to ascend with it since it doesn't fly.
5) You definitely won't get by with a single base, like in Terraria.
6) Tower defense-style dungeons.
7) There are certain arenas that require you to clear out zombies, crabs, penguins, jellies, or bears using shoulder-mounted rocket launchers. And in these same arenas, you can settle in without wasting time building a hut.
8) Funny NPCs. Especially the shark with the funny voice.
9) Lots of monsters.

Cons:
1) The inventory, crafting, and menu windows are terribly slow when moving them or items. 2) The windows are huge, and a couple take up the entire 22"" monitor when you open, say, the inventory, chest, or crafting window.
3) I only managed to reach one boss in the entire 50 hours, and he's a 100% copy of Megatron from Terraria.

At first glance, Edge of Space is overly difficult and confusing, but after 10 hours of play, you'll get the hang of it and you'll love it. I'll also add that most people write reviews after playing for no more than two hours and write negative ones. I remember when I bought Edge of Space, I quit after 10 minutes and abandoned the game for a long time. After playing for a year or two, I realized I hadn't made the same mistake and written a negative review.

I don't recommend buying it! The game is still crap, and there are no updates!"

Attention, je ne parle pas de la qualité technique ou de la puissance graphique, mais bien de la DA, qui est moche, alors que je trouve Minecraft (et oui, comment ne pas le citer...) très joli.
Ensuite l'ambiance. Pour le coup, avec moi ça a pris. C'est bizarre, un peu comme un bouquin de SF des années 50-60. Spécial, mais pourquoi pas.
Et enfin le jeu, et son gameplay. Je n'ai trouvé aucun nouveauté, mais la prise en main relativement facile (par rapport à d'autres tentatives du genre) et l'arbre de crafting/connaissance m'ont appâtés.

Meh.

Passé les 2 premières de découverte, j'en arrive vite à me dire : ""A quoi bon ?"" Farmer pendant des heures juste pour avancer dans un arbre de connaissance et ""m'amuser"" à crafter le plus d'objets possibles ? Autant dans Minecraft (bigre, encore lui !) ça marche, car la découverte et l'émerveillement sont toujours là, autant sur Edge of Space, ça n'a pas pris. Le plus génant à mon avis c'est le manque d'intérêt perçu du craft en début de jeu. A part quelques améliorations évidentes sur l'équipement, il n'y a pas d'indication sur l'utilité des autres recettes. Au final, passé la découverte, rien ne m'a retenu et les petits défauts ont commencés à me sauter aux yeux. Dans un monde où les jeux du genre n'existeraient pas, j'aurai peut-être insisté plus longtemps et m'y serai plus, mais la concurrence est rude et de qualité, donc aucun intérêt de persévérer.","Yet another survival/exploration game... Why not, I like it. Okay, first point: it's ugly. Mind you, I'm not talking about the technical quality or the graphical power, but rather the art direction, which is ugly, even though I find Minecraft (and yes, how could I not mention it...) very pretty.
Then the atmosphere. For once, it really resonated with me. It's weird, a bit like a sci-fi book from the 50s and 60s. A bit odd, but why not.
And finally, the game and its gameplay. I didn't find anything new, but the relatively easy handling (compared to other attempts in the genre) and the crafting/knowledge tree enticed me.

Meh.

After the first two discovery sessions, I quickly start to think to myself: ""What's the point?"" Farming for hours just to advance in a knowledge tree and ""have fun"" crafting as many items as possible? As much as it works in Minecraft (gosh, him again!), because the discovery and wonder are still there, in Edge of Space, it didn't take off. The most annoying thing in my opinion is the perceived lack of interest in crafting at the beginning of the game. Apart from a few obvious improvements to the equipment, there is no indication of the usefulness of the other recipes. In the end, after the discovery, nothing held me back and the small flaws started to jump out at me. In a world where games of this genre didn't exist, I might have insisted longer and been more involved, but the competition is tough and of high quality, so there is no point in persevering."

Some of the mechanics could be better aswell, for example the mining tool which sometimes seems random in what it actually hits.
The game may have potential but there are still some really annoying bugs. And since you spawn at your spawn again after closing the game, some of the bugs that force you to restart are really annoying and take the fun out of the game.
Due to the frequency of the appearence of the bugs on a Lan server the game is baisically unplayable there, since you cant even finish one dungeon.

Another piece of crap from Steam Early Access, like 90% of the games there. They've sold enough copies that you can just forget about it and pretend you're still working on the game. It's very convenient. Especially after the release of Starbound, the developers screwed up and decided to give up.
The mechanics are flawed, and it's boring to play. But most importantly, the game is a buggy demo. After a couple of hours, the game starts to lag and you have to completely restart it. If the developers couldn't fix such an obvious bug, what can we say about the entire game?
Play for an hour, restart, play for an hour, restart... and it still takes a long time to load.

The release version of the game feels more like a version that should be releasing on to Steam Early Access for the first time, to go through those last few months of finishing, polishing and feedback before actual release. It still feels in a rather ""beta"" state, which is disappointing for a game that's already been in Early Access for two years.

For instance rockets are represented in the player's inventory UI as an ammo type, but there is actually no weapon that requires it, nor any recipe to make it. An unfinished stub of a feature like this shouldn't be left in the release version, it's misleading and cringingly ""beta"".

The biggest flaw with EoS is its glaringly lacking help menus. This is a significant flaw because the opportunities offered by the game far outweigh the amount of helpful information about the different tools and installations you can craft. This can lead to extended periods of aimless mining and construction that can feel pointless and frustratingly anti-climactic (I've been surprised quite often at how little I could accomplish during long hours of continuous play because of a lack of clear objectives).

That being said, I've grown to enjoy Edge of Space very much. Here's a bit of context: you are dropped on a foreign planet after a spaceship crash and evacuation. Your codex (the help menus) is obviously incomplete and written very much like the entries in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: unfocused and essentially devoid of any useful information beyond vague hints at a distant purpose. As the player, it is your job to extrapolate meaning -and ultimately results- from what little help and guidance you are offered by your interplanetary employer.

Edge of Space plays very much like the old NES and SNES Metroid games, with the added elements of terraforming and crafting. The bottom line is that once you've ""figured out"" the basics, the game works. Very well.

So, provided you're willing to tolerate fuzzy objectives and the occasional quirks, you should enjoy Edge of Space for what it is: a wacky, competely over-the-top sandbox with a lot of potential and a ton of fun! And laser sharks!

In it's current (release) state, the game is tolerable, but lacking in many respects still, the largest being actually fun. I only play games of this sort multiplayer, so the experience may be different for playing solo.

The mining tool is my biggest gripe. It fires in a line, that is based on an unusual place on your character, making getting at specific tiles difficult, and hard to aim at anything but straight up/down/left/right. The mining tool is INCREDIBLY slow compared to other games such as Terraria or Starbound. In the latest incarnation, they added new mining tools that slowly (at about half-speed) dig out the tiles around the tile it's hitting, but generally this doesn't help much because it's slower and you can't generally dig in a way to take much advantage of it.

Then there is dealing with the plants of the world, which require a saw of some sort to gather. This is even slower than the mining tool, you just sit and wait and wait for it. And finally get your 2 protovine or whatnot. Good luck finding any seeds!

And then creating much of anything requires so many resources, but you have a tiny inventory and finding storage is time consuming. And though it is an interesting idea to have tiers of what sort of item something is (eg, ""Inorganic - Mineral - Radioactive - Uranium""), when you need to build something that just needs a mineral, it should just say ""Uranium"" or similar names... but it has the entire long list for Uranium, making it hard to tell exactly what it is you need without really long names for things.

And the world itself is just a bunch of skylands, with occasional larger ones tossed in there for actual ""ground"", except that when you get lower, you have another giant gap of space before getting to the next ""tier"" of skyland below you. You generally find out about that after having walked off a cliff of your ""ground"" near the beginning of the game, because it is very abrupt: ""Just walking along, oh there's a little hill, let's hop down... no, there's no bottom. NO! Oh, I'm dead again...""

The game USED to have an entire tutorial, teaching you how to use the interface, move around, use the laser pick, etc. but the release version removed all of that in favor of a talking shark that just tells you to get it things... without any details on how to do much of anything. I'm glad I already knew how to switch between foreground and background tile mining/placement from the previous tutorial, because I probably would have gone nuts trying to figure it out.

There are now side missions that take you to your own personal instance that are not multiplayer at that point... there are random NPCs to get that don't do much (a couple give you ok-ish rewards for doing tasks)... there are various weapons, but most require ammo that is frustrating to get.

Above all things, am I the only one who felt EoS is somewhat like Terraria+Windforge ?


I haven't played Early Access version, so I don't know how it got better.

I played EoS from v1.0 (on my friend's), thought it was still on beta since it was quite buggy and stuttering like 100's hrs played good old  mega-modded Baldur's Gate Trilogy (if you played old BG hundreds hours, you know what I mean). However, it was playable, so I consumed all the contents available in less than 15hrs on single player (only friend having EoS was the one I was playing on that time). I felt like there're still some unfinished works.

Few days back, heard EoS is ver1.05 now, I purchased it for myself hoping thing getting better, started new game on single player. Yeah, I had to admit that it is little bit better than v1.0, yet it's still buggy and has UI lagging problem. Therefore, I have to say I am pretty disappointed so far.

Of course, it's possible the dev's gonna update some contents and fix all those annoying glitches, and EoS do have lots of potential as Windforge had (and it disappointed me a lot). However, all I can say so far is, if this is what becomes as ""released"" after long time of ""early access,"" nope, not yet. You need li'l bit more work.

I was sick of Early-access Starbound got lost its own way, and hoping EoS does not complete itself soon.

In conclusion, I won't recomment EoS yet. If you are considering about purchasing it, I'd say wait a bit longer, and see how the updates go.",

It's still the confusing heap of garbage it was a year ago. The dev's seem to have abandoned this game. The game still feels like it's in an Alpha stage. It's choppy, the sprites are glitchy at times, and the amount of work you need to do to be able to get anything, it's outrageously difficult.

I had been an avid Minecraft and Terraria player, having LAN parties with my friends. We had beaten Minecraft, and had beaten all the regular bosses in Terraria. Then, one of them found this game. It looked cool, so we bought the game, and ran it. 5-7 hours in, and we still have the basic tools. None of us could figure out how to upgrade them, or get new tools! All the crafting involved electrical gates the technicians use!! We ended up abandoning the game, and never spoke of it again.

So, unless you're a senior technician that knows electrical gates by heart, don't waste the $15 on this game.

On another note: Terraria is about 250 mb. Edge of Space of a little over 2 Gb. Terraria has hours upon hours, upon hours of gameplay, with lots of replayability, and an active online community. Edge of Space has very little content, very little to no online presence, and actually very hard to set-up a server for. Hmm, I wonder what the better choice is....

If you don't know what Terraria is, and just found this game by surprise, get Terraria.

---EDIT---

So, another year has passed, and my friends decide to check this game out again. From what I've seen, and remember of this game, it has defintely changed, for the better. The crafting is easier to understand, the leveling up system, albeit a bit demanding and stops gameplay, is pretty interesting. The gunplay is great, the mining system could use a bit of work, and the UI is still pretty bad with my only issue being that every individual thing, such as inventory, crafting, skills, etc., requires a different button to press in order for that specific menu to come up(how hard could it have been for it to just open up with one button, and have different tabs for everything?).

Me and my friends played this for about 5 hours straight, and we all said that it is definitely fun. Though there are still issues, the game is in a playable state. But... I don't think mutch will change in the future, unless these developers are secretly working on this without giving updates, as the last form of any game update was last year(April 28th 2015, if I remember correctly), while the last time a dev spoke about the game(on steam at least), was 2 months ago(April 25th). The post said that they were sorry for being silent about the game, and that logistical issues came about, and that they would get back to the playerbase and explain what was happening. Well, it's been 2 months. Where's the explanation?


tl;dr
In the state this game is in currently, I still wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Unless you have a group of friends to play with, know how to portforward(because Hamachi doesn't work), and have some extra money laying around, then don't buy this game. It still seems like the developers have abandon this game, or don't have a whole lot of motivation for it.

Edge of Space has very little content, very little to no online presence, and actually very hard to set-up a server for. Hmm, I wonder what the better choice is....

If you don't know what Terraria is, and just found this game by surprise, get Terraria.

---EDIT---

So, another year has passed, and my friends decide to check this game out again. From what I've seen, and remember of this game, it has defintely changed, for the better. The crafting is easier to understand, the leveling up system, albeit a bit demanding and stops gameplay, is pretty interesting. The gunplay is great, the mining system could use a bit of work, and the UI is still pretty bad with my only issue being that every individual thing, such as inventory, crafting, skills, etc., requires a different button to press in order for that specific menu to come up(how hard could it have been for it to just open up with one button, and have different tabs for everything?).

Me and my friends played this for about 5 hours straight, and we all said that it is definitely fun. Though there are still issues, the game is in a playable state. But... I don't think mutch will change in the future, unless these developers are secretly working on this without giving updates, as the last form of any game update was last year(April 28th 2015, if I remember correctly), while the last time a dev spoke about the game(on steam at least), was 2 months ago(April 25th). The post said that they were sorry for being silent about the game, and that logistical issues came about, and that they would get back to the playerbase and explain what was happening. Well, it's been 2 months. Where's the explanation?


tl;dr
In the state this game is in currently, I still wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Unless you have a group of friends to play with, know how to portforward(because Hamachi doesn't work), and have some extra money laying around, then don't buy this game. It still seems like the developers have abandon this game, or don't have a whole lot of motivation for it.







I would still rather play Terraria."

The sheer variety of weapons, deployables, pets, mounts, materials, dungeons, bosses etc is impressive, and although there are some obvious similarities to Terraria for instance, it is in fact a very different game. I would definitely recommend trying to find someone else who you can play with though, as it does enhance the experience a lot.

There is a sort of tutorial in the form of a friendly laser shark who asks you to do a few short quests to get you used to the basic mechanics of the game, but the rest is mostly left up to you to figure out, (there are instructions on how to do everything if you dig in the menu) and so a degree of effort is required in order to get into the real meat of the content. Once you do however, you'll realise just how much there is to do and discover.

Edge of space is very colourful and is graphically the equivalent of eating too many packets of Skittles in one sitting, the pallette is well chosen and easy on the eye, the art style is great, and everything stands out. Some players have complained about the lighting system but personally I haven't had any problems with it. 

The music is great, very relaxing and suits the mood well. The best thing however is the splendidly warped sense of humour that the developers obviously have and that comes across not only in the design of the world but in many of the descriptions and explanations that are there to be read if you take the time (and I recommend that you do)

Gameplay is a lot of fun and some of the weapons in particular are extremely satisfying to use. I know I have only just started to scratch the surface but already I am enjoying flying around on a net full of jellyfish with a small glowing fox creature following me around and helping to light my journey into the planet's extensive cave systems.

In summary, if you like randomly generated 2D exploration games with crazy amounts of content and are willing to put in the time and effort required to get through the initial learning stages, then you will get very good value from Edge of space, even more if you can find someone else to team up with.","Those who are willing to put in the time to explore the world of Edge of space will find a colossal amount of content just waiting to be discovered and enjoyed.

I have been playing the game since beta. Overall it has been a positive experience for me. Playing version 1 was a big surprise. They added a ton of stuff. Personally I get sick of all the wizzard and warrior stuff so I love the fact that this is in space. Definetely has the Metroid feel you hear others talk about. Sound track is wicked, great art style! Starbound is in space but for some reason that game never keeps my attention like Edge of Space and Terraria. I have a ton of the open-world sandbox build, survive games. Like, A LOT of them. This game is one of my favorites.

I really enjoy what you have created here. Great job! I get burned here and there by early access but am super happy that you guys got to version 1. Looking forward to all the great updates to come.","[h1]Abandoned Game That I Love[/h1]

Being a follower via Early Access; I must say that this game has come a long way in its development, and I am quite happy with the launch result. The game runs smooth, the 2D graphics are amazing; I definitely love how the developers broke away from the typical pixel art you see in most games of the genre. What definitely makes me appreciate this game, is not only the quality of the visuals and the sound; but what makes it different from other games like Starbound or Terraria. That being said, it has its drawbacks; which are mainly peeves on mine as mentioned in the cons section.

Pros:
+ Exceptional 2D artwork and visuals, definitely shines brighter than others of its genre.
+ Nice and fitting contemporary Sci-fi theme.
+ Biome diversity and abundance of interesting places to explore.
+ The PIOS system which allows you to wire power to objects.
+ Technology tree and research aspects are present.
+ Nice crafting system. 

Uncertain:
= The game feels grindy, but at the same time it prolongs the game.

Cons:
- The NPC's you get are really lame. You have a flying shark that sounds like a 5 year old, and a bunch of annoying furry ""aliens"". Really devs, couldn't you be more creative and make up some interesting sentient alien species?
- Sometimes, there is an excessive amount of creature spawns. 
- Some creatures have a very obnoxious knockback.
- There needs to be more biomes/content.

Overall: If you like these kind of open-world, randomly generated 2D platform games; this is definitely for you.","REVISED 11/4/2015

Bom, tentar avaliar o jogo em sua (finalmente), fase de lançamento, ate o momento estou curtindo muito o jogo. Esta completamente diferente de sua fase beta nas opções de abrir novas receitas e armamentos.

O mapa na verdade e um planeta que toda vez que se cria um novo, ele muda características, então muito difícil encontrar dois iguais, pois os minérios, tuneis, e relevos sempre estarão em posições e em diferentes locais. E também tem as ""mini-bases de criaturas"" que devem ser conquistadas dando mais vontade de explorar o mapa. Gostei da opção de recrutar npcs para lhe ajudar.

E a dificuldade aumenta conforme descer, mas não esqueça de verificar se sua armadura irá suportar a pressão atmosférica e a radiação.

A jogabilidade e boa, controles são simples, sem muitos segredos e fáceis de utilizar e memorizar. E com a possibilidade de jogar com os amigos e muito divertido sair caçando os minérios e recursos, e fazer as Dungeons.

O sistema de Craft e bem variado, e com varias opções de armamentos, armaduras para situações diferentes (exploração, combate, mineração), enfeites para sua base, vários tipos de ""tijolos"" para construir, e ainda tem muito mais conforme pega upgrades novos, montarias e pets para atender sua necessidade seja para te auxiliar no combate (te dando mais defesas ou te ajudando a atirar), exploração (Luz ou proteção radioativa) ou mineração (ajudando a minerar ou localizando minérios). Ate o momento vi que habilita crafts avançados usando a EXP que se acumula, mas tem algumas opções de construção que se habilita conforme vai conquistando o ""nível"" que esta no planeta.

As Dungeons são legais mas são poucas ate o momento, são ótimas para pegar recursos raros e farmar EXP para habilitar os crafts e é claro matar o BOSS. Fora isso não há muito o que falar

A historia do jogo eu achei simples mas boa, mas tomara que eles implementem mais detalhes.

Algumas conquistas para se fazer, eu achei meio absurdas.

A musica eu gostei que se adaptou ao clima do jogo, os efeitos sonoros falta melhorar a distribuição R/L sound para Stereo pois parecia que estava jogando em mono.

O suporte dos DEVs do jogo tem se mostrado muito atenciosos,prestativos e amigáveis, para resolver os problemas que o jogo tem desde que os players lembre-se de avisar dos bugs.

Em resumo e um bom jogo, com que pude observar na sua versão final que há espaços vazios e vagos deixando em aberto futuras atualizações com mais dungeons, inimigos e crafts(tomara que sim). Possui um excelente potencial para ser um excelente jogo. Ate o momento o jogo possui alguns bugs que estão sempre sendo atualizados para corrigir. O preço da versão Standard está muito bom, da versão Special já não digo isto.

Finalizando: Jogo muito divertido, mas jogando solo depois de algum tempo se torna tedioso (mas pelo menos irá querer chegar nos melhores crafts do jogo), com amigos a diversão e muito alta e duradoura.",

Though the developers have released this from Early Access, it really should not have been.  First off, the bugs:

 [*] constant shaking of the screen when left unattended for long enough (in my case, once to answer a phone call and another to deal with a someone at the door).

Beyond the bugs, the content of the game itself is surprisingly sparse.  You just constantly descend without much incentive to explore other than to discover upgrade stations.  You can also find NPCs and get their subquests, but even if those subquests aren't broken there's no real payoff for completing them.

At its current level, the amount of active development and polish needed before this would be worthwhile is probably measured in months, not days or weeks.  I'd check back in six months to a year to see if things have gotten better or if the move out of Early Access is an indication that the dev team is abandoning the game and so might as well call it done.","For version 1.0.3

Beyond the bugs, the content of the game itself is surprisingly sparse.  You just constantly descend without much incentive to explore other than to discover upgrade stations.  You can also find NPCs and get their subquests, but even if those subquests aren't broken there's no real payoff for completing them.

At its current level, the amount of active development and polish needed before this would be worthwhile is probably measured in months, not days or weeks.  I'd check back in six months to a year to see if things have gotten better or if the move out of Early Access is an indication that the dev team is abandoning the game and so might as well call it done."

Pros:

Sci-fi setting with a good intro video explaining why you are on a planet that’s hostile and heck bent on killing you.

I love the sci-fi graphics, and the look of the broken planet landscape.

Excellent array of items to craft, in fact, the list is HUGE, including three different sets of armor (each with their own upgrade tree), all kinds of different weapon types, and a lot of other things that give my love of farming resources, and collecting new, interesting bits and pieces, a lot of reasons to feel content.

A very large selection of base building decorations, workstations, defenses, etc. And yes, the advanced items require extensive farming and playing the game to gather enough resources to make, which some might feel is grindy, but I feel motivates me to keep exploring and mining for “a few more minutes” and then turns out to be two-three hours of game time I didn’t even know slipped by when I glance at the clock.

I’ve heard a lot of negatives about the user interface, but personally I see nothing wrong with it, and you can see it demonstrated in action via screen-shots, youtube videos, and streams, so it’s not like the developers are trying to hide something… If it doesn’t interfere with my game-play and fun, I don’t see how it’s a problem.

Lots of biomes, and mobbies, and some good humorous moments.

Tons of new areas to explore, and lots to keep you busy.

Developers that are getting the kinks worked out as fast as possible, and they are very active and responsive in the forums begging those with issues to send them logs so they can fix any issues for everybody else.

I’ve put a ton of time in and I am thoroughly enjoying myself, because I find the game both extensive and challenging.

I myself haven’t crashed even once, and though I experience lag here and there it only happens for me after playing for several hours straight. My computer is an Asus Rog Gaming Laptop, win 10, and I have an nvidia card.

The mini patches since 1.0 hit have improved the game a lot, in my opinion.

Active Devs that really want this game to succeed and are willing to do whatever it takes — though they get knocked around a lot by players that seem unwilling to give them time to hear and fix any issues that might be present…

Cons:

The Lead Dev has said the game was designed more for multiplayer, so mobs tend to spawn in waves that can overwhelm a single playing character… After reading that bit of info, I was sad, because I look at these games as something I wish to spend a lot of time with soloing. Like in Terraria when I played with a friend he wanted to kill this boss, and that boss, and I wanted to just find resources. I never played with anyone again, though once I got to Moon Lord I lost interest, because I realized that fight wasn’t balanced for single player at all (my opinion).

EOS needs some patches to iron out the kinks, and I bet my life SO WILL Terraria Otherworld when it’s released. Even Terraria has had at least a half dozen mini patches since 1.3 hit, and I don’t see anyone knocking Terraria for it… And Starbound will continue to see many updates and patches before and after its 1.0 version hits… Whenever that might happen — sooner than later, me hopes!

Players rush to leave negative feedback, rather than logging the problem and helping the Devs get a handle on it. They have asked and asked for player input via logs, but some grumpy, unhelpful players would rather sink their chance at sales than help get the game working perfectly for everyone.

The game is extensive and resource gathering takes a long, long time. And some ingredients are very hard to find and farm — like Penguin parts and even Headhunter parts, and though I love to farm resources, even I wish these dropped more often…

Sometimes things feel unfair, unbalanced, such as weapon upgrades that don’t do much to make you feel like the mobbies are being hurt… I swear there was a penguin laughing at me at a Penguin Rave — it was hysterical, this little penguin dancing at a Rave as I’m shooting him, pew pew for half a minute…

It seems New Players find the beginning confusing, and perhaps because the game is so extensive more time should have been put into a longer, more engaging tutorial, with an option to skip it for more advanced players…

Final thoughts:

Personally I’m enjoying my time in the game, and though I have a large library, it keeps pulling me back with that one more node feeling, and I wake up excited to play and find new areas and new upgrades, etc. Some might not like gathering, farming games, and if the game is balanced around MP, I think MP should have been a bigger priority, as I believe a lot of complaints have stemmed from the MP community, AND I feel us solo players might not find the game as satisfying in the later stages, if the game really cannot be completed single player (which I’ve no idea if it can or cannot, but I’m hoping!!!)","After extensive playing of Edge of Space since the release I decided to rewrite my review.

Some history:
Game offered some cool features when it came out. Felt like Terraria on space steroids. However it quickly became apparent that the developers were missing some pieces to the puzzle for creating the whole game experience, as they were experimenting with different formulas that became more and more restrictive and further from the initial impression I got when I first played.

Oxygen Not Included seems to have a much better formula (I watched my friend play it yesterday and it was fun even to watch).

I was initially strongly attracted to Edge of Space because it offered much better movement and maneuvering than Terraria, which is honestly a fairly grindy endeavor to play through with fresh characters.

Acho que aquele que procura algo como Edge of Space é por ter um passado em Terraria e um presente em Starbound. E sinceramente eu digo que o ponto forte em Edge of Space é o combate. É meio old-school e bem desafiante. E é bem por isso que vou recomenda-lo. Abaixo alguns prós e contras.

p- Removeram aquele início chato de dentro da Nave - finalmente.
p- Adicionaram quests, instâncias, eventos e conversação com NPCs.
p- O planeta agora é melhor estruturado.
p- Bastante coisa pra criar e os custos do craft são bem justos. 
p- O lance do aprendizado (XP de ciência) é bem interessante.
p- Quanto ao combate, a tela pode ficar facilmente forrada de inimigos - o que é meio esquisito - mas a gigantesca variedade de armas e equipamentos até que compensa pela esquisitisse do spawn.

c - O jogo não parece estar muito otimizado... Meu PC está superaquecendo logo em 20 minutos de jogo. É um AMD FX - esquenta mesmo - mas o estranho é que com jogos como Starbound ou até mesmo Medieval/Space Enginners eu não sofro com aquecimento assim.
c - Ainda existem bugs sérios como ficar preso em tiles indestrutíveis.
c - Texto de alguns itens não faz o menor sentido.

I think those looking for something like Edge of Space are looking for something that has a Terraria past and a Starbound present. And honestly, I'd say that Edge of Space's strong point is the combat. It's kind of old-school and quite challenging. And that's exactly why I'm recommending it. Below are some pros and cons.

p- They removed that annoying in-the-ship start - finally.
p- They added quests, instances, events, and conversation with NPCs.
p- The planet is now better structured.
p- Plenty of things to craft, and the crafting costs are very fair.
p- The learning aspect (science XP) is quite interesting.
p- As for combat, the screen can easily become overrun with enemies - which is a bit weird - but the huge variety of weapons and equipment more than makes up for the odd spawn.

c - The game doesn't seem very optimized... My PC is overheating after just 20 minutes of gameplay. It's an AMD FX - it really gets hot - but the strange thing is that with games like Starbound or even Medieval/Space Engineers, I don't experience this much heat.
c - There are still serious bugs like getting stuck on indestructible tiles.

Zunächst durch die Vielzahl der negativen Reviews abgehalten, habe ich mich dennoch entschlossen, ""Edge of Space"" zu kaufen, da ich diese Art von Spiel mag. Natürlich habe ich auch Terraria und Starbound gespielt und Vieles ist sehr, sehr ähnlich zu den beiden.
Und dennoch geht EoS auch seinen eigenen Weg, auch wenn es nicht bugfrei und eher einsteigerfeindlich ist. Aber ich mag es, wenn einem nicht alles auf dem Silbertablett serviert wird. Zudem: EoS ist gut spielbar. Ich habe noch keinen einzigen Absturz erlebt und auch keinen Bug, der mich am Weiterspielen gehindert hätte.
Ich hoffe auch darauf, dass die Devs am Ball bleiben, Fehler ausmerzen und vielleicht die eine oder andere fehlende Komfortfunktion einbauen.

Für mich ist EoS auf jeden Fall einem positive Überraschung. Ich bereue den Kauf nicht und bin der Meinung, dass die Entwickler bisher eine gute Arbeit geleistet haben. Deshalb von mir 8/10 Punkte!

PS: Trotz recht vieler negativer Reviews gehört EoS nicht zu den vorhandenen faulen Eiern, bei denen  die Devs entweder unfähig oder Abzocker oder Ähnliches sind. Und ich empfinde es als ärgerlich, wenn diese einem regelmäßig zum Kauf angeboten werden.","After playing for about 27 hours, I'd like to share my opinion:

Initially put off by the multitude of negative reviews, I decided to buy ""Edge of Space"" anyway, as I enjoy this kind of game. Of course, I've also played Terraria and Starbound, and many things are very similar to both.
And yet, EoS also forges its own path, even if it's not bug-free and rather unfriendly for beginners. But I like it when everything isn't handed to you on a silver platter. Furthermore, EoS is playable. I haven't experienced a single crash yet, nor have I encountered a single bug that has prevented me from continuing to play.
I also hope the developers keep at it, eliminate bugs, and perhaps add one or two missing convenience features.

For me, EoS is definitely a pleasant surprise. I don't regret the purchase and I think the developers have done a good job so far. Therefore, I give it 8/10!

PS: Despite quite a few negative reviews, EoS isn't one of those bad eggs where the developers are either incompetent or rip-offs or something similar. And I find it annoying when these are regularly offered for sale."

- Vast world (The first biome can easily as big as, if not bigger than, a Large map in Terraria);
- Various quests, both main and side;
- Interesting mechanism, both leveling and crafting;
- Good sound effects;
- Neat 2D graphic;

DOWN points:
- Bugs. Bugs! BUGS! There are a lot of bug fixes needed.
- The menu is not actually scaled with windows' dimensions (i.e. you cannot create new character in 800x600, in-game UI is partly of screen, etc.);
- The whole world is loaded in Unity so it will greatly drop you FPS on low-end PC;
- Character control is poorly built: the character's arm is like a stick attached to the body, it cannot bend so it is really awkward in close-ranged action;
- THERE IS NO HORIZONTAL INERTIA! There is vertical onertia, which mean it take time for you to speed up and slow down vertically. Horizontal: Nope. If you jetpack around and suddenly stop midair, you will drop straight down regardless of the initial speed.

Разрабы нарубили денег и забросили игру - эта проблема всего раннего доступа... сообщество доверилось разрабу, а разраб не имеет обязательств т.к. в целом профит уже нарублен.

Оставлю свой наивный ранний обзор:
Игра была куплена еще когда была в раннем доступе (2014), в то время игра была настолько ""сырой"" что между текстурок можно было рассмотреть куски исходного кода. Спустя год разработки, игра вышла из статуса ""ранний доступ"", однако на данный момент мало что изменилось. А багов стало настолько много, что разработчики должны предоставлять игрокам исходный код, чтобы те могли доделывать игру по мере нахождения багов.

Текущее положение дел такое:

Плюсы:
+ Оригинальная концепция прогресса (биомы по сложности идут сверху-вниз)
+ Данжи
+ Наличие мультиплеера
+ наличие элементов РПГ

Минусы:
- Недостаток контента (вам придется приложить усилия чтобы придумать чем заняться)
- Обилие багов, достойное статуса ""альфа-тест""
- Баги в мультиплеере
- Баги в данжах
- На текущем этапе РПГ система представляет собой тупой гринд
- Очень редкие обновления (разработчики делают игру очень не спеша)

Ставлю игре положительный отзыв потому что есть неплохой потенциал, надеюсь разработчики ее не забросят, и тогда появится очередной достойный сендбокс.","Well, the game's initial positive review didn't live up to expectations. The developers made a killing and then abandoned the game—that's the problem with Early Access... the community trusted the developer, but the developer has no obligations because the profits have already been made.

I'll leave my naive early review:
I bought the game back when it was in Early Access (2014), when it was so raw that you could see chunks of the source code between the textures. After a year of development, the game left Early Access, but little has changed. And the bugs have become so numerous that the developers are obliged to provide players with the source code so they can finish the game as they find them.

The current state of affairs is as follows:

Pros:
+ Original progression concept (biomes increase in difficulty from top to bottom)
+ Dungeons
+ Multiplayer available
+ RPG elements

Cons:
- Lack of content (you'll have to work hard to find something to do)
- Numerous bugs, worthy of alpha test status
- Bugs in multiplayer
- Bugs in dungeons
- At the current stage of the RPG system, it's a grind
- Very infrequent updates (the developers are taking their time making the game)

I'm giving the game a positive review because it has good potential. I hope the developers don't abandon it, and then another decent sandbox game will appear."

18137170,russian,2015.08.22 00:53,❌,✅,0.6499128342,28,"Так случилось, что я люблю песочницы. Если попадает в руки что-то такое, где можно свободно исследовать мир, добывать ресурсы, строить коробки из грязи и вообще вести себя как угодно, я отправляюсь туда надолго. В этот раз вышло иначе. Копал не очень глубоко, исследовал не сильно далеко, и в игре провел около 15 часов. О причинах этого и решил написать.
Игра страшна, как космослизень внутри твоего скафандра, и настолько же сыра. В ней все еще практически нет вещей, которые нужно искать и добывать, зато появилась масса мини-биомов, в которых мы должны вроде как развлекаться, и куча неписей, с которыми можно поговорить и повыполнять за них квесты. Также наш герой не стоит на месте в техническом плане - за экспу он постигает основы космостроения и учится создавать новые предметы. И все бы хорошо, но...
Игра, в которой одной из основных задач - добыча ресурсов, должна создать условия для копки. Здесь же копать особо нечего - несколько видов металлов, несколько видов радиоактивных/биологических ископаемых, при этом редких нет вовсе. Добыча растительных ресурсов проста и незатейлива, их можно регулярно встретить на одних и тех же полях, и даже от базы никуда уходить не надо. В итоге копка очень занудна, потому что не нужно ничего искать, нет ощущения, что ты вообще что-то получаешь (ведь ресурсов редких нет), и большую часть времени ты просто смотришь, как оно отколупывается от стен и потолков. Игра довольно сырая, поэтому нас также ждут застревания головой в потолке и увлекательные поиски угла, под которым можно выкопаться из этого положения.
Разнообразить процесс должны интересные места, в которых мы выполняем задания. Это может быть защитная платформа, терраформер, пещера с зомби, пещера с крабами, пещера с медузами, пещера с летающими головами... да, тут очень много однообразных пещер, в которых мы уничтожаем гнёзда, а потом щелкаем там, где уничтожили гнёзда, выключатели. И всё красиво взрывается. За это, правда, ничего не дают, поэтому большая часть таких мини-биомов не только скучновата, но и бесполезна.
Также добавили несколько данжей. В данже нас ждет разветвленная система комнат, в одной из которых нас поджидает босс. Задумка неплохая, однако из-за плохо прописанной игровой механики мы получаем странную картину. Вот игрок прибыл в свой первый данж и, зачищая комнаты, без проблем дошёл до босса. Внезапно оказывается, что победить босса практически нереально, потому что лучшим оружием, которое в этот момент может быть у игрока, его убить нельзя, боезапас слишком мал (да-да, если аккуратно выпустить в босса все ракеты, а также пули из дробовика и винтовки, которые может носить с собой игрок, босс не потеряет и половины здоровья). В итоге из кармана достается слабенький бластер с неограниченным боезапасом, и нас ждет около восьми минут тупо стрельбы в упор. Но стоять и ждать, пока его расстреляют, босс отказывается. В общем, его нельзя победить игровыми методами без абьюза механики. Теоретически можно улучшить оружие и броню с помощью материалов, найденных в самом данже, но сундуки его в основном набиты повсеместно встречающейся дрянью, тогда как уникальный ресурс данжа, с помощью которого делается обмундирование следующей ступени, так редок, что до босса запросто можно дойти, не набрав его даже на шлем от скафандра. В итоге данж придется проходить много-много раз. Игра сыровата, потому возможны также неприятные глюки в виде, скажем, неоткрывающейся двери после босса, а поведение самого босса однофазово.
И, наконец, нам предлагают выполнение квестов. В наших скитаниях мы встретимся с кучей интересных личностей, которые поселятся у нас на базе и будут давать нам задания. К сожалению, задания эти в основном касаются сбора ресурсов, которые, как я писал выше, встречаются очень часто. Поэтому  обычно вы просто тащите непися на базу и берете-сдаете ему все его квесты, потому что ресурсы у вас уже есть. Исключения бывают, но довольно редко.
Чем же в итоге заняться в Edge of Space? Я расскажу вам. Поскольку игра распространяется через стим, вы можете повыполнять увлекательные ачивки. Например, нужно подпрыгнуть миллион раз и выкопать миллион тайлов. Если одновременно прыгать и копать, а более ничем не заниматься, на это у вас уйдет по приблизительным подсчетам около 10 суток игры. К сожалению, именно это и будет самой увлекательной ее частью, потому что остальные процессы так же монотонны и скучны, но за них вам и вовсе ничего не дадут.","It just so happens that I love sandboxes. If I get my hands on something that lets you freely explore the world, mine resources, build boxes out of dirt, and generally do whatever you want, I'm in for a long time. This time, things were different. I didn't dig very deep, didn't explore very far, and spent about 15 hours in the game. I decided to write about the reasons for this.
The game is as scary as a space slug inside your spacesuit, and just as raw. There are still practically no things to find and mine, but there are now a ton of mini-biomes where we're supposed to have fun, and a bunch of NPCs with whom we can talk and complete quests for them. Our hero is also making progress technically—he uses XP to learn the basics of spacecraft and learn to craft new items. And everything would be fine, except...
A game in which one of the main tasks is resource mining must create conditions for mining. There's not much to dig here—a few types of metals, a few types of radioactive/biological minerals, and no rare ones at all. Extracting plant resources is simple and straightforward; they can be regularly found in the same fields, and you don't even have to leave the base. Ultimately, digging is very tedious because you don't have to search for anything, there's no sense of actually getting anything (since there are no rare resources), and most of the time you just watch things peel off from walls and ceilings. The game is quite crude, so we can also expect to get our heads stuck in the ceiling and have a fascinating search for an angle at which to dig out.
Interesting locations where we complete tasks should add variety to the process. It could be a defensive platform, a terraformer, a cave with zombies, a cave with crabs, a cave with jellyfish, a cave with floating heads... yes, there are a lot of monotonous caves where we destroy nests and then click switches where we destroyed them. And everything explodes beautifully. There's no reward for this, though, so most of these mini-biomes are not only boring but also useless.
They've also added several dungeons. The dungeon features a branching system of rooms, one of which contains a boss. The concept is good, but the poorly written gameplay mechanics create a strange scene. The player arrives at their first dungeon and, clearing rooms, reaches the boss without any problems. Suddenly, defeating the boss becomes practically impossible, as the best weapon the player has at that moment can't kill it, and its ammunition is too low (yes, even if you carefully fire every rocket, shotgun, and rifle bullet the player can carry at the boss, it won't even lose half its health). Ultimately, a weak blaster with unlimited ammunition is pulled from your pocket, and about eight minutes of point-blank shooting awaits. But the boss refuses to stand and wait to be shot. Basically, it's impossible to defeat it using gameplay methods without abusing mechanics. Theoretically, you can upgrade your weapons and armor with materials found in the dungeon itself, but its chests are mostly filled with ubiquitous junk, while the dungeon's unique resource for crafting next-level gear is so rare that you can easily reach the boss without even having enough for a spacesuit helmet. Ultimately, you'll have to play through the dungeon many, many times. The game is still in its infancy, so there are also potential for annoying glitches, like a door not opening after a boss, and the boss's behavior is single-phase.
And finally, we're offered quests. During our wanderings, we'll meet a bunch of interesting characters who will settle in our base and give us tasks. Unfortunately, these tasks mostly involve gathering resources, which, as I mentioned above, are very common. So, usually, you just drag the NPCs back to the base and turn in all their quests, since you already have the resources. Exceptions do exist, but they're rare.
So, what's the ultimate goal in Edge of Space? I'll tell you. Since the game is distributed via Steam, you can earn exciting achievements. For example, you need to jump a million times and dig a million tiles. If you jump and dig at the same time, and do nothing else, it will take you roughly 10 days of play. Unfortunately, this will be the most engaging part, because the rest of the process is just as monotonous and boring, and you won't get anything for it."

In terms of the knowledge progression I'm about 6% complete or so it says. I can say confidently enough that the game is interesting and has some decent mechanics that set it apart from similar games like Terraria and Starbound.

However, this game is very much a buggy mess right now and I would not say this is worthy to be called V1.0, it is very much still an early access game in my mind and if you are hoping to play this game without upset, I feel I need to tell you that you will be let down.

-Mining
Mining feels clunky at the best of times, it doesn't work like terraria or starbound where if you click on a tile then that tile gets removed, it's a directional thing and the mining tool isn't center with the playable characters model, it is off to the side a little and it makes mining a real chore.

-Monsters
The monster spawns are attrocious, they spawn anywhere even in the air, which makes falling down elevators you dig suicidal, it encourages the use of teleportation but really I find this a constricting mechanic and very poorly thought out by the developers. A fix that would make everyone happy in my opinion would be to limit mob spawns to front tiles or certain background tiles (such as dirt, clay etc)

-Monsters continued
Mobs can spawn in the air, regardless of the foreground or background tiles, I have confirmed this, and this doesn't only effect elevators and general exploration, mobs can spawn inside hangers you built for your vehicles, and those ships will die as the mob mindlessly floats back and forth rebounding off walls etc. This is completely ridiculous and wastes your resources needlessly.

-UI
The UI is a complete mess, it is extremely user unfriendly and lacks specific interactions like shift clicking to place items into recipe facility entities like the carbon refinery for example. You have to mouse them in one by one and when recipes require 5 items that are cluttered around your inventory, it is not fun to micromanage and makes organising inventory space and much more, a very annoying task.

-UI overlays
To add onto some of the UI problems the game has, the UI overlaps the screen in some instances, such as when ""dominating"" an area (or setting am item recipe as a task), the overlay that displays you have conquered the area acts as a none transparant pop up, basically it stops you from shooting or building while mousing over the overlay and this can lead to some pretty cheap deaths as I have experienced.

-Gameplay
The gameplay for the most part is fine, you progress at a steady pace and you are rewarded for killing monsters and mining generated tiles. However the dungeons you come across such as the zombie rooms seem to feel extremely off. You have to destroy 4 spawners and once that is complete, you have to plant 3 bombs, leave the chunk and then the entire land is just blown up. Any decoration blocks you might have wanted from the room are deleted, and you're left with an unappealing piece of land that does nothing. The game says you've ""dominated"" the land but you're just left with an ugly crater. Furthermore, you aren't rewarded in the slightest by blowing the chunk up, no EXP, no loot, nothing.

-SNAILS
HOLY FUCKING SHIT, SNAILS AND FROGS HAVE TO BE THE SINGLE MOST ANNOYING MECHANIC I HAVE EVER WITNESSED IN A VIDEO GAME. PLEASE NERF THEIR SPAWN RATE, IN FACT THAT BRINGS ME ONTO MY NEXT POINT

-Spawn rate
Monster spawn rate either seems to be so few or so disgustingly unbearable, the amount is completely random, you coulld be spelunking in a cave and come across one or two mud crabs, but then teleport back to base and an entire army of frogs, snails and crabs will rain from the sky.

-Frame rate
This is a really unfortunate aspect of the game, I have a really high end computer and I get frame lock ups quite often, it's not a long lock up but it is very common and happens in loaded chunks even if I am standing still. I don't have a clue what causes it and as far as I can tell from other reviews this seems to be a common problem.

-Rare crashes
The game as crashed a few times on me now. both times have happened when starting up a pregenerated world and entering a container too quickly. I am sure this will be fixed but it added to the frustration this game is to play right now.

-Instance glitches
In an instance you are similar in proprties to that of adventure mode in minecraft. You cannot place or remove blocks basically. If you happen to click too fast on a door (which is basically a teleporter to another part of the dungeon) yoiu can very easily be teleported out of bounds and you have to exit your game to fix the problem. The items needed to enter an instance dungeon aren't cheap so I find this to be a very harmful bug that impedes progression.

-Exploration
Now this may be due to the overall difficulty of the game, and I may be playing the game without fully understanding the metagame and what not, but I find exploration into the second biome (I think it's refered to as the comet biome, it's the ice themed one) to be extremely unforgiving. I have the weapons to deal with the monsters there in small numbers, but as I have said, as you fall down to lower levels, mobs spawn in the sky and can basically 1 hit ko you as you fall, but that's not the only problem, as you land on the surface of the main tier 2 biome, mobs that are faster than you are generated all around you, on the ground and in the sky and that makes exploration and progression an absolute chore. I have tried to find a way to set my spawn down there instead of on the first biome and I'm not sure how. The wiki for Edge of Space is extremely outdated and many pages are missing.

-Exploration continued
I have solved the issue of teleporting to lower levels, you have to build 2 command centres to teleport between areas. However now that I don't have to deal with the annoying elevator scenario, I have discovered that towards the lower half of the second biome, bears and penguins spawn in great abundance, regular bears can 2 shot you, and have more than doube the players moving speed so in tight spaces it is very hard to escape, they spawn almost everywhere in the cave systems down there and I simply cannot progress further below. I enjoy a hard game but I think something seems off with the spawn rate, they appear so frequently that I feel stunted to go any deeper. You might be thinking that I should gear up a little more before progressing, which is true, but all the radium I can find in the ice and all the illuminated crystals (that can drop radium) have been mined up in the top half of the biome. I made the mistake of building one of those NPC anchors with the radium (he was a useless NPC as well, did 100% nothing and that brings me onto my next point shortly) and now I lack the amount to create the desert armor set.

-NPC Anchors
I really like this idea, it's another resource sink and the potential for some really cool bonuses is there, but the developers really missed the mark on most of them. I believe Rob the robot is the most useful, fully upgraded he will drop Titanium ore for you occasionally, I have about a stack and a half of the stuff just sitting around and as Titanium is a pain to harvest, I like this NPC and my investment was worth it. However, NPCs such as Vinny (The potato plant) do nothing, regardless of the investment, his one ability is that every time you feed him 5 biomass and 5 ice, he will glow in the dark. That's ridiculous, I have lights everywhere, the investment and the space for his anchor completely outway his use. This is very similar for the other NPC's too, they could provide cool bonuses like 5% to sneak, or ore in a radius will glow, something that would actually be fun to invest these resources into. But nope, glow in the dark plants are apparently useful.

-Hit word limit, much more is broken-","I've played the game long enough now that I can give a basic review for the game. In terms of the knowledge progression I'm about 6% complete or so it says. I can say confidently enough that the game is interesting and has some decent mechanics that set it apart from similar games like Terraria and Starbound.

However, this game is very much a buggy mess right now and I would not say this is worthy to be called V1.0, it is very much still an early access game in my mind and if you are hoping to play this game without upset, I feel I need to tell you that you will be let down.

-Mining
Mining feels clunky at the best of times, it doesn't work like terraria or starbound where if you click on a tile then that tile gets removed, it's a directional thing and the mining tool isn't center with the playable characters model, it is off to the side a little and it makes mining a real chore.

-Monsters
The monster spawns are attrocious, they spawn anywhere even in the air, which makes falling down elevators you dig suicidal, it encourages the use of teleportation but really I find this a constricting mechanic and very poorly thought out by the developers. A fix that would make everyone happy in my opinion would be to limit mob spawns to front tiles or certain background tiles (such as dirt, clay etc)

Since the game was on sale I decided to take a chance with it since I'm really drawn to the artstyle and general concept of the game itself.  I'm actually surprised that I liked the game as much as I do since I played Starbound before and it didn't really impress me as much as EoS does.

A few things I do have to mention though is that, yes the tutorial isn't that informative but since a lot of people have played games such as Starbound or Terraria and Eos is in the same genre, a lot of the functions and basics are the same as well.

Another thing is the lack of any active server searching function within the client, as far as I know of right now, servers are spread through word of mouth or in forum posts, but most of the big servers have been shut down already so there isn't a huge population in multiplayer that anyone can just jump in (Again, I may be wrong since I've only been playing the game for a little bit)

Last thing I really wanna recommend to anyone thinking about playing the game is to really stick with it during the beginning, because things are slow and gathering seems like a drag, but once you start getting into the game more, you'll find that Eos has a lot of depth, potential, and it's own personality that separates this game from the other games in the same genre.  Seriously though, you can build a giant mech suit, what more do you need to convince you to buy this game?","I was skeptical about this game when I first looked into it, the reviews on steam seems to have a really hit and miss feel to the game.

i guess in total it equals to amount an hr and a half of gameplay. i DID pause here and there.


part 1 showcases character creation. and a few quests(tasks) to that oh so loveable shark. and me messing and learning with the controls. plus i farm a few things

part 2 showcases me finally understanding how to upgrade and learn more stuff to craft. from there i get more dareing and start exploreing and killing off the hostile that plague the planet. 

after a bit of reading. i think im suppose to take over the planet and teraform it to my liking while bathing my self in the richs of all the amazing things i find.

AH PS. my videos are long. i dont cut them via edit. all raw footage. 

overall great game. i love what the devs have done. the price is just perfect for the type of game it is. and for a game at launch. i can see atleast a few hundrend of hours in terms of time sink to get to that end game feel. as said in my videos i've only scratched the surface of unlocking stuff.
i've barely even gone down 70ft into the planet. if people keep ranting that this is just another ""2d voxel clone"" just ignore them. this game is really worth having and it has that sci fi feel that i've always wanted.

I've stuck with this game and I still enjoy it.  It is a crafting, exploring game in 2D... but it's in space!  And if you like space games that are open world and exploritory, I think you'll find this one not to like.  The are lots of materials to search for, interesting knowledge tree to work towards for crafting new gadgets and gizmos, and plenty of creepy monsters and weird vegetation to learn about.  So if you like figuring out the unknown, you'll like this.  It's kinda like Terraria, Metroid, and Star Trek blended together, with a dash of Avatar but something kinda unique too.

The Edge of Space development team says they will keep improving this game post release and I hope they do.

3 things which need some immediate attention by the development team include:

-  The game engine processes data and movement too slowly compared to other games in this genre.  The result is that movement is slow and battle can be clunky for game play.  I don't think this is my processors' or video card's fault as I play similiar games with even better graphics and gameplay, without so much latency.  Maybe the coding could be tighter / more real time.  Seems like a lot of processor overhead going on.

- The opening movie is pretty untelling still.  It's better now that it's 1.0 but this is supposed to be the intro to the adventure.  The user doesn't get a good sense of what the background story is and where they fit in.  And what's with the other 3 organizations with different symbols?  Are they competitors or allies?  Are they the Ark Corp council?  Are they the ones who blew up our ship or was it an alien war?  It's hard to tell and it shouldn't be.

-  The addition of Fineous the Shark has helped teach new players (and older ones) what the controls and game mechanics are.  It could be a little more obvious though.  Probably the best way is to make sure the Codex has more content and the user knows right away that this is their one stop shop for learning about their new world, and how and what an agent of Ark Corp is supposed to do and try to acheive.  Some more work on the goals of the game are needed.  The Codex should be like our 'Hitchhikers Guild to the Galaxy'; everything you need to know when you thunk on a new planet in a Cryopod without any friends or contact with where you blasted off from, after a long cryo-frozen nap. I like the sense of humour though so far; keep that going.

That's my thoughts on this game so far.  I recommend, as long as you don't expect perfection just yet but I think it's worth supporting and playing.  It's fun and interesting to explore.

Внутриигровая справка вам не поможет, а будете выспрашивать всё у случайных людей на форумах или доходить до всего сами. Игра не интуитивно понятная.

Много разных видов оружия и брони. Если с бронёй всё понятно, то с оружием беда - нельзя посмотреть статы до создания. Вот пишут ""Мега-лазер, испепеляющий всё на своём пути"", а создаешь его, да, испепеляет, комаров да мух...

Отдельное слово скажу про данжи. Как только вы попадаете в данж, будьте готовы к тому, что в нём много одинаковых комнат и легко можно запутаться ""а откуда я вообще пришёл"". Монстры, тем временем, снова появляются в предыдущих комнатах и это раздражает. Можно промучиться час реального времени, чтобы найти босса, сдохнуть от него и начинать данж сначала...

Игра создавалась для кооператва и воевать в одиночку трудно. Вас просто задавят числом. А при битве с боссами так вообще не сможете осуществить нужные манёвры (те, кто играл в Gears of War с компьютерным напарником, снова почувствуют эту боль).

В остальном, ЕоС - красивая пиксельная приключенческая игра. Если вам понравились террария или старбаунд, у вас крепкие нервы и твёрдая решимость освоить кучу непонятных вещей, то мимо этой проходить тоже не стоит ;)",

--> better in game music (see above).

Movement feels a lot better; I have fun just jetpacking around and taking jumping-trickshots at the wildlife.

A lot of people have mentioned that it's a bit tough getting into the game at the start, and I would have to agree with that. Fineous's dialogue options help, but it can be really difficult deciding where to spend those first precious Science points.

My best tip: upgrade your jetpack (fighter, explorer, or builder) and make a better primary weapon (phase or melee) first! Having an upgraded jetpack makes a huge difference to mobility, and the starter weapon really seems to only be there to get you used to crafting -- by making you craft a better one.

I waited till post launch to play this game as it was something both me and my bf were looking at since we enjoyed terraria so much. So I will go through a few pros and cons from my experience thus far.

Pros 
- Gameplay is fun when playing with multiple people, there are features such as resurrecting dead players that you will miss out in if you play singleplayer.
- Questing is quick and easy normally. It can be a bit grindy for some of the quests but the rewards seem to usually be worth it. It instills a sense of progression that is enjoyable to experience.
- The details on your character armor and progression trees that allow you different armor if you play a certain style give a unique vibe and add potential replayability.
- Knowledge skill trees give you lots of ways to specialize as you progress in early game and it is especially helpful if you have multiple players with you, letting you all specialize in different ways and combine your knowledge to progress quicker.

Cons
- Do not try to exit game and try to get back if you are running a server. The steam client will not allow you to start game back up till you take your server down. This is also a huge problem if you crash or have any gamebreaking bugs.
- [strike]Got stuck in a wall by jumping into it during first hour of play, only way I could solve it was to quit game and log back into multiplayer server.[/strike] Issue fixed as of sept 19th hotfix.
- Exploding monster nests can leave the sound of bomb alarms going off long after its been destroyed, making an annoying sound that just wont disapear.
- Monster ai leaves a  lot to be desired.
- Building seems to take a while to make anything worthwhile and there is not as much a need to build actual homes like other games in this genre.
- It is incredibly challenging to figure out how to get many types of building materials, leading to constant searching of wiki to figure out how to find many types of materials.
- Certain materials that were used in many types of items were incredibly rare to find, making it so that more people you had with you, the more challenging and difficult it was to even find enough materials to get everyone basic items.

Overall, I would recommend waiting on this game for a few more patches or unless you like what you see. The game is enjoyable but there is quite a few issues with it that can lessen the enjoyment in both singleplayer and multiplayer post launch.","Cautious Recommendation.

I waited till post launch to play this game as it was something both me and my bf were looking at since we enjoyed terraria so much. So I will go through a few pros and cons from my experience thus far.

Pros 
- Gameplay is fun when playing with multiple people, there are features such as resurrecting dead players that you will miss out in if you play singleplayer.
- Questing is quick and easy normally. It can be a bit grindy for some of the quests but the rewards seem to usually be worth it. It instills a sense of progression that is enjoyable to experience.
- The details on your character armor and progression trees that allow you different armor if you play a certain style give a unique vibe and add potential replayability.
- Knowledge skill trees give you lots of ways to specialize as you progress in early game and it is especially helpful if you have multiple players with you, letting you all specialize in different ways and combine your knowledge to progress quicker.

Cons
- Do not try to exit game and try to get back if you are running a server. The steam client will not allow you to start game back up till you take your server down. This is also a huge problem if you crash or have any gamebreaking bugs.
- [strike]Got stuck in a wall by jumping into it during first hour of play, only way I could solve it was to quit game and log back into multiplayer server.[/strike] Issue fixed as of sept 19th hotfix.
- Exploding monster nests can leave the sound of bomb alarms going off long after its been destroyed, making an annoying sound that just wont disapear.
- Monster ai leaves a  lot to be desired.
- Building seems to take a while to make anything worthwhile and there is not as much a need to build actual homes like other games in this genre.
- It is incredibly challenging to figure out how to get many types of building materials, leading to constant searching of wiki to figure out how to find many types of materials.
- Certain materials that were used in many types of items were incredibly rare to find, making it so that more people you had with you, the more challenging and difficult it was to even find enough materials to get everyone basic items.

First, this is just an opinion of mine. Second, others may feel completely different then me about this game.

I bought this way back in the beginning on desura when it was just a wee pup. Did some basic exploring, fell a million feet to the hard crusty core a million times, got bored and didn't touch it for a couple years. I thought the final game would be well rounded with some good end game content and perhaps missions etc, what I see here is the same boring game from day one. I.... just... coundn't... get into it. Game progression was dismal. I haven't found any cool structures or bases or bosses or anything other than stupid space jellyfish and floating orbs of death. I dunno, perhaps if I put in an additional 100 hrs I'll find all that I'm missing in the game but ain't nobody got time for that. I say buy it on sale if you really want a go at it or else find a more polished 2d minecraft-esq game.

Pros:
The graphics are pretty awesome
The creatures are very original
You can build huge fortresses
You can craft a whole lotta sh.... stuff.
Multiplayer!!

Cons:
Quite boring playing solo
Enviroments are very much the same as far as I could tell
No actual story line or Lore to keep me intrigued in the world I was living in
No NPCs to interact with, buying selling of goods and such
No Goals that I could find
No real point to playing.... I feel sh... bad saying it but there it is....

 Sorry Devs, I really hoped it would turn out better.  I wish there was a ""Not Yet"" button in the recommendation field. Keep my money though, at least you finished developing the game. I'll check back next year and see what improvements you have made.

PS: I thoroughly support the development of indie game such as this and while I particularly am not satisfied with EoS, I would still pay full price for this game just to see more like it come into the light and to keep 2d platforming alive.

         Lets get started shall we, I am amongst the first people who Green Lit this game and helped it out during its earlier iterations. This game has come a long way from where it once was, and only a few of us can attest to this because we come from an opinion that goes back to early alpha. On here it says I put 13.8 hours into it, but off of steam I had actually put 60+ hours into it. That was all mainly dedicated to testing out the new builds as they were being released and the new systems. This game went from being hard to figure out, to hard as nails, and then an awesome tutorial came through. Guess what, they kept up with the new tutorials making them more stream lined and easier for new players to pick up and play. Mind you, the tutorials at the very beginning were not nooby friendly, but they fixed that, and that was all based on players feedback. 

          From personal experiences, this game is a lot of fun and offers a lot to the player base at an extremely low price. These guys have worked day and night to bring a better experience to the table with each major update coming out with new fixes and added crafting recipes down to materials. More feedback is always a must when it comes to the on going production of a title, especially a creation one. StarBound, Terraria and Edge Of Space offer different experiences all together and yet each one has worked on content for each other to help promote one another. Edge Of Space for me is a gem in itself and it shouldn't be looked over because someone elses troll review. 
           
          Instead of trolling why don't you just go and tell the developers what is wrong? Because that would make to much sense I guess, give this game a try, 10. bucks isn't a bad deal and you are getting way more then that back in the content that is currently available.

The gameplay itself is fairly solid. If you're familiar with other side-scrolling survival games like Terraria or StarBound, you'll be right at home. The progression system to be able to craft better items for your base and gear gives you goals to work toward. Crafting that one weapon that plows through enemies you were having trouble with is always satisfying, and having missions to clear out an enemy nest is a good change of pace from resource gathering.

The biggest issue I've had with the game is the UI. Tooltips for players new to this particular game would be helpful. There are times when the screen becomes cluttered by the menus and crafting screens, and the screens themselves will become somewhat unresponsive at times after long periods of play.

Regardless of the game's issues, which I hope can be fixed in future patches, this is still a fairly fun game, and it's good for a change from the other survival side-scrollers.

It is also one of the most tedious and uninteresting games I've ever played. The basic gameplay loops are completely uninspired and dull. Terraria has wonderfully satisfying Metroidvania progression that makes slowly mining the world in order to acquire better gear and be able to defeat more difficult enemies an absolute joy to play.

The tutorial is no longer available. Just some message flash on the screen, too fast for me to read. and off to combat you go.

You get 5 exps for every block you dig, it varies for plants and none for combat to a maximun of 5k. If you go over 5k, you don't get any more exps until you spend what you have. Techs start out at 500 exp cost and go up from there.

They've removed the graphic pictures of the items in the crafting window. You can no longer match the icon with what you're crafting with what you already have. So unless you know the game well or remember everything, you'll probably end up crafting the same item twice.

I took an instant dislike to this game when I found out they use ""OR"" ""AND"" ""NOT"" and some other gates to get your power working. Seriously!!? You shouldn't have take a electronics class to understand how to use power in a game, after all it's only a game that supposed to be fun, not a lesson in science. 

Some of the items have the same name. For example, the Bosom Blaster, it's in 2 different tech tables, Phased Weapons and Research 1. So apparently I have to buy it in both locations in order to build it. This part really isn't clear to me.

The other thing I don't like is in the tech tree is that there are no stats for the weapons. So it's hit or miss as to what weapons you research.

Frankly for me, it's too much grind and repetativesness and not engaging enough to want to come back and play this game more often.","So I come to find out yesterdays negative review has been deleted.  Today v1.0 came out. Ever hear the term 1 step forward, 2 steps back. Prime example here.

When I first played, the game had a few graphical issues, and it looked like it could have needed something like an editor to an author. Fine, I could always go back to it - though at this point I was beginning to regret buying this. At this point (and a couple subsequent playthroughs), I felt the game was not intuitive, unfriendly to beginners, and rather difficult for a game where you literally build your character to advance. Gathering materials? The laser pick was extremely weak and could not be as easily manipulated as Starbound's (as much as I don't like comparing, especially to Starbound). I took a long time gathering enough supplies (after dying a few times, some from mobs in the starting area and some from falling off the edge of the map) to make anything. Also, while the game no longer has the difficulty (sort of...) and the 10 free respawn limit, those things severely discouraged me from doing anything. So I waited.

Today, I opened the game with no expectations of things and found myself facing similar issues from the first time I played. The UI needs a lot of work - this doesn't look at all like a modern game with a futuristic setting - the dialog boxes look like just hastily placed rectangles and fonts (I spotted some serif fonts...) look like they were not even picked with intent. Some of the tips need editing in syntax and grammar, and overall, the game feels very much like a beta still. I wasn't pleased by the ""tutorial"" either, since the first thing I saw was a codex full of unnecessary text.

Nothing in the game has struck me as intuitive so far, even regarding the gathering of materials. I got the DLC items and the pick is marginally stronger than the starting one, and while it's got a wider beam (3 tiles wide), the width becomes useless because the pick target cannot be directly chosen - so if you just dig downward, for example, in the same direction, you just end up with a 1 tile wide chasm, walls either damaged or already ""healed"" to normal. Everything seems so grindy already - I know that games won't have you start off with good gear ready to kill bosses, but in the first quest of the tutorial, each one of those enemies (although they do no damage) took many hits to die. I don't see any fun in spending minutes killing common mobs (because face it, you're gonna attract aggro for all those missed attacks and some of those enemies move too fast with the starting rifle) and then spending minutes gathering.

I'm going to pass. Sorry, I tried, but more than 2 years did not give sufficient progress for me to enjoy this - too grindy and too unpolished.","Looks like I got this game on July 9, 2013.

The very start we all picked different things to level up so we could all contribute in a team effort to go faster together.

We all built a base and struggled very hard to get our base working correctly with the power needed for each thing you place just so your stations will work so you can craft your things.

We tried out mounts and found them to be the worst thing in the game to invest your resources in for every reason you can think of, you cant take them into worthless dungeons, they die forever, they cost a ton and get killed super fast and are too slow to avoid damage as well as too big to get around like you thought they would be used for but no jetpacks are the best for getting around and always will be.

Dungeons are the most worthless waste of life in the game right next to Mounts, the gear you get from them is outdated the minute you can gather enough parts to make the dungeon key to enter it and the dungeons are so bugged you can't complete them most the time and the bosses are harder then the gear you have at the time to fight them to win, also most of your things dont work in the dungeon like jetpacks,mounts,doors, even entering the dungeon will some times crash your game and the doors teleport you to random locations some times making you unable to back track or even go forward or even leave the place alive so everything about it is a waste of life.

Edge of Space est un jeu sandbox en 2D, développé par Handyman Studios et édité par Reverb Triple XP. Il est apparu en accès anticipé sur Steam en 2013 et en est sorti en 2015.
[/th][/tr][/table]

Edge of Space est une des innombrables promesses indés non tenues : un jeu qui a montré beaucoup de potentiel mais qui fut abandonné par ses créateurs en étant incomplet. Mais il est important d'aller plus profond que ce seul aspect (pour certains rédhibitoire, j'entends), et de s'intéresser au jeu lui-même.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
On l'a souvent présenté comme un terraria-like, mais le gameplay d'Edge of Space se rapproche plutôt de Starbound, autant dans l'univers spatial, les mécaniques de minages ou encore les proportions des personnages.
Une des premières barrières, c'est de comprendre les possibilités du jeu et, tout simplement, quoi faire et comment le faire. Pour cela, vous avez accès à un codex avec notamment des tutoriels avec des vidéos incluses et surtout beaucoup de texte dans une mise en forme très sommaire. C'est entrée dans l'univers peut freiner et il faut faire l'effort de lecture pour comprendre un peu mieux les mécaniques qui régissent l'univers de ce jeu.
Au début de votre aventure, vous rencontrez un requin mécanique volant (équivalent du guide dans Terraria) qui va vous donner quelques quêtes (tuer des monstres et ramasser des matériaux, c'est vrai que ça n'est pas toujours très varié) et puis...plus rien ! A vous de vous débrouiller, d'aller explorer. L'exploration en elle-même reste plaisante même si la variété des biomes et des ennemis est limitée, il y a une joie à creuser toujours plus profond, à la recherche de nouveauté.

[b]Direction artistique[/b]
Les graphismes ont un effet illustration que je trouve assez laid, mais j'imagine que cela peut plaire à d'autres. L'arrière plan des environnements est un motif simpliste (la même image juxtaposée huit fois avec un peu de nuages en plus en bas) qui nous rappelle que le jeu n'a jamais été fini. Les ombres sont mal optimisées dans le jeu (trop fortes), ce qui implique de devoir éclairer énormément pour y voir quelque chose, donc de mettre des torches littéralement partout. En ce qui concerne l'interface même du jeu, elle est peu ergonomique et fouillis (par exemple difficile de se retrouver dans la table de craft)

[b]Audio[/b]
La musique est calme et agréable, comme dans Starbound, mais assez répétitive. Il y a quelques FX associés aux ennemis, mais je ne les ai pas trouvés très réussis et ils ne participent pas à rendre le monde vivant ou immersif.

[b]Conclusion[/b]
A la sortie de la béta, j'ai été très déçu. Les développeurs ont sorti un jeu qui ne sera jamais fini et qui pourtant a un certain charme. Dix ans après, je le redécouvre et je me plaît à y traîner des heures.
Je recommanderai à quiconque n'ayant pas fait Terraria puis Starbound de d'abord jouer à ces jeux qui sont bien plus complets. Ceci dit, après y avoir beaucoup joué, étant en quête d'alternatives, Edge of Space reste une proposition intéressante. Il ne vaut pas son prix, mais en cas de promotion importante, pourquoi ne pas tenter le coup ?","[table][tr][th]
Edge of Space is a 2D sandbox game developed by Handyman Studios and published by Reverb Triple XP. It entered Early Access on Steam in 2013 and was released in 2015.
[/th][/tr][/table]

Edge of Space is one of countless unfulfilled indie promises: a game that showed great potential but was abandoned by its creators for being incomplete. But it's important to delve deeper than this aspect alone (a deal-breaker for some, I mean) and to focus on the game itself.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
It's often been presented as a Terraria-like, but Edge of Space's gameplay is more similar to Starbound, in terms of its space universe, mining mechanics, and character proportions. One of the first hurdles is understanding the game's capabilities and, quite simply, what to do and how to do it. To do this, you have access to a codex with tutorials, including videos, and, above all, a lot of text in a very basic format. This entry into the universe can be a bit of a drag, and you have to make the effort to read to better understand the mechanics that govern the game's universe.
At the beginning of your adventure, you meet a flying mechanical shark (equivalent to the guide in Terraria) who will give you a few quests (kill monsters and collect materials; admittedly, it's not always very varied) and then... nothing! It's up to you to figure it out, to go exploring. Exploration itself remains enjoyable even if the variety of biomes and enemies is limited; there's a joy in digging deeper and deeper, in search of something new.

[b]Art Direction[/b]
The graphics have an illustrative effect that I find quite ugly, but I imagine others might like it. The background of the environments is a simplistic motif (the same image juxtaposed eight times with a few more clouds at the bottom) that reminds us that the game was never finished. The shadows are poorly optimized in the game (too strong), which means you have to use a lot of light to see anything, meaning you have to put torches literally everywhere. As for the game's interface itself, it's cluttered and awkward (for example, it's difficult to navigate the crafting table).

[b]Audio[/b]
The music is calm and pleasant, like in Starbound, but quite repetitive. There are a few enemy-related FX, but I didn't find them very effective and they don't contribute to making the world feel alive or immersive.

[b]Conclusion[/b]
When the beta came out, I was very disappointed. The developers released a game that will never be finished, yet it still has a certain charm. Ten years later, I'm rediscovering it and I enjoy spending hours playing it.
I would recommend anyone who hasn't played Terraria and then Starbound to play those games first, as they are much more complete. That said, after playing them extensively and looking for alternatives, Edge of Space remains an interesting proposition. It's not worth the price, but if there's a major sale, why not give it a shot?"

Having said that, I think EoS has a better soundtrack of the two. 4/10

This game is a hell of a lot of fun.  I have spent my time building a main base and burrowing fully enclosed tunnels outwards in every direction to mine the resources whilst being able to protect myself after sun down.  The monsters are punishingly difficult to control and kill hence my paranoia.  I found the difficulty initially frustrating but having conquered my local landscape I feel proud.  Any attempts to venture outside my zone of control are met with caution but as my confidence grows I am becoming more able to endure the relentless onslaught.

The science research tree is full of gaps.  For example, you will research tech level one in 'companions' and be able to craft your own floating torch but unlocking tech level two will garner you nothing.  Why not merge tech trees from different categories?  The intention may be to keep a certain clarity by separating 'companions' from 'weapons' from 'base building' but I am only just starting to understand that fact by writing down my thoughts.  At the time of playthrough the science tree just felt unfinished.  That is probably also symptomatic of early accesss games.","[h1]just a slice of my thoughts on the game by no means encompassing the whole[/h1]

Old review:
So at one point in starting to play this I thought ""where'd they get Starbound's source code from?"" and then realised it was just a little bit more than that. 
I'm not sure what to think of this, but I know one thing: over the years I've been playing games and then trying to recreate them in my own way, trying to get some idea of good game mechanics. This is what would happen if I successfully did that after playing Terraria and Starbound. 

The reason I can't recommend this is that I can't recommend Starbound either, - and Starbound even adhered to certain game design principles Edge of Space does not. For example, DLC or content purchases - and I can't help but feel like it's Starbound remade. 

/impressions

Since reviews aren't just opinion meters and-
Oh, they are. 
Well here's a breakdown anyway:

[h1]Art[/h1]
The art is quite good, but I can't look past the animations, which I personally don't much like. They seem slightly unnatural somehow, as if forced or overacted. 

The music is okay, and at times reminds of a certain game that parallels EoS a lot.
Then again, there isn't a whole lot of it yet, so I can't be sure.

[h1]Usability[/h1]
One thing I quite like is how the game is actually somewhat intuitive. I mean it has all that arbitrary stuff where you go through the tiers of equipment and unlock things that you would realistically have beforehand, but I can overlook that since it's an industry standard, no matter how dumb it is. 
The tutorial goes through the mechanics and controls at lightspeed. Something that's great for someone like I, who plays games like Xonotic, but would be really damn hard for anyone who isn't used to learning new controls extremely quickly. The rest of the game seems to just leave you to do what you want after the tutorial, which is good and bad, depending on how you look at it. 

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
As usual, sandbox style progression using ""tech"", and unlocks of new gear.
There isn't much emphasis on building, possibly because there's not really much need, and possibly because the small hotbar and needing to manually stock it with stuff all the time is a nightmare, at least coming from games like Starbound which allowed you to place things by picking them up in the inventory. A small issue I have with it, but I'm sure many people would feel the same. 

[h1]Systems, bugs, exploits, map generation, etc.[/h1]
The map is automatically smoothed by making every top corner (tiles y-1 and x±1 are air) 45°. Not a great feature, since building with this in mind can be very annoying. 

There are too many bugs to go into. I'm hoping this is because it's still in EA. 

The map generation algorithm is pretty basic. Very similar to Starbound, but less to explore for lack of content so far. out of the few worlds I've looked at, all are the same flattish top island with other small islands above and below. It's a little like an extremely dense asteroid belt. It's not incredible. 


Overall, this seems kind of interesting, but not so much so that a person who just bought the Weekly Bundle would give it a good review.

I'm disappointed when I learned about this, and I do wish that by some miracle, the developers will return to the project.

Unfortunately, I doubt this will happen, and thus I will leave this as a warning to not play this game.


Following below is my original review, to see my experience from when I was active.



Now noted, I played Terraria a few months ago, did some multiplayer with a few friends, and got bored of it. It has been a few months since I last touched it.

Going into this game, I was launched into the tutorial, and got a far better grasp of the basic mechanics than I did when I first got thrown into Terraria. While both do not require special placement for materials and such, this game gave a different emphasis that yes, even dirt is an important resource.

I think that's what really got me into this game. Every resource you mine actually has a use, and you don't have to dump piles of dirt into a chest so it doesn't clutter your inventory. You actually need dirt now.

Another thing that gives this game an edge against other games in this genre is the fact that you get decent ranged weapons through the tutorial. Normally you get a junk sword and all ranged weapons run on limited ammunition. Here, there's infinite ammo and it serves you well enough until you can research better schematics later on. I think that's important.

Finally, I just like the overall look. The background, the creatures, and your character all have a pleasing look that also saves resources so it doesn't eat up the GPU. It has an art style that branches off just enough where it doesn't look too foreign, but still has its own identity.

All in all, good game. If you get it on sale, you got a really good deal.","EDIT: After checking recent news of this game, I had to change the review to not recommend it.

I really can't get into the look and feel of this game and its game play, it certainly is no Terraria or Starbound, and there's nothing really unique in the first 1.5 hours that makes me want to keep playing. There's just the prospect to mine blocks, or grind creatures for XP, to ""unlock"" things that I can then build.

I think that the UI is terrible, it's visually not appealing, it gives next to no feedback, and it's unresponsive. But I think I already read that 2 years ago. Once you mass up (unlock) items to build it gets rather hard to use. The components required to build things are questionable at best. Dirt, mud, clay, rock, to build a large variety of items, huh.

There are billboard missions you can take to get more rare stuff (is it the only way?) like aluminium or uranium, they are simple and seem buggy. For example, having two missions to collect 50 dirt immediately completes both if you have 49+ dirt in your inventory, and collect just one more piece of dirt.

When you play the tutorials where you need to shoot humanoid training dummies, it becomes immediately apparent that the hit boxes are... let's just say, you have to hit them in a certain spot, their legs for example are completely off the hit box boundary.

If you have neither played Terraria, or the Terraria 1.3 update, I'd recommend that instead, or keeping an eye on Starbound. I've put over 100 hours into Starbound around December 2013, when they first made a public Alpha release, which really puts a unique spin on the whole Terraria feel and it has an absolutely amazing soundtrack.","It's really hard to believe that this game is ""finished"" and shall be released September 2015, at the time of my review it's August 14, 2015.

[h1] Графика. [/h1]
Осваивая игру, я все больше понимал, что Создатели Террарии будто брали идею с похожей игры StarBound. То же космос, те же неизведанные планеты и живность. Да, вроде все тоже самое, но есть большое различие. И самым главным различием (и наверно грубейшей ошибкой) это Early Access. Разработчик Неверно поставил приоритеты разработки игры, углубляясь корнями куда-то в сторону. Какие-то крафты, шмотье, декорации... Они начали пихать все и вся, не задумываясь о том, что это еще и нужно довести до ума. В итоге, мы получаем сборную солянку. Там недоделано, там баг на баге, а это вообще заставляет с ужасом закрывать игру.
И ведь соглашусь, картинка местами хороша, приятна. Но это только местами. Точкой апогея стал ""самотроллинг"" в виде  Глитч плаща. (Плащ, у которого анимация будто битая. Есть даже замудренное описание.) Зачем нужно было добавлять битый элемент одежды и чуть ли не тыкать им в нос при старте игры?
[h1] Геймплей. [/h1]
 Это помесь того же [u] Старбаунда и Террарии. [/u] Неудачная попытка скрестить оба мира вылилось в нечто непонятное. Крафт до боли неудобный, кривое исполнение боевки. Повторюсь, это была явная попытка скопировать Старбаунд. а исследовать мир у меня отбило желание сразу, вынуждая [u] выкопать ямку поглубже и завалив вход, сидеть и рыдать. [/u] Дисбаланс окружающей среды заставлял порой бежать от каких-то таракашек в панике и чуть ли не танцуя косить громадных монстров с той же экипировкой.
[h1] Мой вердикт: [/h1] 
Я категорически не советую покупать эту игру. (по крайней мере сейчас) Вы даже маловероятно найдете пиратку этой игры, настолько она не обзавелась популярностью. Разработчик наплевательски отнесся к Early access, Собирая патчи, будто они не выходят за пределы оффиса. Не делая упор на чем то малом, они решили сделать Все и сразу и предсказуемо оступились. Игра выглядит сырой и непригодной для спокойного времяпровождения. Не столько враги враждебны, как сама игра по отношению к играющему в целом.
Учитывая, что играл я года два назад, мне до сих пор не хочется притрагиваться к этой игре, настолько она оказалась для меня разочарованием. Но тогда еще не было Отзывов, поэтому пишу я только сейчас.","[h1] !!!ACHTUNG!!! THIS REVIEW IS WRITTEN FOR THE 2013 VERSION! [/h1]
When I bought this game, I thought I'd be greeted by a beautiful world of futuristic adventures, with an atmosphere of uncharted territories begging to be discovered. Honestly, I only reached for my wallet because the game's trailers reminded me of Avatar. It was precisely that atmosphere and landscapes that deeply touched my soul. But... I've never been so disappointed, and here's why:

[h1] Graphics. [/h1]
As I played the game, I increasingly realized that the creators of Terraria seemed to have taken the idea from a similar game, StarBound. Same space, same unexplored planets and creatures. Yes, everything seems to be the same, but there is a big difference. And the biggest difference (and probably the biggest mistake) is Early Access. The developer misplaced the game's development priorities, delving into something completely different. Crafts, clothing, decorations... They started cramming everything in, without considering that it still needed to be polished. As a result, we get a hodgepodge of features. There's something unfinished here, there's bug after bug there, and it makes you close the game in horror.
And I agree, the visuals are good in places, pleasant. But only in places. The climax was the ""self-trolling"" in the form of the Glitch Cape. (A cape whose animation seems broken. There's even a convoluted description.) Why did they have to add a broken piece of clothing and practically shove it in your face at the start of the game?
[h1] Gameplay. [/h1]
It's a cross between [u] Starbound and Terraria. [/u] A failed attempt to cross both worlds resulted in something incomprehensible. The crafting is painfully awkward, the combat is poorly executed. Again, this was a blatant attempt to copy Starbound. And exploring the world immediately turned me off, forcing me to dig a deeper hole, block the entrance, and sit and cry. The environmental imbalance sometimes forced me to run in panic from some cockroaches and practically dance as I mowed down enormous monsters with the same equipment.
[h1] My verdict: [/h1] 
I categorically do not recommend buying this game. (At least for now.) You're unlikely to even find a pirated version of this game, it's so unpopular. The developer treated Early Access with disdain, collecting patches as if they were part of the office. Without focusing on anything small, they decided to do everything at once and predictably stumbled. The game feels unpolished and unsuitable for a relaxing pastime. It's not so much the enemies that are hostile, but the game itself is hostile to the player as a whole.
Considering that I played it two years ago, I still don't want to touch it again, it was such a disappointment. But there were no Reviews back then, so I'm only writing this now."

After completing few startup things (gathering resources, protecting robots) it is coming to a point where You are bored because You can't find anything new (~15 hours) or it gives You a head punch with difficulty level that is too hight (in the game events like 15 mobs spawning and shooting at You light bulbs that is extreamly hard to avoid). I do not recommend this game because sometimes recipes are not finished and in some points it is not intuitive (that is very important thing). Good thing would be adding some kind of direct portals (that You could craft on place with quite huge ammount of resources) to epic boss battles which would give You either uncommon/rare loot or resources that would be only available to drop out of this boss.
Things that could be usefull:
1. More boss fight (and except needed gear, also tactic required) + rare epic loot 1 in 100 or 1000 to drop
2. More special monsters that grant a nice reward
3. Combo shoots that gives a player sense of power (for example charging power for killing monsters and than when You want You can unleash it upon all foes dealing massive damage)

My opinion:
For now it is not as good as expected, however it offers creation of own server that You could play co-op/multiplayer. This game could use some features that will make it better and 12 Euro is a bit too epensive (but it's standard for most of steam games).","This game should be a repleacement for Terraria or atleast a comparable thing.

The lighting has been greatly improved but does bug out occasionally. Hopefully the game will soon be updated to polish up things a bit.

With regards to recommending it.... can I? Sadly no. If a friend asks me about this game, I would just tell him/her to buy terraria. The reason for this is because for a price 50% higher than terraria, you are getting a worser game. if this game with its issues was just 7.5 dollars, then it would be a good purchase however. One might argue that terraria has had years to develop while this game has just been released. That's true, but the price of terraria is still cheaper regardless. To be fair though, terraria is a seriously underpriced game, it should cost at least 20 dollars by now, considering all the content it has.

Despite the lack of recommendation, it must be stated that this game contains some really great innovations that are worthy of praise: 1) a build in link to wikipedia 2) a system that allows you to track down which materials you need to construct something. I really wish these two things were in terraria.

Edit: I am surprised by how obscure it turns out this game is. Not a single official reviewer has touched the game and there is only one user review on metacritic.

Played 15 minutes and had enough.
More a chore than a game. Graphics are poor and over saturated, gameplay is clunky and the inventory system is a pile of s♥♥♥.

Second review:

After my first review the developer sent me a message asking what I didn't like and saying that maybe I haven’t played enough to like it. Well guess what… I played it again (another 15 minutes). 

The game should be enough and shouldn’t be so needy to rely in the codex. Is a real pain to read that much instructions for something so simple… find stuff then build stuff.

The game is derivative, is like the Frankenstein of games but in a bad way. The graphics are just wrong… “Hey lets draw one sprite that make no sense and is not iconic and multiply it all across the screen, no matter if nobody understands what that is.”

Very poor move making enemies harder just because you go deeper... lack of imagination.

On the bright side it has a lot of funny bugs like the moonwalking and how the whole screen trembles whenever you try to pass through a gap in a wall.

By the way the collision system is a complete mess, it reminds me the game CheetahMen form Action 52’s for NES.

For those who don’t know what CheetahMen is (or what NES is…) here it is:

I only wish that steam would have accepted my refund request. They probably would have, if they ever played the game, and had access to the notes you can add if you say ""My reason isn't here"". I realize this game came out a long time ago, and I might like it more if there were actual guides on how to do stuff, rather than a little note saying what there is. Even if this game came out long ago, that just proves the developers are lazy and have no idea what else to do! Maybe post an in depth guide? Try doing something that hasnt been done many times before? Nope! They just went straight for clone of a game that is way better: Terraria. The only things I see different is that this game has some back story, and the scale of character to block is larger. And even then the developers are trying to only get good feedback by deleting every post with some negativity. I'm sorry, but this game needs some serious work to make it worth the money i'll never get back.

[*]They fact that there is an area that counters all exposure protection, completely takes away the usefulness of exposure protection, I never get any warning about exposure with Earthen Armor anyway! 

[*]General Turk's (or was it Tuck? Turck?) introduction makes no sense, and I don't even know what happened after hes said to make a bunker! Was that it? Will I see him again? Or is he a useless NPC designed to make you annoyed and confused? 

[*]The knowlegde tree that grants locomotion isn't all that useful, in that it take almost 200,000 experience to get to stuff that doesn't require a cloning machine, which is also near impossible to get, becasue I have no idea how to unlock the knowledge tree that grants you it! 

[*]The Research knowledge tree also seems useless, what does it even do? All I see is a button to spend your EXP, and some pictures of guns. 

[*]The decoration items should also be unlocked through the Base Constructor knowledge tree, because nobody wants to spend valuable EXP which can be used for much more useful things instead of a useless knowledge track that is only apealing to fashion freaks.

[*]After you play for about 4 hours, you just get stuck. What else can I do? What is there to find but a large background with clouds that never changes unless it becomes night? The game is just to empty or lacks hints as to what else you can do.

[*]Maybe reduce the amount of EXP it takes to unlock the Raptors? After seeing a screenshot of them I rapidly aquired EXP to get them only to find that i needed over 20,000 EXP to get access to them.

[*]Maybe add in a health regen system? This kind of game needs one otherwise you just get frustrated everytime you go underground and find a couple Lively Slime who are very hard to kill and reduce your health to about 1/4.

[*]Maybe add to the flying laser shark thingy (sorry I forgot his name, I feel really bad) an option that lets him explain the knowledge tracks more in-depth? Such as making an option that opens up another list of options for him to explain the knowledge tracks separately. Some of them are very confusing and seem like useless things made to confuse you (as I said before).
[/list]

I hope this review draws the attention of sereval developers, and for the Steam user looking for a game to check out: I wouldn't recommend this game until it's out of early access or unless you can find an in depth guide out there that tells you what you need in order to progress beyond what 5 hours can get you.

About Turk:
He May have been triggered by me having what I think to be mid tiered weapons, such as the first Sniper Rifle available in-game, and the Assault Rifle-type weapon with a 35 round clip (both of these being researched under the weapons that require no ammo to be made)

Although I would love to do internal testing for a game, I am sorry but I cannot ""go out"" to any streams, as I am actually only 13 and my mom or dad arent really interested in taking me anywhere. If I could still do internal testing even though I cannot meet the Edge of Space team in person I would love too!
If you guys are willing to contact me through Steam or Skype (prefferably Steam, Skype takes up a lot of processing power that I would rather use for gaming, and it makes the frame rate drop majorly at random times) I can also do that! I look forward to your responses! =)

[b]Read past this first paragraph if you don't want to read what someone posted made up of hate comments and cranky statements[/b]

I only wish that steam would have accepted my refund request. They probably would have, if they ever played the game, and had access to the notes you can add if you say ""My reason isn't here"". I realize this game came out a long time ago, and I might like it more if there were actual guides on how to do stuff, rather than a little note saying what there is. Even if this game came out long ago, that just proves the developers are lazy and have no idea what else to do! Maybe post an in depth guide? Try doing something that hasnt been done many times before? Nope! They just went straight for clone of a game that is way better: Terraria. The only things I see different is that this game has some back story, and the scale of character to block is larger. And even then the developers are trying to only get good feedback by deleting every post with some negativity. I'm sorry, but this game needs some serious work to make it worth the money i'll never get back.

I purchased this game upon release into early access.  At that time, many of the advertisements were compairing this game to Terraria, hence the nature of my review

I had a lot of hope for this game.
  
Let me preface this by saying I love Terraria.  I played a ton of it with friends and by myself back when it was first launched, and again with all the updates with my girlfriend.  I went from thinking it was a 2D Minecraft rip off to a great game that reminds me a bit of your old school games (Ghost and Goblins comes to mind with the new Expert mode)  
  
Terraria had its charm in the exploration.  You died, a lot.  You learned from said deaths.  You learned different materials make different items.  You fail a lot, in funny and unexpected ways (i.e. Farming Wall of Flesh, then realizing that I had been equipping my armor in the social slot).  The exploration was in both the world itself, and the mechanics.  They gave you nothing, said ""Here is the world, have fun"" and that was it.  
  
Edge of Space forgets that.  I start a new character, and I am inundated with tutorials as if I was a toddler.  The game literally stops everything to tell you to right click to pick up an item from a chest, including a video.  I am all for tutorials done right, but this one is just patronizing. 
 
The UI is just trash.  I have a character menu, inventory, tech, ect.  They are all small enough to fit on the screen all at once, yet they are their own movable UIs with wasted space.  Not to mention if I want to craft something to equip, I may have to go through three different menus for it.  This developer took a huge step backwards in design. 
 
The character control is also a problem.  It just feels slow and unresponsive.  I felt like I was on a server lagging in single player (and with the rig I have, this game should not give me any delays whatsoever).  The feel of everything was just off too.  Mining is aiming a laser at a rock and waiting.  Terraria did it right, because you would hear the clanking as you mined, making it feel like you were doing something. 
 
Lastly is the performance.  It felt like it was running at 30, because I was getting that same blurriness I would get at lower frame rates.  The game however has a FPS counter that was staying at a solid 60.  I pulled up the Steam FPS counter, and low and behold, while it did stay around 60, it would very occasionally dip, but the in game FPS counter stayed at 60.  I have a feeling that this counter is not accurate, and the developer has static text up there, but I will not say 100%. 
 
I will end with this, Have I been harsh on this game, comparing it to Terraria?  Yes, very much so.  They have marketed it as the spiritual successor to Terraria, and thus started the comparison.  Sadly, it fell very short of the mark they were aiming for.

I wish to put this into the actual review itself, since this actually has me hopeful about the future of this game.  From the head developer in the comments from this review ""Thank you for your review, i think there rae some valid points we are trying to address. At the same time the game is meant to feel different.""  The developer actully listens top criticism in a positive way, which could make this game potentially great in the future.","***DIsclaimer***

What follows was the first glance I had after some time and probably will be or is already fixed, depending on when you are reading this. It is still in discussion down here, but nevertheless, I changed my mind about it.

----------

I like it a lot, you guys seem to be doing some slow improvement on your ""beta"" status though, wich I was following since the beggining, but you guys never finish it.
The fact that now you can't even disable accessories pisses me off so much I want to puke. I don't want that stuff in the face of my character, please add a config so it can be disabled!
And the longer you take to make the game, it seems that you make it worse, framerates drop every update, my computer can run every new game in the market at 60 fps but yours it stays at 42 at most. 
The movement is really awkward, it seems that I'm on top of a rail cart, as the character also slides on the floor. The jetpack is basically a joke, it barely lifts you up of the ground and it has already ran out of fuel.
The training dummies can't be hit below their waist wich makes no sense whatsoever.
The aiming and shooting is another awkward feature leaving you empty handed.

I really liked this game at first, at the start, but every update I see you guys publish is another piece of the game that comes back broken. I don't like the way this is going, but I'm just one person. I hope you guys can rescue it to all its glory, because the idea is absolutely astounding.

I hope you guys don't get me wrong this is not an empty critic, and I mean no harm, but anyway, best of luck to you all.","*ATTENTION*

Edge of Space speaks for itself what it's about (almost). You are an alien thrown into an unknown ""world"". Whether it was a planet or on an asteroid, even I'm not quite sure. Everyone complains it's hard to grasp but there is a tutorial at the beginning which I happened to accidentally skipped. Even so, I didn't find the game entirely hard to follow if you know the basics: collect materials, build a house/base, kill monsters, etc. Not to mention all the cool pets and mounts you can create. Come on...a laser to collect materials and space guns?! Jet packs to fly! It really sticks to the sci-fi feel. Oh, I would also like to add I love how smooth the movements are in this game.

The challenge is in figuring how everything works and the satisfaction when you do. 

Since last time that I played, the only thing I really would complain about is how each character was bounded to certain worlds if they were made in multiplayer/single player. You can't select any character to load into a world if that character wasn't made in that particular world. Some materials that can be collected in single player were unable to be gathered in multiplayer (but before I stopped playing this issue was already fixed). There weren't as many boss fights as I would like and their drops weren't always anything special. Overall, when I stopped playing I was merely waiting for more content to be released. 

I've seen a lot of reviews comparing this to Terraria and Starbound. If you like those games more then play those games instead of comparing it to this one. Why? Because if this game was exactly like Terraria then...that defeats the purpose of making a uniquely different 2D Sandbox game. Also, if you hop into the game for less than an hour and deem that it's awful then you're not even giving the game a chance. 

I would also like to repeat that this game is in EARLY ACCESS. There will be bugs and the sort so if you don't want a game that's in DEVELOPMENT, I would advise you to wait if you have no patience for an unfinished game rather than buy it and give it a bad review because it has a lot of potential.","First off, this game is amazing even though I haven't played it recently so I don't understand why there are bad reviews. I hardly ever write a review but I felt this game is worth my time reviewing. With all the new updates, I am actually going to set out some free time to play it again.

First off, you create a charater, mine an awesome-looking female with a mask which screams fuck off to any crab,jellyfish or any 'badguy' that thinks they can take a piece of me. 

Then we have the tutorial. I have read reviews where they say that the tutorial didn't help or it didn't give enough depth...well I'm sorry but you must be playing a different game. The tutorial has a video in the bottom right corner of the screen which demostrates how to do stuff and what you needed to do in order to advance through the tutorial. Yes I admit that at times the video played a bit fast so I couldn't keep up with the voice BUT there was text above the video so I didn't even have to worry about it.

Once the tutorial finishes you are thrown straight into the world with little knowledge of what to do next. My thoughts were to build a base...Captain Obvious here...Digging is simple, just like other games, and it wasn't long before I had a decent amount of materials in order to make a base. Now I had two options, Build it in the sky surrounded by jellyfish or on the ground overrun with plants and creepy crawleys. My choice...the sky. 

Now I'm not going to run it for you...Try the game you will like it. The ideas that are in this game are truely awesome...There are different guns and ones I would of never thought of such as the Ark Light which shoots torches for quick and easy light...'Oh boy I wish that was in Terraria' was said a few times.

Flaws...a few but none ruined the experience

I cannot claim to know almost anything about the game itself in terms of if it has storyline, how good the mechanics are later on in the game or what kind of a sandbox it is. I’m simply writing about my experience with it and what I should have done to avoid this. 

Personally what I didn’t like about the game which is unfortunate for the developers was the introduction. The thing that really allows you to make your first impressions (excluding the tutorial of course), sum up what your experience with this game is going to be like, how everything works etc. I had no problem with the tutorial. I very much enjoyed the general mechanics of the game. I liked how it works, I also could get used to the overall ‘look’ of the game and how it varies from Terraria’s cute pixels. However as soon as I started the actual game itself it all went down-hill. 

When I spawned I was confused. “Where was I?”, “What was going on?” I was hoping for some kind of guide (yes, like in Terraria. *sigh) to help me however I was instead met by a distressed, flying, talking shark who after saving politely asked me to make him a toothbrush out of uranium or something. Now, I DO NOT like the addition of quests and things like that on a sandbox. (And again it’s my fault for not watching or reading any reviews) so I was annoyed that I had been restricted already so soon into the game. I like having freedom in a game however a clock timing me down to gather materials to make a toothbrush was very annoying to say the least. However this not what annoyed me, no what annoyed me was the fact that I could not find any Uranium anywhere. So I decided to screw the quest thing and do what I had bought the game for. Explore a new alien world, and have no idea what to expect. However I soon fell off a cliff and almost died. Then I fell off another cliff. And another. And another. It was only then that I realised I must have spawned on the top part of the picture in the Menu of the game where there are many floating islands. I didn’t like this at all as I felt I was restricted to the area island where my spawn was. It didn’t feel like one big map for me to explore, rather different areas I would have to go to as the game progressed. So I decided I would go as far as possible and see if I could find a dungeon or something. After mining things from pretty far away from the spawn point I was told I had a full inventory. So I moved some stuff into the bin last of which was a block of ice which after being deleted I thought nothing off. However when I looked back into my hot-bar, my mining laser had been replaced by this ice. And as there don’t seem to be any instructions beyond the simple things shown in the tutorial I had no idea how to get my mining laser back into my hotbar. The UI was extremely confusing and I was rapidly losing my patience with it. I then killed myself again and spawned back to pod only to realise random things in my inventory were now ice. On top of all of this you cannot move anywhere in the map without being constantly attacked by flying jellyfish and millions of little ‘wolf things’ on the floor that are much faster than you meaning they start to accumulate faster than you can seem to kill them. All this just seemed rather unprofessional and I still had no idea what the hell was going on and why a flying, talking shark needed uranium for his toothbrush. The gameplay was not at all what was displayed in the second trailer and the story so far involved a talking shark. Was he to be my guide??? I just wanted to get to the building, exploring and killing bosses part. I suppose it's maybe just not that sort of game.

It’s not that the game was ‘bad’ as such it’s just that I believe the trailers were a bit misleading within the fact that one shows a Terraria like style of gameplay where your character is free to build and explore and the other shows a very interesting backstory that looked pretty prominent and seemed like something you would progressively learn about throughout the game through recruiting NPC’s, slaying bosses etc. None of this was in the introduction.

It’s entirely my fault that I neglected to look into the game before I bought it. In all honesty I am basically one of those people who just wanted a ‘Terraria in space’ thing. I should have watched other people play it before I blindly went in and bought it. The main two reasons I bought it Edge of Space over Starbound was A) It was £5 cheaper or so, ( ͡ᵔ ͜ʖ ͡ᵔ ) :D and B) I know the lead developer is a friend of Redigit and had permission to use some Terraria bosses (which makes my Terraria in space fantasy even more realistic) and must mean it will have some Terraria qualities. I know that the game is still in Early Access so is obviously far from perfect, but I just expected better. 

I suppose the whole point of Early Access is so that people can post their constructive criticism and the developers take it into account. So maybe I will purchase the game again when it’s properly released. I just wish the game had a little more freedom from the start, coincidently just like Terraria does (*another sigh) and not have a random quest to make a toothbrush for a shark out of uranium. Either way, make sure you WATCH GAMEPLAY for Edge of Space before you buy it because it can be different from what it seems. (I'm no proffesional, I just wanted to get my opinions out there!)

Fast forward to my picking it up on steam, and the game is completely different, more fleshed out and with its own unique personality. It's still very clearly not done yet. But the parts of this genre that make it fun to play, mining, gear and stat upgrading, and base building, are functional and enjoyable. It sounds like the developers have a clear vision in mind for what the game will be, and as it progresses in development that vision becomes more and more clear each patch both in the game's functionality and tone. 

TL;DR - It's early access done right. Game has regular updates and gets fleshed out more and more with each one.

16310953,english,2015.05.11 22:41,✅,✅,0.6738348603,61,"Funny story, actually. I bought this thinking it was Starbound, and was horribly disappointing. I have no idea what build I was getting into.

What I got into was pretty much ""build a base with a couple of buildings as a home-base, upgrade your characters and build armor and weapons, then kill the like 20 or so different enemies in the game.""

I mean the way to progress your character was to get little data-chips that would increase your xp.

It was cute, but it took waaaay too long to progress, and when you did a lot of the time it felt like half of your progress was for very little.

Now it's been a while, there's a pretty clear line between enemies that act as a faction that alert each other and gang up on you(can get really tedious at times, but as long as this is a beta that's all good) whereas there's other wildlife enemies where some'll be more aggressive, but less factional in that they communicate with others of it kind, and then other creatures doesn't really care that much, but gets mad or scared if you attack them.

Base construction used to have a power generator and a command center's CPU-distribution as their main sources of power for the base equipment. Now they have Command Centers that power parts of bases, but command centers will conflict with each other, so you'll either have bases build into segments, or bases placed in completely different edges of the map, still connected by the Command Centers as one can teleport from one CC to another.

There's the separation between Phase-type weaponry (that doesn't use ammunition) that does less damage than projectile-based weaponry(which does use ammunition), there's signs that they'll end up giving us energy-based weaponry as well.

Game's also got a few vehicles, as of patch 0.4458 we have the Zephyr, decent hp, medium speed vehicle, pretty large, would guess about 6x7 blocks-size or so? There's also a Thunderbird, which I haven't tried, but it's supposed to be more armored, but slower. Other than these mechanical vehicles there's mounts: A crab, a jumpy raptor, a fast raptor and a net with captured jellyfish that works like a hoverbike. Jellyfishbikes have very little fuel, but are way faster than traveling by foot, never tried mounts as I was worried their lack of ability to fly or hover would make it hard to traverse in any useful terrain, as there's not much to gain by scouting the surface, unless you're on-foot killing enemies for loot and XP.

Hope to see the ability to equip and upgrade vehicles and/or mounts with different types of weapons/mining equipment in the future(choosing between phase, projectile and energy, potentially even one additional weapon slot in specific cases would add interesting layers into the vehicles section I think) Definitely hope to see refueling stations/refueling kits in the future as some vehicles are way to expensive to have them permanently expire after traveling a short distance, not to mention that giving the vehicle retrievability until it's destroyed could justify increasing costs of vehicles, and giving it said weapon/armor upgrades as mentioned earlier.

Not sure what the devs have in mind in terms of npc's or vending machines, but so far this game is intriguing.

The different AI behaviors are also interesting in terms of there being completely passive AI, passive-aggresive AI, faction aggressive AI's and some that will camouflage themselves rather than attack you for survival.

Nature yielding multiple resources as well giving different elements like sap, bark, the leaves and seeds, which affects what players can do in terms of crafting. It's half interesting due to different categories of crafting materials (Inorganic(processsed)/raw, minerals/chemicals/organic etc) but I also halfway feel like plants and gems end up kind of taking up a little bit much inventory space, as much as I adore the complexity. It works, but with a limited amount of inventory space it's definitely tough if you're going solo. Which also makes the swarmy enemy spawns a bit tough to deal with. Haven't tried playing with friends yet, so would say this'd be way more fun multiplayer.

All in all, in its current state I think that if you wish to roll solo and only go for weapons and armor upgrades I think the game'll last a few days. If you're going for exploration, building bases, upgrading yourself and essentially minmaxing on everything on your own it'll be worth everything from 1 week and up depending on how fast you are with these kinds of games and how much time you have to play it. I'm thinking 15+ hours a day being super efficient and lucky with weapon stats(Because weapons' stats are semi-RNG. Dmg per shot, in-game gun visuals, accuracy, crit rate, Ammo cap, MAYBE reloading time, and refire rate/rounds per second). Although it's a bit buggy and pretty slow in its current state, its simple ""complexity"" in crafting and although the devs(and their resources) are in charge of how much they can do with it I think it has sick potential, even if they end up sticking with the content they have right now, although more stuff's always beyond appreciated. 

I'm very glad I stumbled across this game, and I hope it goes even further as this is awesome so far.

PS. Devs. PLEASE give me a way to change my looks. I'm stuck with a thing on my face that won't let me see the helmet-art.
Also, there's a bug where when you blow up a thing that explodes upon death with an exploding projectile, the explosion caused by the dying npc will destroy the projectile post-explosion and will cause a chain explosion in projectile and dead enemy, which nearly killed my application. If there was a way to fix that that would be great, meanwhile I'll make sure to only kill explosion upon death units with normal bullets.","Funny story, actually.

Every time I return to it after a long hiatus (caused, usually by frustration at being unable to progress because, to give a few examples, the devs couldn't decide where some resource or other should spawn and deciced not to put it into the game at all, or there is a typo in a crafting recipe) my saves won't work, half the in-game systems have been changed and the others are broken (dev-speak for those is ""not balanced yet"").
I want to love this game, I've spent a lot of time playing it, but untill the devs decide what they want to actually do with it it's very hard to recommend.

EDIT: I'd like to clarify, now that my hissy fit is over, that if there ever was a game that shows promise, then EoS is that game. It's just that, well, I want my saved games to work - at least for my character, if not for the world itself."

To keep it short - i like this game pretty much and game quite improved since long ago. Shamefully, no longer supported.

To tell the truth, 1.0`s feature wasnt suprise for me since i was in inner test team, yet those changes from last public build to 1.0 made game much more and quite much more entertaining. I'd even say it made game lively - tons of different events waiting for you to blow up (well, some of them do require you to bomb some places).

So, what's this game about? - it's about exploration of planet, on which you had emergency landing when ArkCo`s shop crashed (watch the intro cinematics for more story) - thus you're alone (or not - if multiplayer with friends) and now you need to explore this world, getting resources and making better  equipment in process (typical for all such games). Further you go down - better resources, more dungerous enemies, new places to visit. For most actions you get XP to spend in knowledge window to get access to better gear and new facilities.

EoS is about exploring ONE planet (different each time you make new world, following some generation rules obviously), furthermore - exploring it VERTICALLY - there are 3 biomes, which is placed vertically, even thought you will explore it in rather horisontal line, then moving down to next one. Also, note there isnt any solid terrain - rather flying chunks of it (codex it for why), thus you will not be forced to dig through solid terrain to get lower and lower.

Many ppl complaining about game being too hardcore at start since weapon you begin with sucks at dmg (lol, ppl didnt even bother opening crafting window to see 1 scematics of better gun being avaible). But dont get too relaxed - most of things on this planet seems to be made to be human-killers and death can me quick and/or painful :3
Ii expect ppl crying in few days about dying and respawning at start as annoying feature - even thought u can make and bind urself to better cryopods (respawn facility) to get respawn-at-dying-place points on time bases - cryorods.

Btw - game has no tutorial, outside window with knowledge - CODEX - about thing you find/unlocked and flying laser shark, which will teach you some basics. Why? - well, for world's optimisation and....more hilariously, some ppl failed to finish tutorial or even simply passed by w/o learning and then stormed forum/reviews with questions tutorial had answer on :3
Really, so far it's not very hard to understand a game.

Those confused by low % of positive rewievs - most of negatives are made by those, who didnt bother to lurking around about game or didnt play enough (under 10hours - not even worth looking at), as well as people wanting Starbound clone.

Pros:
- interactions with developers - they do respond within a day (depending on timeline of yours) and they're friendly. Seriously, they even used to run server to play with players and they do take in account suggestions of players about what to implement;
- helpful people;
- Quite big sandbox-generated world - can travel to new places, see alot monsters and kill them. 3 biomes with different flora, fauna - so you will not see all the same things for whole game.
- build your base, place facilities and decorate at your taste (alot stuff will be coming, thought even now you can spend few hours decorating);
- rpg-oriented - alot stuff to research, player-style-oriented armor sets and kits;
- quite nice amount of armors (3 trees: fighter, explorer, builder - all with unique and useful bonuses), weapons (phase - unlimited ammo and weak strikes, projectiles - limited powerful crafted ammo, energy - not present yet) and facilities to place;
- SCI-FI setting;
- some humorous moments;
- Pretty nice graphics;

Cons:
- only English as supported language atm;
- no way to pause game (thought placing command node and teleporting to command center placed in your haven saves the day);
- a bit hard to set multiplayer server - there is a complete How-To guide on forum thought;
- not exatly your average YOBA in terms of game's info - well, Codex, npcs and your brain should be enough to figure out the game (at least many questions are answered on forum since long ago)

neutral:
- farming - as in any rpg of such type, you gonna need to get resources for ur stuff, thpught getting most of resources isnt hard during traveling - just keep your eyes open. If playing solo - one might consider getting builder sets for quicker digging;
- 2d game - yep, no realistic 3D graphics (like in 60-usd games);
- not newbie-friendly in some terms (tutorial thing explained above), since not everything is explained, chewed for you and put in your mouth with spoon. If you run into trouble - i'm currently making game's guide:
http://steamcommunity.com//sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=448294464 feel free to open it. If reading forum and guide still left you with question - feel free to ask me.
- more multiplayer-oriented, than singleplayer game (noone stops from playing alone thought. Truth to be told, i donno about other simular games and their MP/SP orientation)

state of game:
- 3 biomes present and filled (with mobs, plants, events and stuff).
- dungeons - instances to find some specific resources and bosses.
- animal mounts and vehicles;
- multiplayer (thought require to have someone hosting server);
- guns (3 trees) and melee, armors (3 different trees w different type of bonuses), upgrades, facilities and stuff in quite nice amounts;

*Feb 25, 2015* 

Development Stage: Early Access

Early Access Compitence Rateing:  9/10  -  Things were bumpy at first for what ever reasons, but things turned around quickly.   The developers never gave up despite the road bumps and updates are comeing in frequantly.   Edge of Space is a very good example of Early Access done right.

Exploration:  9/10 -  The environment can be dangerous, there's danger around every corner and you need to prepair accordingly.    There are events and outposts that keep you busy and though it is currently in an infant state of things, I can see how the world will gradualy become more and more full as time advances.

Crafting: 8/10 -  Crafting is based on xp and tends to get a bit grindy, but it's quite rewarding once you unlock new things.

Game Controls:   8/10  -  Some obvious bugs are still around, but it will not hinder the game experince too much.   Jetpacks can also go wildly out of control and some of the grapple mechanics can send your character bouncing about.

Game Play: 8/10  -  I suspect the game will greatly improve with time, but at the moment there is a limited amount of content to keep you busy, so the game becomes a bit grindy.   Again, I suspect this will change greatly in the near future.

Music:  9/10  -  The music is very fitting for the game and quite immersive.

Graphics: 8/10 -  It's gritty and retro, but also very fitting for the game style.  Some of the texture look weird, but it's a fair representation of what it is conveying.

Newbie Friendly:  7/10 - Newbies will catch on eventualy, but the learning curve is a bit harsh.  But in a good way.   It is suggested to have some platformer experince before attempting Edge of Space.  Newer generation gamers may have trouble where as older generation gamers will have little trouble with landing platforms and timeing jumps.

Community and Moderators: 9/10 -  Very few fights, healthy interactions.   Strong communication, very good staff members.  Moderation is fair and efficent and well handled.

Developers:  10/10 -  Very approachable developers, they are always happy to answer questions.   They have sense of humor and are reasonable people.   Very good company to invest your faith and funds into.

TL:DR Version:

Is it worth it:  YES!","Edge of Space pits you against the environment as you progress downward as opposed to side by side.

Als ich das Spiel sah war ich sofort begeistert!
Und obwohl es noch gar nicht komplett fertig ist spielt es sich jetzt schon erstaunlich gut!
Auch ist das Herstellungsinterface mit der Möglichkeit verschiedene Materialien für ein rezept zu verwenden sehr handlich!
Auch das Konzept: [b] Je länger du spielst, desto mehr lernst du. [/b] ist hier wirklich sehr gut gelungen!

Komme ich nun zu meinen lob und kritikpunkten.

Lob:
[olist]
[*] Ist eine gelungene Abwechslung.
[*] Gelungenenes Herstellungsinterface und System.
[*] Bietet jetzt schon viele Möglichkeiten.
[*] Bietet auf langem Zeitraum spielspaß.
[/olist]

Kritik:
[olist]
[*] Unausgeglichene Mobs. Manche Mobs teilen viel schaden aus bringen aber nur wenig EP.
[*] Rückwand abbau system. Es müsste ermöglicht werden auch mitten in Höhlen Wände abzubauen ohne vorher eine lästige Schneise ziehen zu müssen.
[*] Ep Balance stimmt noch nicht ganz. Teilweise dauert es Ewigkeiten bis man gewisse Forschungsstufen erreicht.
[*] Cryostäbe funktionieren nicht? Ich denke sie sind sowas wie extra leben falls man zu oft stirbt (siehe ecke oben links) aber sie funktionieren bis jetzt nicht?
[/olist]

Alles in allem ist es ein schönes Spiel ich freue mich schon auf weitere content updates und Bugfixes. Ich kann es jedem Sandbox Fan nur empfehlen.","[h1] Is already recommended! [/h1]

When I saw the game, I was immediately enthusiastic!
And even though it's not completely finished yet, it's already playing amazingly well!
The crafting interface, with the option to use different materials for a recipe, is also very handy!
The concept: [b] The longer you play, the more you learn. [/b] is really well done here!

Now I come to my praise and criticisms.

Praise:
[olist]
[*] It's a nice change of pace.
[*] Successful crafting interface and system.
[*] Already offers many options.
[*] Offers long-term fun.
[/olist]

Criticism:
[olist]
[*] Unbalanced mobs. Some mobs deal a lot of damage but provide little XP.
[*] Back wall removal system. It should be possible to remove walls even in the middle of caves without having to first create an annoying path.
[*] The XP balance isn't quite right yet. Sometimes it takes forever to reach certain research levels.
[*] Cryo rods don't work? I think they're like extra lives if you die too often (see top left corner), but they haven't worked yet?
[/olist]

All in all, it's a great game. I'm looking forward to further content updates and bug fixes. I highly recommend it to any sandbox fan."

Abstract translated in English:
Edge of Space is a promising heir to the 2D sanbox legacy initiated by Terraria, which introduces deep changes in one of the fundamentals of the genre: the crafting system. Having to invest your hard earned experience points in developing every single Research branch to discover their advanced recipes is both an incentive to explore the world in solo play and specialize your character in multiplayer games. There are bugs here and there, but the developers are actively supporting the game through continous patch deploying. We can't wait to see what new features will be introduced in the next updates: we'd like to see a compass that aims to your last bound cryopod or a geological probe to see what resources can be found in the area.

Commento in Italiano:
Edge of Space è un promettente erede della tradizione sandbox bidimensionale iniziata da Terraria, che introduce novità incisive in una delle meccaniche principali del genere, il crafting. La necessità di sviluppare i singoli campi di ricerca, investendo i punti esperienza ottenuti interagendo con l’ambiente, per scoprire le ricette più avanzate, aggiunge un incentivo a procedere nelle partite in solitaria e, allo stesso tempo, permette una maggiore personalizzazione dell’esperienza di gioco in multiplayer. I bug non mancano, ma le continue patch pubblicate dallo sviluppatore mitigano in parte la situazione, oltre a introdurre nuovi elementi di gameplay. Non ci resta che vedere quali altre feature verranno introdotte nei prossimi aggiornamenti: magari una bussola che punti verso la propria criocapsula o una sonda geologica per mappare le risorse presenti nell’area circostante.

There is no joy of exploration because there is hardly anything to see. 3 Biomes with the same mechanics just reskins and renames of previous resources. And a handful of pre-built dungeons instances that you can travel to, and are awful.

The combat is terrible, there are only 3 weapons that just get reskinned over and over again. And worse, they are so horribly imbalanced that you use the rifle for 95% of combat, the mortar for cheesey splash-damage-through-walls tactics on the other 5% and the carbine is completely pointless as a crappier version of the rifle.

The mechanics are clunky. You can't run down sloped tiles and jump, even though the dungeons are designed with downward sloping jumps in them. Hit detection is dodgey, enemies in certain positions can be invulnerable to direct fire because terrain hit boxes seem to register before enemy ones so your shot somehow ends up blocked by the wall behind them.

The enemies are dull. There's like 16 all told, and half of them are just reskins of the same run-at-player-bump-to-damage design with bigger numbers.

The design is darn well ass backwards sometimes too, for example: 

In the dungeon where all your digging and wall placement tools are disabled, the enemies ghost through walls. But out in the sandbox where you can cheese the mechanics, enemies are blocked by walls. Why, in the one place where you can be guaranteed the enemy NPCs can't be path blocked would you put in the world's most annoying terrain ignoring floating enemies?

You have to unlock higher tier crafting by spending experience on generic tech level up consumables and using them, and the amount of unspent experience you can have at any time is capped. So you have to stop every 5 minutes and craft more tech consumables through the laggy crafting menu or start losing out on experience. Why the heck would you try to half-ass it through the existing crafting UI rather than give it its own UI to spend experience directly? And even more why the heck would you cap it? Especially cap it so low you have to stop and spend it about 20 times to level up even one tier at later levels.

The whole game is extrodinarily grindy. Everything of value beyond the starter tiers requires converting hundreds of hundreds of junk tiles into a general purpose crafting material (Carbon fibre and super coolant). When enemy specific drops -are- needed, the same enemies drop like 10 different types of item, of which you only need the 1, so you have to farm enemies for 10x longer before you can craft one of anything. And unlocking new crafting tiers takes waaaay longer than it takes to get bored of the last reskin you unlocked hours ago.

And that's why I can't recomend this game even with furter development planned. Hardly any of the updates are exciting or ingenuitive, just more reskins called content. The design choices make no sense. And every system currently in place is poorly implemented. I have not one piece evidence the devs are capable of polish or exciting design in all these gigabytes of early access game.

They can make lots of hi-res sprites though. So there's that.","Edge of Space is in no way enjoyable in its current state. It is repetitive, bland and pointlessly grindy.

True, it is in the early developmental stage and there are a plethora of bugs, incomplete items, and overall balancing issues that still need to be worked out. 
For a game still well into its beta, i find it damn impressive that it wants me to keep playing as much as it does. 
Gameplay is not as smooth as i would prefer, e.g. no invinicibility frames upon taking damage, enemies ridiculously hard to hit with guns, having a ceiling on the max amount of ammo you're allowed to have for everything besides phase weapons. In all honesty, I felt that Terraria handled the ammo situation for projectile weapons very well, where you could have as much as you wanted as long as you had inventory space. Reloading of course is something they didn't incorporate but the upper limit on ammo makes projectile weapons nearly obsolete. Haven't tried energy weapons yet, hope they are better, otherwise its sticking to phase weapons forever just because of ammo constraints.
Mining can be tedious, as i have not found any new ores or reasons to mine besides the fact i need resources to farm xp from the enemies flying around, and your upgraded picks dont seem to be digging that much faster. 
Dungeons on here are very exciting to explore, i was amazed when i first discovered the headhunters dungeon, and again when i found maps to other dungeons as you went lower. 
Transportation mounts, like the raptors, can't teleport with you to different command nodes, which i found to make them  not very useful since you get to them so much later in the game and need to move around between your main base and hub bases quickly. 
random events that happen are interesting, they are usually pretty tough, although the rewards are severly lacking. Kill x/x monsters and you get a couple blocks of some ore thats not very rare? not worth it.

They've implemented a skilling system, where you repurpose dirt and mud etc into experience data which you then use to level your skills up in order to unlock new weapons and armor. Its a little complicated for those who just came from the simplicity of Terraria, but you catch on pretty quick.

Its a little unbalanced, but what can you expect from an early access game? I say if you liked Terraria, you'll probably like Edge of Space a lot too, but you'll want it when it comes out fully. The world's a little too big, with not enough to do, and the Arctic Biome is really dangerous, but again, I'm expecting these things will be expanded on eventually.

Final verdict: Currently not nearly as deep and immersive as Terraria but has INCREDIBLE potential to become an even better game.

9.5/10 cant wait for the released game


8/14/15 REVIEW UPDATE

Sooo... im not exactly sure what the devs are doing to make this game better. So far they've managed to slow down the engine, make the controls more buggy, add some unneccessary new looks, increased the loading time, and made NPCs. Instead of trying to add icing, cherries, and candles, they need to finish baking the cake first. It's been a long time, and the game seems to have only gotten worse, and while they appear to be ""finalizing,"" their core game mechanic is horribly broken, and they've fixed things that didnt need to be fixed, and they've broken things that were working just fine six months ago. Not to mention trying to ""balance"" the game by making it slower, harder, and more annoying to get traction; they've increased the learning scope. In general I'm noticing way more bugs than a while ago.

On the plus side, they've automated the annoying crafting process, but so far that's the only good thing i can see.

Final verdict: I still have hopes for this game, due to my love of Terraria, but frankly it's dwindled quite a bit, and if you're looking for a Terraria clone, you'll find something that throws away everything that made Terraria fun, and added stuff that made it annoying and buggy. DEVS IF YOURE READING THIS, PLEASE FIX THE BASIC STUFF, like MOVEMENT, GUNS, and THE FRICKEN TARGETING OF THE LASER PICK, before moving to things like CREATURE SKINS, MISSIONS, QUESTS, GRAPHICS etc. Make the game playable before you make it pretty.

Let's get the obvious out the of the way: it's in Beta. There will be changes. There are glitches. Boo-hoo. 

Pros:

 It's engaging, especially compared to the garden variety of miners and crafters out there. There is a multifaceted approach to crafting that requires both raw materials and the know-how of a specific skill to be able to craft. Science Points (SP) are awarded for everything - killing baddies to laser-punching dirt - and are used for increasing skill levels in broad categories such as Base Construction (BUILD BIGGER CHESTS!) to Utilities (MAKE STRONGER LAZERBEAM!) to Consumables (WHO NEEDS CRYORODS ANYWAYS?). Once your skill level is increased you can then craft a better item for yourself! Enough on crafting.. 

Enemies! They're gorgeous! They're varied! They kick my ass =( They have weaknesses that make it an engaging combat game beyond point-and-click. Angles of attack, parabolic arcs, and reload times all need to be taken into consideration when fighting the local floral and fauna. Build stronger weapons! Fight bigger baddies! Get more SP! Build Data from SP into building better weapons! Rinse - repeat - pwn. 

Dungeons!  Just when you think you've found it all - suddenly you're platforming through a mega-dungeon fighting off mechanical brains with well-timed plasma rifle shots! Loot Loot Loot Loot. 

More dungeons!  Did you know penguins like pre-marital sex and Daft Punk? Play this game to find out why. They're promiscious. And deadly. More Loot! Why do I need all these brain stems? SCIENCE!

Cons: 

It's in Beta. Lighting sometimes shits itself - sometimes there's no shadows at all! Hitboxes have been off before - but appear to have been patched. Nothing gamebreaking that I've run into with my 38 hours. 1/2 the world isn't filled in yet - but I'm sure it will be amazing when it is! There's more than enough to explore as is. 

The only gripe I have is lack of map - but it is a planned implementation, and I'm sure will be here soon. It's a large and confusing world - even with teleportation available you still get your ass lost. 


OVERALL GRADE:

WOULD BUY AGAIN / 10 

I give it a solid 8.5 - with the possibility to be a 9 or even 10 when all the bugs are worked out and content is added. The time I have put into  it should say enough. As a fan of Minecraft and Terraria - both Vanilla - the Edge of Space more than meets my expectations and is my current crack.

[strike]Finally Early access done right.

Regular updates, it already got two different huge biomes !
Devs are posting regularly in the steam forums.
This game remembers me of an insane mix of metroid and terraria.
Your an astronaut and embark on a mission to reclaim and terraform a split up planet. The deeper you get the more radiation you will discover so dont forget your protection !
Of course you can setup your outpost and craft all shiny furniture. You can research different armor sets and weapon types like phase and projectile weapons. It got even nice upgrade mechanics like improved health , deploying mini turrets or even a grappling hook !

Now you say what ? Only 2 biomes and terraforming isnt implemented yet ? With terraform i mean turn the land into a more livable space with less radiation and hostile creatures. Base building you can do from the start!
Dont fool yourself the biomes in EOS work much differently than compared to terraria. Terrarias biomes are rather small and can be traversed quickly. But on the other hand EOS's biomes really feel vast and huge. So those areas really invite you to explore and discover new lifeforms and alien buildings :)

Basically the end end goal upon release is to turn the planet back into a livable space with oxygen etc. But terraforming is a future feature.

I think in the past 2 months this early access title did do huge steps in the right direction. I was just on a server now and got disconnected. So i was confused, but actually they pushed an update right now ! So those devs are really crazy with the updates. For example the christmas update included 2 new dungeons , 1 new boss, 1 special event and several new items to craft.[/strike]


TL;DR
Basically its a blend of 2d metroidvania and terraria. Ranged combat is a huge deal with many rifles and laser guns.  Each crafted weapon can get different stats and clip sizes etc.

It maybe starts slow and you need to get used to the crafting and research mechanics, but im sure after 4-5 hours you feel right at home :)
[b]But take notice Win Xp is NOT supported !
Mac and linux arent supported yet, but get a future implementation! [/b]
Just check out the forums to get a better picture whats going on.
When starting the game first time i strongly recommend doing the tutorial first.

I bought this game awhile ago back when it first game out on steam and recently noticed it in my library, I decided to try it out again and look into the history of the game because it is abandoned. After playing for awhile I can only describe the game as one thing:

[b]A gemstone in the rough.[/b]

The interesting floating island generation, structures, and interesting creatures all bring back that initial feeling of wonder and exploration you normally lose after playing sandbox games for a long time, or playing many sandbox games.

The storyline is basic, but the NPCs that you can talk to aren't too bland or cliche, which is refreshing.

Pretty much all of the gameplay elements feel well thought out, such as the XP/Research system, questing, and dungeons. 

Soundtrack is also nice.

[b]The thing that sets this game back however, is the lack of polish.[/b]

The UI and controls are a mess, which takes longer then it should to get used to, and I never really got used to them in the end.

The tutorial isn't really gradual, but rather if you want to learn to play you need to sit through a bunch of tutorial videos and text that are in the a ""Help"" screen.

Combat is underwhelming, you mostly kite enemies with your jetpack and shoot them or use melee when your energy runs out. There is no way to dodge or negate damage.

I feel that if this game was picked up again it could stand up to the likes of Starbound and Terraria, but that is merely a pipedream at this point.","tl;dr Game is probably worth about 5-10 bucks due to how unpolished it is; buy it on a sale which usually sells it as 3 dollars or so.

It is still an ""ok"" game and fun to play for a few hours though.

Since I first started playing EOS I have noticed a ton of improvement.  The game gets regular updates and the devs are very involved with the community here on Steam.  One thing I really enjoy about EOS is the multi-leveled crafting.  Each resource is needed from the start to the end, so I don't feel as though I'm waisting my time gathering dirt, mud and rock on the way to the more valuable resourses.  You unlock new crafting opportunities by earning XP.  With this XP  you can ""buy"" data.  The data (once you get enough) gives access to better equipment.  I really like this system, I'm hoping that this is the one the devs settle on.  
There are a few frustrating things about the game, such as the amount of time required to gather resourses for the equipment you need to progress.  Also, much like Terraria, the player is super vulnerable at the start of the game (this can lead to much frustration for players not accustomed to this type of game). The issue I struggle with the most is the lack of direction in the game.  The crafting is so much fun, but I have no idea what certain resourses are for or how some of the better equipment is crafted.  If you get too lopsided with buying data from one or two catergories you will be totally lost.  Make sure you unlock the data evenly to avoid any problems.
In conclusion, I totally recomend EOS.  I remember being frustrated as hell when playing Terraria after it first came out, but as time went along and I slowly learned new things the game became really fun.  I am 100% convinced that EOS is offering the same type of experience, who knows, maybee it will be even better than Terraria when all is said and done.","Edit: 6/15/2020: I do encourage you to read my original review...and while I am not changing the recommendation-I do want to let people know that the devs quickly tucked tail and ran after the game came out.

Edge of Space ist der kleine Gegner von Terraria, aber mit etwas mehr Tiefgang.
Wie der Name schon erahnen lässt, spielt EoS irgendwo im Weltraum auf einem fremden Planten und es geht, wie auch in Terraria, um überleden. Zu anfang nimmt euch ein kleines, aber gutes, Tutorial an die Hand und zeigt euch die bis dahin wichtigsten Aspekte des Spiels, danach werdet ihr auch schon auf einem Planeten ausgesetzt :D.

Pros.
- die Atmosphäre des Spiel ist sehr dicht
- Grafik und Animationen passen zum Spiel bzw. zum Gameplay
- Gegnervielfalt und Landschaft sind sehr schön gemacht
- Gegenstände, massig Gegenstände.....
- Crafting ist einfach und selbsterklärend......

Cons.
- ....aber auch ziemlich zeitaufwendig
- manche Gegenstände erst auf den zweiten Blick sinnvoll
- Gegner sind am Anfang sehr stark
- abbauen der Ressourcen dauert gegen Anfang recht lang


Fazit:
Edge of Space ist keine einfache Kopie von Terraria, aber es fühlt sich an manchen Stellen an wie ein AddOn zu Terraria oder ein Teil 2. Trotzdem muss ich sagen macht mir das Spiel sehr viel Spaß, vielleicht gerade deswegen.
Also, wenn ihr Terraria liebt und auf der Suche noch etwas vergleichbarem seit, Edge of Space ist dann vielleicht genau das was ihr sucht. Gebt dem Spiel eine Chance, denn die hat EoS verdient.

PS: Die Updates kommen in guten Abständen und die Verbesserungen machen sich auch bemerkbar (ist ja nicht bei jedem Early Access-Spiel der Fall)

Grüß und viel Spaß beim zocken Sword","Short review of ""Edge of Space"":

Edge of Space is Terraria's smaller rival, but with a bit more depth.
As the name suggests, EoS takes place somewhere in space on an alien planet, and, like Terraria, the goal is to conquer. A short but good tutorial guides you through the most important aspects of the game so far, after which you're dropped off on a planet :D.

Pros.
- The game's atmosphere is very dense
- The graphics and animations fit the game and gameplay
- The enemy variety and landscape are beautifully done
- Items, tons of items.....
- Crafting is simple and self-explanatory......

Cons.
- ...but also quite time-consuming
- some items only make sense at second glance
- enemies are very strong at first
- mining resources takes quite a long time at the beginning

Conclusion:
Edge of Space isn't a simple copy of Terraria, but at times it feels like an add-on to Terraria or a part 2. Nevertheless, I have to say I really enjoy the game, perhaps precisely because of that.
So, if you love Terraria and are looking for something similar, Edge of Space might be exactly what you're looking for. Give the game a chance, because EoS deserves it.

PS: The updates come at regular intervals, and the improvements are noticeable (that's not the case with every Early Access game).

In my previous review I stated how bad this game was and how it seemed to be going nowhere. It felt amateurish and pointless. The tutorial was vague and taught very little.

That was at the beginning of the year and I recently reinstalled the game to see what was new and if things have improved. I'd like to talk about these changes after some brief gameplay:

The first impression that I got was that the tutorial is way better. They aren't always necessary for this kind of game, but before I was baffled on how to build things, now I know. Immediately you are given a gun, fairly weak, but it does the trick, whereas before there seemed no way to kill enemies other than using the mining laser on them or the plasma saw or whatever it was.

So what do I think now? Alot better, my hat is off to you guys for improving upon a royal mess. Not perfect, but still not released. At this rate of improvement I am confident, however, that things will get ironed out.

Some minor problems:

For some reason the install for a game of this type and look is enormous. 1.5 gb download and 3gb disc space. Where it all goes, I'm unsure, but as the art seems to be bitmap and bitmap has large file sizes, I'm inclined to think that it is that.

Screen tearing is quite bad.

Bloody snails pushing me around. Probably by design but annoying.

The worlds seem extremely small. Could perhaps do with you being able to go to other planets or at least make the worlds alot bigger.

Overall, my opinion has swayed. I see potential in this game and I am impressed with the improvements. Keep up the good work.","Updated review from my last one.

I highly recommend this game, for a range of reasons. Perhaps most importantly, it is actually fun to play. I was initially dubious, since I am new to this genre of game, but, at the behest of a friend, I decided to give it a chance. I am very glad that I did, because flying (even for short distances) with a jet pack is all that I hoped it would be. I am still waiting for my real-life jet pack, universe! 

As I have never played this type of game before, it took me longer than the average person (I assume) to get through the tutorial. This was not, however, because the tutorial was not well-structured. In fact, it taught me all the basics I needed to know for this game without much superfluous fluff. I just had trouble with, for instance, remembering that I could jump down platforms. 

In addition, it is clear from the regular patches and updates that the developers are highly invested in making the game-play experience as bug-free and enjoyable as possible. This is the first early access game that I've purchased, and thanks to my positive experience with Edge of Space, I will be taking my chances on other early access games in the future.

Ein Grauenhaftes Spiel aber irgentwie spielt man es dann doch...

Die Ui ist so Attraktiv wie Windows 3.1, beispielsweise sind Dialogfenster einfach nur große        Rechtecke hätte man einfach schöner gestalten können aber sie erfüllt ihren Job.

Das Craften und die Techstufen sind relativ unübersichtlich.

Verbot des Jetpacks in Headhunter Dungeon ist ein Krampf, da die Engine nicht drauf ausgelegt ist. Das Springen an Schrägen  treibt einen in den Wahnsinn. 

Es gibt nur 3 biome(Startbiome/Dschungel,Arktis,Wüste) + 4 Dungeons(2normale und 2 Feiertagsdungeon mit towerdefense) + 3 Boss Gegner. 
Ein Teil der Gegner ist einfach nur häßlich, andere haben wiederum ihren Charme. (Headhunter als Negativbeispiel und Pinguine und Polarbären als positives Beispiel)

Dinge die mir gefallen haben waren die Fahrzeuge bzw Reittiere + Npc System.

Fazit wer noch nicht Terraria, Starbound oder Darkout kennt sollte sich lieber diese Titel zulegen bevor er hier zugreift und in den meisten Punkten enttäuscht wird und wer nicht genug von 2d Crafting Spielen kriegen kann wird diesen Titel ebenfalls in sein Portfolio aufnehmen.

Ein weiteres Manko ist das Charaktermanagement, man muss für jeden Server einen neuen Charakter erstellen, bzw. umständlich außerhalb des Spiels Avatardaten mit dem Host austauschen.
Sorry da erwartet man einfach mehr im Jahr 2015.

 Da man schlechte Spiele spielen muss, um die Guten schätzen zu lernen ^^","""Edited version after the game left the EA phase.""

A terrible game, but somehow you still play it...

The UI is as attractive as Windows 3.1. For example, the dialog boxes are just large rectangles; they could have been designed more beautifully, but it does the job.

The crafting and tech levels are relatively confusing.

The jetpack ban in Headhunter Dungeon is a pain, as the engine isn't designed for it. Jumping on slopes drives you crazy.

There are only 3 biomes (starting biome/jungle, arctic, desert) + 4 dungeons (2 normal and 2 holiday dungeons with tower defense) + 3 boss enemies.
Some of the enemies are just plain ugly, while others have their charm. (Headhunter as a negative example, and Penguins and Polar Bears as positive examples)

Things I liked were the vehicles and mounts + the NPC system.

In conclusion, anyone who isn't familiar with Terraria, Starbound, or Darkout should get those titles before buying this and being disappointed in most aspects. Anyone who can't get enough of 2D crafting games will also want to add this title to their portfolio.

Another drawback is the character management; you have to create a new character for each server or exchange avatar data with the host outside of the game, which is cumbersome.

Sorry, you just expect more in 2015.

Because you have to play bad games to learn to appreciate the good ones ^^"

The averaging out of the reviews say the general feeling on this game is mixed, but the top reviews are nearly all absolutely positive, 
Whereas for Starbound, the general feeling is listed as very positive, but the top reviews are nearly all absolutely negative.
Why?
Because a game that was more polished at release with less attention from the developers (Starbound) is just isn't as good as a less polished game with more developer attention (EoS). This is why Edge of Space is in my favourites and Starbound is not.
Yes, this game DOES need more everything: content, detail, variety, bug fixes, polish, et cetera. But in the same volume, it is RECIEVING what it needs! DEVELOPER ATTENTION!! It warms my heart to see devs responding to reviews and comments and implementing changes based on community feedback~!

There are, however a few small issues I can think of which would address immediate issues.
- Some method of pausing the action
- an option to reverse the scroll for the hotbar
- Beautiful as the background music is, possibly a touch more variety would be welcome
- changing the tiles the master cryopod sits on would be fantastic for base decoration.

On a side note, I purchased the standard version of the game, and then later decided to buy the special edition, but none of the special edition content shows up at all. If it hasn't been implemented properly yet, I'm willing to wait, but I just want to ensure that this isn't simply a bug.

Overall, this game truly lives up to what the developers have claimed, and is improving every day. Keep up the good work devs, you love your game and we love you for it!

Edit:
Sadly, this game seems to have stalled. What could have been a very promising game has hit development hell and it does not seem to be changing that anytime soon, being incomplete and still essentially alpha for a full release.

It's obviously a work in progress so there are things that are in flux and there are tweak issues (finding particular types of elements), and what feels like a memory leak (not confirmed yet...the last hour was getting laggy and warping, but the twelve previous hours ran perfectly).

I admit I was slightly cautious about picking the game up for months because the art seemed a bit ""fuzzy"" (not as crisp as some of the other similar games), but didn't seem that way when playing...maybe it was an impression I got from early gameplay videos.

Gameplay is close enough to Terraria that you won't be totally lost; though there are a lot more items to craft and there's more of everything.  The variety of weapons and the distinction of the armor, etc, are a plus.

The world is alien and more broken up than Terraria...morea bunch of floating islands, some of which are quite large.  I haven't played it enough to distinguish layers and there is some environmental damage mechanic which resulted in the odd death when going to far down but is still a bit mysterious in its workings.

Monsters and combat are more complex and interesting.  One thing I find interesting is that somethings are neutral under certain conditions and then hostile in others (sleep mode?).  You will often be in a situation where you have to decide how you will engage because indiscriminate shooting may aggro otherwise neutral beasts or plants that will jump in your combat and make your day really bad.

There is a bit of silliness, but so far the majority of the game plays pretty straight...just had the occasional polar bear with jet boots thing but otherwise seems staple scifi.

So yes, I would recommend if you like this type of sandbox game and are willing to do your own research rather than have everything spoonfed in one guide.

<Note:  Reservations below are describing the current gameplay experience I am having.  They are just things to note and may be addressed tommorow for all I know.  On the whole, I am enjoying the game and look forward to seeing it get the polish that will really make it shine.>

My main reservation is that, especially in such a ""complex"" type game with many concepts and crafting being such a main component, that documentation is sparse.  Of course documentation is one of the last things put in a game but even the community is really light in consolidated guides (at least in English...there are other language guides that may be more fleshed out).  This isn't a reason to not pick up the game but it will get a lot easier to play when you don't need to troll forums for basic game info (ie: what are dungeons, what do you need to go there) or how do you upgrade weapons.

Other more minor reservations include ""Hmmm, I build this item and put it in my base...just what does it do again?  Perhaps pop up tooltips for placed crafting stations or maybe an intergrated icon to jog the memory.

Ladders, or other ways to go UP besides jump packs.

Some sort of ablative heat shield/air bag for when you jump into an abyss that is many screens deep.

In the crafting menu, have another grouping ""misc"" for all items that don't fit under weapons or base items or any of the other crafting subgroupings, so that when you want to craft something you don't need to scroll through the ""all"" category to find it.

An interface to show you what items you can make in list form all on the screen at once (and the ability to hide items that are outdated).  Sort of a tech tree at a glance.

The ability to choose how long info stays on screen before disappearing, and the ability to configure what is displayed.  IE:  I don't need to know xp as it accrues, but I would like to know when I ding a level in crafting what new recipies I had without looking through the browser.

I assume XP bar fills and you get no more?  If so, maybe some sort of on-screen alert so you know to burn that XP instead of wasting time doing things with a full bar.","I've put about 13 hours into it at this point, and I'd say that it's definitely worth it at the current sale price.

There is a bit of silliness, but so far the majority of the game plays pretty straight...just had the occasional polar bear with jet boots thing but otherwise seems staple scifi.

So yes, I would recommend if you like this type of sandbox game and are willing to do your own research rather than have everything spoonfed in one guide.

<Note:  Reservations below are describing the current gameplay experience I am having.  They are just things to note and may be addressed tommorow for all I know.  On the whole, I am enjoying the game and look forward to seeing it get the polish that will really make it shine.>

My main reservation is that, especially in such a ""complex"" type game with many concepts and crafting being such a main component, that documentation is sparse.  Of course documentation is one of the last things put in a game but even the community is really light in consolidated guides (at least in English...there are other language guides that may be more fleshed out).  This isn't a reason to not pick up the game but it will get a lot easier to play when you don't need to troll forums for basic game info (ie: what are dungeons, what do you need to go there) or how do you upgrade weapons.

Other more minor reservations include ""Hmmm, I build this item and put it in my base...just what does it do again?  Perhaps pop up tooltips for placed crafting stations or maybe an intergrated icon to jog the memory.

Ladders, or other ways to go UP besides jump packs.

Some sort of ablative heat shield/air bag for when you jump into an abyss that is many screens deep.

In the crafting menu, have another grouping ""misc"" for all items that don't fit under weapons or base items or any of the other crafting subgroupings, so that when you want to craft something you don't need to scroll through the ""all"" category to find it.

An interface to show you what items you can make in list form all on the screen at once (and the ability to hide items that are outdated).  Sort of a tech tree at a glance.

The ability to choose how long info stays on screen before disappearing, and the ability to configure what is displayed.  IE:  I don't need to know xp as it accrues, but I would like to know when I ding a level in crafting what new recipies I had without looking through the browser.

I assume XP bar fills and you get no more?  If so, maybe some sort of on-screen alert so you know to burn that XP instead of wasting time doing things with a full bar."

It's like Terraria in some ways, aside from the content. (It has Terraria content in it, but that isnt my point.) Terraria and EoS have similarities, and those similarities are:

- 2-D
- Plot (This more relates to Starbound's plot, but its the basic idea.)

Those are the only similarities I can see right now. They have differences; many, as a matter of fact, and some of those differences are:

- EoS has people with longer legs
- EoS has no servers as far as I know of
- EoS involves spaceships

There is one thing I would like to change, although people may disagree with what I want changed, and that's ok, but you may as well continue looking. That one thing I want them to do is:

Reduce complexity; this game is a bit too complex. It has a good plot, and it has a good start, but it's too complex to do. Of course, I only just started this game, but it would help if you made it simpler, and easier for players to grasp control of what they can do.

На мой взгляд игру надо рассматиривать как террарию в sci-fi мире, и в отличае от большинства отзывов на мой взгляд игры очень похожи. Основной проблемой явлеться высокий порог вхождения и практически отсуствие информации в интернете. Если про террарию уже все разжевано тот тут приходиться до всего доходить самому.

In my opinion, the game should be viewed as Terraria in a sci-fi world, and contrary to most reviews, I think the games are very similar. The main problem is the high entry barrier and the virtual lack of information online. While everything about Terraria has already been explained, here you have to figure it out yourself. For example, I spent an hour trying to figure out how to create and remove walls (you have to press tab when a regular block is selected (to place it) or a beam pickaxe (to mine a wall)). Even with Early Access status, the playability is quite decent, but bugs and crashes are now common not only in Early Access. So far, the project has left a positive impression on me, but it's more difficult to understand than Terraria."

November 28th, 2014

Picked this up during a sale. I own Terraria and Starbound but the latter left me burned with it's launch and follow through by the developers, but this isn't about that.

I'd been interested in Edge of Space for some time and had it on my Wishlist for a couple months before finally picking it up. A quick look through the history of the games shows I missed some of the blunder years the game held and am playing it after a UI and tier revamp so I can't comment on anything prior to the date above.

The game looks good, though I wish there were more customization items for characters, the style they've presented works well and I had no probably playing my marathon session of the game these past 2-3 days (17 hours) and the music is pretty darn good as well. Normally I listen to my own music collection during these types of games but I left the background BGM on and didn't grow to hate it. 

The controls are smooth as well and how you can move is really limited to your gear and how well you can control your jet pack, using weapons can be tricky sometimes however. The game has a few different weapon types in its starter tier from the basic automatic rifle, sniper rifle, and mortar launcher. I've found myself using the sniper rifle and mortar exclusively. You have unlimited ammo but there is a reload timer but that's not why I don't use the automatic, the main reason is damage and difficulty hitting enemies. I played exclusively in a local hosted server with friends and there were times were you can't hit an enemy due to their size, movement, and shots just passing through (most likely due to the server lagging) so we found more success with the area damage of the mortar and taking the risk with the sniper rifle.

Crafting is pretty extensive as well. There are three armor types and many branches of crafting to ""skill up"" by using Science XP gained from mining, crafting, and hunting monsters (which is the best gainer later on) and unlike Terraria and Starbound the dungeons aren't found in the world but you rather transport to them after gaining enough coordinates to get to them. Once you enter the dungeon the rules change, you can't use your mining laser or jet pack. Having these taken away really changes how you go against an enemy as you now have to time your jumping and can't block or tunnel away from an enemy (or through a stage) and personally I feel is nice change. Unfortunately I haven't seen the dungeon boss yet as during the dungeon we had problems with the game failing to load or players games blanking to grey in the dungeon.

Overall however, I am really pleased with the purchase and look forward to future updates with the game. It does have a learning curve and some of the UI elements are weird (I've hit escape hoping to clear a open menu more times than I can count, it doesn't work) but overall at it's current stage it's fun and playable.","Updated February 5th, 2019

Ok, So I have seen some users complain of the developers abandoning their game, this simply is not true. Now whether this is based upon Starbound (the developers are Chucklefish and have no affiliation with Handyman) it really is unfair to everyone working on Edge of Space.

So, what am i doing with this post? Im going to show you through my own experience and time with the game what it looked like when i started playing around januraryish up to now. Yes there will be two or three videos going to my youtube channel, No you are not asked to subscribe, like, etc this is purely for those that are looking for things that were added to the game and just general gameplay. 

First off, were going to talk about where it was when i started. It was a barren game, not too much content. Few enemies and a fair amount of bugs. The intro screen was also completely different to what you see now. The music however is the same. Below is the first comparison video you dont need to watch much to get the gist. A lot of features are not there, The zoom that we have now, All the enemies you currently see, the headhunter dungeons are not there, the trees are stiff and there are not as many armours, weapons, and in general crafting stuffs as there are now.

There are things however i did not count on ever being in the game such as assault bears (big bears with giant ♥♥♥♥ guns that shoot you) Anomalies which are random such as a mob of powerful creatures that will obliterate even the most well trained and armoured ArkCoNaught.

The starting zone is now a much tougher place full of stuff to kill and explore rather than an empty almost lifeless planet. That is not abandoning of a game.

Keep in mind the game still needs fixing and updating as it is in early access/beta at this moment.

Terrariaヒット後に雨後の竹の子のように登場したクローンの一種なのですが、terrariaのロゴが入ってなんか特別感を出してる感じですがシステム的にも全然関係無い感じが凄くする
StarBoundがある以上SF版Terrariaともいい辛い
ちょっと大きめのキャラなんかはいいんですが、どうにもシステムに疑問が残ります
Terrariaとはコンテンツなんかは比べようが無いのですが、このクラフトのリサーチシステムはうまく行ってるとはどうにも思えない
簡単に言えば経験値をためてクラフトするアイテムのカテゴリを開放してレシピを出していくのですが、カテゴリごとの開放でカテゴリの内訳がわからないのでほしい施設やアイテムがどこにカテゴライズされてるのかわからない
適当に次々開放していくには延々土堀や雑魚退治等の大量の経験値稼ぎをしなくてはならず単調になる
そもそもまだコンテンツが足りないため進展自体も単調気味なので輪をかけて地味な感じになる
同じTerrariaクローン系でもDarkoutなんかはキー素材入手でリサーチが一気に開放の流れで、新しいアイテムを手に入れると一気にテンション上がるんだけど
リソースの入手難度や必要数もこれが正解とも思えない
MAPもラピュタのような空に浮かぶ島というか巨岩群とちょっと目新しい感じなのに、左右に狭く開始地点がMAP上限から始まるため下に掘り進めるしかないので「あっちこっち好きなとこ行ける」感も無い
でもでもこのゲーム非常にアップデートの頻度が高く、今までもバンバン変わってバンバンワイプされてるのでなんかの拍子にいきなり面白くなりそうでもあります
今はまだお勧めしづらいけど期待は持てるんじゃないでしょうか

追記
v1.04現在、以前つらつらと書いてたクラフトリサーチ系の欠点はかなり解消されてます
おかげでかなり遊びやすくなり、ちゃんと進行を実感できるようになりました
初っ端から異様に硬く素早く大量に出てくるMobなんかも改善され、武器もそれなりに強いのが追加され、やたらレアだった素材の入手率や入手量もバランスが取られてますし、コンテンツの追加も沢山行われてます

なんせここの開発さんはこのゲームが大好きみたいでとにかく頻繁にアプデやFixを入れてくれますので好感が持てます

ただ相変わらず進行が一直線なのと（これは逆にわかりやすくていいとも取れ、多分開発さんはそちらを重視されてるのでしょう）、絶妙に悪い操作性はなんとも変わってないです
これJetPack（このゲームは最初から飛べます）をWキーにしてくれたり、レーザートーチの効果地点をStarBoundみたいなカーソル位置にしてくれれば改善されると思うのですが
また、銃のリロードが撃ち捨てオートリロードのみで能動的に出来ないなんてのはいくらなんでもありえない（しかもリロードが異様に遅い）
他にもプラズマトーチの照明範囲狭すぎね？って事とか、もうちょっとインベントリでかくて良くね？って事とか、ちょっと進むとなんかもうマジかこれってくらい難しくなったりする事とか、まあまだ言い出せば色々出てきますが、確実に良くなってきてる実感はあります

グラフィックのセンスがちょっともっさい感じがするのはもう逆に好きなので私的に＋です","This is a difficult decision to make.
It's a kind of clone that popped up like mushrooms after the Terraria hit, and while the Terraria logo gives it a special feel, it feels completely unrelated in terms of the system.
With StarBound already available, it's hard to compare it to a sci-fi version of Terraria.
The slightly larger characters are nice, but I have some doubts about the system.
The content is hard to compare to Terraria, but I just can't see how well the crafting research system works.
To put it simply, you accumulate experience points to unlock categories of crafting items and get recipes, but unlocking each category makes it hard to understand the breakdown of categories. So I don't know where the facilities and items I want are categorized.
Unlocking them one after the other requires endless digging and defeating small enemies to earn a ton of experience points, which becomes monotonous.
To begin with, there isn't enough content, so the progression itself is a bit monotonous, which makes it feel even more dull.
Even in other Terraria clones, like Darkout, you unlock research all at once by obtaining key materials, and you get excited when you get a new item.
The difficulty of obtaining resources and the number required don't seem right.
The map is a bit novel, with a floating island in the sky like Laputa, or rather a group of giant rocks, but it's narrow on both sides and the starting point is at the top of the map, so you have no choice but to dig down, which makes you feel like ""Oh, There's also no ""I can just go wherever I want"" feeling.
But this game is updated very frequently, and it's been constantly changing and being wiped out, so it feels like it could suddenly become interesting at any moment.
I'm not sure I'd recommend it yet, but I think there's hope.

Addendum
As of v1.04, the shortcomings of the crafting research system I mentioned previously have been largely resolved.
Thanks to this, it's become much easier to play, and you can really feel your progress.
The mobs that appeared in large numbers, were unusually tough and fast from the start, have been improved, reasonably strong weapons have been added, the acquisition rates and amounts of materials that were previously extremely rare have been balanced, and a lot of content has been added.

After all, The developers here seem to love this game, and they update and fix it frequently, which I really appreciate.

However, the progression is still linear (which can be seen as a good thing because it makes things easier to understand, and I think the developers probably prioritize that), and the controls are still incredibly poor.

I think this could be improved by making JetPack (which you can skip from the beginning of the game) the W key, or by changing the laser torch's effect point to a cursor position like StarBound.

Also, it's just not possible to reload a gun without actively firing and auto-reloading (and the reload is incredibly slow).

Other things I've noticed are that the plasma torch's lighting range is too narrow, isn't it? Wouldn't it be better if the inventory was a little bigger? It gets so difficult once you progress a little, and I could go on and on about anything else, but I definitely feel like it's getting better.

I actually like the slightly clunky feel of the graphics, so this is a plus for me."

I understand this game is still in beta, but in it's current state I'm not a fan. I definitely see the potential of this game and can forsee it being a really fun and addictive game like Terraria. Right now it's just frustrating. Especially since this game has been out in beta for over a year and the feel hasn't changed. It's sad when 3 of my friends and I can't stand to play this more than an hour every 3-4 months we try it.

Many items that you find early in game have absolutely 0 use or in the item details it shows ""Will be updated in the future"" or some nonsense. The inventory feels clunky and can be buggy when swapping things in and out of your actionbars.

For those of you who played Terraria, if you enjoyed the helper dude being there to somewhat guide you in the right direction you're going to have a harder time. The beginning gives you a brief sense of direction but then it's gone. To understand what a lot of things do, you must either spend lots of time trying to figure it out on your own or look it up on the wiki.

While I feel games do need to have a little but of challenge in them, I'm not sure the start of this game goes in the right direction with that. Your mining tool is painfully slow. Your starting weapon is painfully weak. Materials needed to upgrade anything are way high. You also have lives in this game. So as you're digging down trying to find some sort of material you need to make an item you have no clue what it does, you come across some crabs that take 15 shots to kill with your weak gun and they kill you. You've spent 20 minutes digging, lost a life, and still have 0 of the material you need.

The soundtrack is nice. Which is one thing I expected after playing Terraria and Starbound. Visuals look good for the most part. The gameplay just has a long way to go until I feel it will be fun.

If you want a new Terraria style game, go pick up starbound instead. You'll be completely satisfied! Maybe in another year I can say the same about this.","This is a review in it's current state.

20го ноября вышло довольно крупное обновление - систему прокачки основательно перетряхнули, как и многое другое. И тут я понял что меня наконец то затянуло =)

Да, очень многое ещё не допилено. Да, ещё встречаются баги. Бета тест, как никак.
Я таки рекомендую, так как впечатлён скоростью разработки: мелкие обновления чуть ли не каждую неделю, крупные примерно раз в месяц.

On November 20th, a fairly major update was released – the leveling system was completely overhauled, along with many other things. And then I realized I was finally hooked =)

Yes, a lot hasn't been finalized yet. Yes, there are still some bugs. It's a beta test, after all.
I still recommend it because I'm impressed by the speed of development: minor updates almost every week, major ones about once a month.
At this rate, EoS has every chance of approaching Terraria's playability in a year... maybe we'll see.

Not worth it in it's current state. This was my first ""early access"" game before I even know what EA was, I unfortunately fell for the trap of some cool trailers and the incorporation of some Terraria elements, making me hope this was a Sci-Fi terraria.

It lays out the very basics which you then shortly forget and feel very lost in the coming gameplay moments. 

Building and equipment progression seems confusing and not very straight forward, it's difficult figuring out where to get some of the less common materials without just randomly digging and hoping to hit a vein and what exactly you should be building next. Unless they aren't implemented yet, the distinct biomes are non existent. I walked a bit away from my spawn point and jumped down a few ledges and started taking environmental damage. I presume this is a barrier to prevent you from digging a hole straight down (a-la terraria) and gathering the best materials within minutes of starting a new game.

Building and equipment progression seems confusing and not very straight forward, it's difficult figuring out where to get some of the less common materials without just randomly digging and hoping to hit a vein and what exactly you should be building next. Unless they aren't implemented yet, the distinct biomes are non existent. I walked a bit away from my spawn point and jumped down a few ledges and started taking environmental damage. I presume this is a barrier to prevent you from digging a hole straight down (a-la terraria) and gathering the best materials within minutes of starting a new game. 

I'll update when the retail version is released but at this time I won't be spending anymore time with this game."

I do enjoy the idea that all the fighting (for now) is with guns rather than melee. It is hard to get used to because enemies are smaller and fast but you get better over time. 

The game itself has just had a UI overhaul and progression is being changed up right now. I have no fear that this game will turn out to be bad in any way. The team listens to us and makes great decisions on their own as well. 

I have been part of some rough early access games (Warz :( , The Stomping Land :((  and Starbound :-\ ) so I have had my share of ups and downs. Edge of Space has kept me even, while I want the game to be done I am not demanding them. I know they are working on everything and it will be great no matter what. 

I originally came to this game because Starbound was updated and it killed a connection to a mod that made the game fun. (survivalist mod) Obviously starbound is so easy, no challenge at all. This game is actually much harder and makes you feel the need to be careful and play safe at times.

Tldr; Buy the game. Best case scenario you love it and have a new game to play. Worst case scenario, you find out it's not for you and you can just get a refund.

Pros : 
Toooooooooons of content
A much needed optimization (went from 25-30 to 60fps)
Easy to set up multiplayer as long as you know what you're doing
3 seperate tech trees for armor and 3 seperate tech trees for guns as well as a tech tree for melee.
Every tech tree has 15 layers/ranks
Armor looks unique and pretty
Introduction of nests that can be taken over (nice challenge at the start of the game)
3 bosses already in the game with more planned for the future
Sound effects sound great, especially for the weapons
Overhaul of world generation. No longer are titanium, ice, and other ores rare in the first phase of the game. 
Game promotes a natural progresion in that exploring, digging, and fighting will all give you exp you can put towards tech 
I really really like this soundtrack (thanks, Lori)
Different types of weapons feel different. Phase are weak but infinite weapons, projectile are strong but very limited, and energy are strong but require you to decide between using them or using your jetpack since they both use the same energy.
Wide range of enemies and great for people who like making very technical bases (with logic gates implemented and an easy to use power system)
Funny loading screens to help pass the tedious but necessary parts of every game

Cons :
Weapons are a little hard to get used to and are sometimes hit and miss. Like with any game release, it has its fair share of bugs
After the tutorial with Fineous, it's kinda hard to know what to do next
Over abuncdence of snails and frogs can get annoying.

Game doesn't feel as grindy as other people make it out to be. I don't find it to be too gindy since there's always a lot of things to do.

Повелся на известное имя Террарии и купил. Теперь вот голову не покидает мысль на что еще я мог бы потратить эти деньги. 
   У игры хорошая, проверенная другими концепция. Копай, строй, крафти, сражайся, вот только почему-то не цепляет. Обновления выходят часто, но лучше не становится. Дело в том что при всем желании играть в Edge of Space попросту не удобно.
- Художественное оформление режет глаза, хоть анимация и хороша.
- Есть стрелковое оружие, но враги ни как не реагируют на попадания.
- Есть пещеры и тунели, но найти в них что-то кроме смерти трудно, игра скупа на ресурсы.
- Крафтинг изначально доступен не весь, нужно выбивать специальные улучшения которые будут открывать вам новые рецепты.
- Интерфейс сделан абы как и до сих пор не пофиксили. Он приклеен к экрану намертво, каждое окно открывается отдельной кнопкой и закрывается только ей, нажатие esc приведет к паузе но не уберет окошки. Выбирать вещи на хотбаре можно с помощью цифр но не колесика мыши и я не уверен что кнопки для хотбара можно переназначить. Вещи можно использовать только из хотбара, если нашли рецепт то нужно сначала воткнуть его туда, потом выбрать и использовать.
- В игре есть джетпак, но взлетает он не охотно, как будто притяжение на планете под 5g хотя прыгает персонаж довольно высоко.
- Мир генерируется случайно, но очень однообразно и нелепо. Куча островков которые обрываются и не понятно, есть ли там внизу земля и долго ли до нее падать.
- Карты нет, как ориентироваться не понятно.
   Вывод: разрабы придумали интересную игру и сделали все что бы вам не захотелось в нее играть. Не говоря уже о том что это калька со Starbound которая в разы удобнее, больше и красивее.","[This is an old review for the old version. I haven't played the new one yet.]
I was hooked on the well-known name of Terraria and bought it. Now I can't stop wondering what else I could have spent that money on.

The game has a good concept, proven by others. Dig, build, craft, fight, but somehow it doesn't grab my attention. Updates come out frequently, but it doesn't improve. The fact is, no matter how hard I try, Edge of Space is simply not comfortable to play.
- The art is jarring, even though the animation is good.
- There are ranged weapons, but enemies don't react to hits.
- There are caves and tunnels, but it's hard to find anything other than death in them; the game is stingy with resources.
- Not all crafting is available from the start; you need to earn special upgrades to unlock new recipes.
- The interface is poorly designed and hasn't been fixed yet. It's glued to the screen, each window opens with a separate button and can only be closed with it. Pressing esc pauses the game but doesn't remove the windows. You can select items on the hotbar using the numbers, not the mouse wheel, and I'm not sure the hotbar buttons can be remapped. Items can only be used from the hotbar; if you find a recipe, you first have to insert it, then select and use it.
- There's a jetpack in the game, but it takes off reluctantly, as if the gravity on a planet is under 5G, even though the character can jump quite high.
- The world is randomly generated, but it's very monotonous and awkward. There are tons of islands that drop off, and it's unclear whether there's land below or how far it's going to fall.
- There's no map, so it's unclear how to navigate.
Conclusion: the developers came up with an interesting game and did everything they could to make you not want to play it. Not to mention that it's a carbon copy of Starbound, which is much more convenient, larger, and prettier."

Both tools and weapons are poor in perfomance!

Nope! To upgrade anything, It takes amounts of various materials, not to mention:
-the time to mine them (is slow)
-search for them (too much time)
-you have to walk FAR to find more, go into holes and a maze of caverns, making you lost from your outpost.
-limited area (that radiation thing that kills you when you go too much down)
-enemies stronger than you (and weak weapon)

And if you fail for the first time, you will notice you actually got lives!
YEAH! LIVES! Who puts lives on a game based of Terraria?!
But you can make more ""lives"", but you will have to decide on what to do next! 
Spend your materials in making lives and search materials so you can upgrade your weapons, armor and tools, but you will end up lost, surrounded by enemies, and you will eventually will die. Then, you must do more ""lives"" so you don't lose your progress!

The controls are nonintuitive, the interface feels too small and crowded, and currently the game feels like a bad Terraria clone. Your money would be better spent on Starbound if you're interested in this theme.

EDIT: Just went back and played through the tutorial after several months. Everything looks and feels the same. The game is as cumbersome as ever and I did not enjoy trying to get started playing.

I don't know if I'm supposed to play this game with a wiki page open, telling me step by step how to play it all the way through or not. I will admit that Terraria and Starbound have you basically playing with the wiki open as well, but Edge of Space seems to offer very little encouragement when you actually get into the game. Upon exiting the tutorial I was beamed down to the surface of what I assume was a planet, and immediately attacked by floating jellyfish who took a frustrating amount of time to kill. I was given no actual objective, only tossed forward into this environment with very little explaination.

Bottom line: I would not recommend edge of space to anyone.

So... but Im very interested in this game, cause you can do so much things and it  remember me on terraria.


This game needs more balancing and brain.
Some things are really complicated -> to do stacks are very stupid, split things OR create items like ""torch"" u need 

but I still love this game and everybody out there TRY this game out and play ""longer"" you need a longer time do understand the games logic, but when you reached the knowledge about the game its AMAZING.


Great job Update this game more, use ideas from other people and think about.
I know also its hard as a developer ""to do"" things what they want.

Этот продукт не рекомендуется для покупки, даже для любителей жанра.

К соновным недостаткам отнсятся:
1) Адовое сочетание цветов всех уровней и планов. У кого голова болит, у кого глаза. 
2) Необоснованно усложненный интерфейс и геймплей.
3) Отсутствие достаточного числа внутриигрового контента.

Маловероятно, что когда-нибудь это продукт станет играбельным.","The guys are late with their creation. Since it's a flat platformer, they should have released it in a decent form before Starbound. Basically, that's what they did. They made a killing in that gap and apparently decided to slow down all development.
This product is not recommended for purchase, even for fans of the genre.

The main drawbacks include:
1) The terrible color combinations across all levels and planes. It's a headache for some, and a pain for others.
2) The interface and gameplay are unnecessarily complicated.
3) Lack of sufficient in-game content.

It's unlikely that this product will ever become playable."

As such, I tried my best to look beyond the horrifically clunky and unhelpful user interface, the occasionally slightly janky graphics and the various spelling mistakes, grammatical errors and so forth...  And, for a while, I did.

Unfortunately, what lay underneath wasn't all that great.  Yes, being able to ""fudge"" resources and use one thing in place of another is nice, but you can't combine two different types and the drop-down list bugs out if you have too many candidates.

But then we get to the matter of the actual tech tree and what you're building with all this space junk...   The game praises its ""unique, Borderlands-style procedurally generated weapons"", but all this means is that rock gun 1 may have +2 minimum damage and +1 clip size, while rock gun 2 has considerably less of either but 15 more accuracy (note, I have yet to discover what, if any, effect ""accuracy"" actually has on anything.  It certainly doesn't do anything with the projectile spread) and a different abstract ""quaility"" [sic] rating.  And between the three first tiers of weapons, with a really vast difference in required resources, there was only a tiny upgrade in regards to damage and clip size.  All other stats were pretty much the same, and they all looked like so much jumbled bulk.

There's no smooth progression, as all tech is unlocked by picking up and consuming data bricks that get dropped randomly by enemies.  Yup, you're gonna have to shoot a LOT of electric jellyfish before you can build that kitchen counter you always wanted.  You'll also need to do a spitload of grinding to get all the metals you need for anything beyond just dirt guns and mud armor, because ore veins are very rare and often stupefyingly dangerous to go near.

Speaking of danger, this game incorporates a life system.  It's not game over once you reach 0, but if you die after that all the items in your tragically small inventory will get expunged onto the surrounding terrain.

This game is early access, VERY early.  It's fully possible it will shape up in time, but right now it's clunky, incredibly grindy and half the items in the tech tree are obscenely expensive and serve no purpose.  In closing, I figured out how to infinitely duplicate any resource in the game before I managed to work out how to split a stack in two.  Wouldn't recommend in its current state.","I came to Edge of Space expecting a lot, having heard so much about it in relation to Terraria and Starbound.

From what I have read, there is alot of nit picking over what is a really early access title that, even after two years, is STILL being worked on constantly. Jump in, help out with the progress of this game, and enjoy the glorious Science!"

It's a very simple premise, but somehow, as of this writing, the game doesn't quite deliver on either its potential or the intellectual legacy of Terraria, which great effort is put into establishing.

The first thing to realize about this game is that there are some really cool ideas!  You've got a laser drill, and you start with projectile weapons!.  The graphics are a miss for me (I'll get into why later), but are certainly more detailed than Terraria's, and may not be as offensive to another gamer's eye.

(The following edited as of 21 May 2015...)

The game has vastly improved since my playthrough last year!  The general user experience is far less irritating than it was, and actually warrants my giving this game a chance now.

[b]What Works[/b]
The game's crafting system is awesome.  Pretty much, the game is already similar to the ""Terraria Leveled"" mod in some ways mechanically, but the research lines are well-defined, and the experience amounts required to unlock a tier feel correct.  What's more the amount of things you can craft without a crafting station is great for upgrading your field arsenal (from what I've seen so far.)

They fixed the guns to always hit.  This was [i]the[/i] dealbreaker for me before.  Thank you.  Note to other game developers: in an action game, RNG-based miss mechanics are [b]very very bad[/b].  What's more the base tier of stuff after completing the tutorial is [i]actually useful[/i], which is nice!

Speaking of the tutorial, it appears simplified from the version I played earlier, and is effective at basically teaching the game.  Less was indeed more!

You can rebind keys.  This helps to mitigate some of the confusing keybindings in this game, and let you play Your Way™.

[b]What Doesn't Work[/b]
First, you still spawn on a sky island instead of the planet's surface.  I think this is a mistake, even with jetpacks being available immediately, because jumping into a void beneath your little sky island is too much of an early risk, that I don't think a new player wants to take - at this point, we're still getting a feel for the game and the world.

Second - re-evaluate your default key bindings.  V for crafting and C for character are really counterintuitive to me.  While providing rebindable keys is nice, nailing a good preset will help this game immensely.  It was irritating to have to click the menu button every time I wanted to craft something, until I found the hotkey.

Speaking of crafting, the way you spend XP feels [i]incredibly[/i] clunky, and the increment/decrement textfield used to implement it clashes with everything else.  Since the upgrades are straight lines, not trees, why not just allow me to click an upgrade or a button on the upgrade in order to ""buy"" it with the XP?

The visual style to me is hit or miss, but this gets into personal preference; if Terraria is a Saturday-morning cartoon, then this is [i]Archer[/i] on Adult Swim, which is what I think they're going for.  This point may or may not be a sticking point for you; this ""Doesn't Work"" bit is purely subjective.  Some sprite mods or the ability to create sprite/tile image mods might be a good idea, though.

[b]The (New) TL;DR[/b]
Once, I did not recommend this game; it wasn't ready for the public.  Luckily a few patches seem to have come and gone to help resolve that situation.  The developers need to study up on good User Experience (UX) quite a bit more, and take it as a lesson learned going forward - UX seems to be one of their weaknesses that they have to fight against.  However, the interesting ideas in this game seem significantly closer to fruition.

11959408,english,2014.08.02 21:09,❌,❌,0.8417320848,147,"***I will retain the original review here, but I will add and mark new points. If  you want my most up-to-date review, scroll down.***

I'm going to be completely honest; there's a lot of potential here and I hope it reaches it, but so far I'm just not seeing it. I'm trying not to be too harsh, I respect the dev team and their game, but here are my impressions...

    The first thing that comes to mind with this game is; There's alpha games, and then there's ALPHA games. While I play a lot of games in alpha and beta stages, I usually enjoy the experience because they often bring something new and innovative to the table to make them interesting. Sadly, I'm just not seeing it with the alpha of this game. There's little that I would consider standout, innovate, or unique. The mining lazer is cool, but not groundbreaking, and mindnumbingly slow without any upgrades in sight. At the very least, it should have the option to heat the targeted rock and at least one sqaure of the rocks around it at a slower rate. This would speed up the process while still allowing precision. Jetpacks are cool, but the limited energy and energy regen followed by blind jumps makes them more frustrating than anything. If nothing else, the early jetpacks could use a massive buff until more is added and that situation is sorted out strictly for exploration purposes. Beyond those two features, the game doesn't have much to offer.

    My next gripe is the actual game's goal and layout. The game gives you the goal of terraforming, and that's about it. I really didn't like that goal. I don't feel like it's a goal at all. Terraforming is just something you DO in this kind of game from start to finish. I don't feel like something I'm going to be doing anyways -and can do at any point- should be my final goal. It gives little to work towards other than ""look I mined out this rock lol."" If my goal is to terraform, than I want to be given a final idea of what I'm terraforming towards, rather than just changing the landscape slowly. Which brings me to my other argument; the real ""goal"" players give themselves is simply going downwards. I feel like the only way to progress is to mine resources and then continue falling downwards in hopes of new discoveries. There's also multiple levels as you fall downwards, resulting in higher risk areas. This is great and all but then why terraform anything on the top levels if the better resources and more interesting stuff is downwards? Why even set your roots and your house at the top just to work your way back down and farther again? I'm not trying to be harsh, I just think some good thought has to be put into these concepts before the game moves forward and falls flat on its face.

    I'm hoping that my investment, and the investments of everyone else gets put to good use here. I think somewhere in this alpha is a great game, but right now it's barely in a playable stage. It's just very unsinspiring when compared to the games everyone, myself included, will immediately pin it to- being Terraria and Starbound. Both of those games have unique and recognizeable art, music, gameplay, and attitude. Even the art in Edge of Space feels cluttered and weird and just like it needs to have its own personality to it. I will say that I love the music at the opening menu though. 

    Closing thoughts; I don't regret supporting this game and I hope it continues getting support so that it can become a full-fledged competitor with other similar games, and hold a meaningful spot in a steam library. That said, until the game brings proof that it's serious and has something to prove to the gaming world, I wouldn't recommend putting coin into it to have it gather dust in your steam library.


*** As of Jan. 30th, a few months after original review

    Well I'm not entirely sure I can list everything they did, but the devs are pulling through on this one. With some UI overhauls, and massive variable tweaks, even the initial few minutes feel much more active and fluid than before. The progress curve is much more obvious right now and you have to work towards your progress points individually. Exploration is a bit easier now as jetpacks have recieved decent buffs, nulling my earlier complaint about them. Also mining has been considerably buffed, with an early ""overcharged"" mining lazer now available that damages at least 2 layers of blocks at a time. So my mining complaint is decently nulled. There's a bunch of other tweaks/buffs that improve fluidity of gameplay including changes to weapons, monster health, so on so on.

    My initial impression before was that the game was an unplayable wreck and I was a bit disappointed in it. Right now my impression is that I can really start to get into this game. Although I feel it's a bit lacking in overall content right now, yaddayadda it's an alpha, we've been here before. It could just use a bit more... Variation? Maybe just several different sprites for the wildlife or something. The sights get a bit repetitive at the start. I haven't moved too far in yet as there is quite a lot of grinding involved now. 

    All-in-all I'm refraining from saying I recommend this game just yet. While it has shown significant improvement and I feel like the devs have listened to complaints and worked to better the game, I'm still not ready to recommend this game. I'm going to see if the devs are still dedicated to improving the game and adding content, and if they seem committed and the game starts to come together I will change it to recommended in a heartbeat.","***I will retain the original review here, but I will add and mark new points.

If you're a fan of Terraria, but want something a little more bizarre, and more focused on space, this is definitely your game. Don't see it as Terraria or Minecraft knock-off, though. This game is one of the most unique games of this type that I've seen. Most notably, the crafting system. The way this game's crafting system works is just fantastic. Rather than picking around for specific blocks, you are able to craft things by finding blocks to fit the requirements for density, permiability, and other criteria for creating an object. There is more to this, but I'd rather let you find that out for yourself, as there are many machines in this game that would take a while to fully explain. 

As you can see the graphics in the screenshots, and audio in the trailers, I'm not really going to dive that deep into them. The only thing I'd like to note is character creation. There is at least a moderate amount of customization for your character off the bat, and even more when you consider vanity and armor further in the game, so if that's the type of thing you're into, consider it another plus. 

This game isn't completely great though, and I won't be able to stress enough that this game is EARLY ACCESS, and that's what you're paying for. A lot of it isn't done. There are bugs and glitches (though not really anything that will ruin the experience).

I have really high hopes for this game, and I believe it has a lot of potential. I really look forward to seeing this game out of early access."

You start out in a game with a spawn point and are given lots of blueprints to activate then craft.  Where I get pretty annoyed and usually give up is the whole downward scrolling aspect of the game.  To reach the first 'layer' of a surface, you need to drop down,  which requires building stairs back up to the initial block of dirt you spawn in to presumably build your starting base.   

Getting back to the whole verticle scrolling aspect of the game.  Going up and and down all the time requires building lots of stairs and frequent use of your jetpack.  The problem is, it recharges extremely slowly,  resulting in a lot of time just waiting to use it.   Lighting is also trickier than in other survival games:  there's a few flareguns and torches to be placed,  but they all require using the crafting menu,  which is tedious. For example, to craft an item you need to select the materials you want to use first,  sometimes there's a huge list of materials you need and if you are missing one, you'll have to re-select all of them again if you want to try and craft again.   A lot of the time you'll find yourself in the dark trying to climb out of a pit of some sort, and hope you don't accidently fall further downwards to certain doom.

Speaking of tedious,  everything just feels tedious to me about the game.  Mining is about as exciting as watching blocks smoke from heat before turning into collectable ores.  Crafting requires dragging a blueprint to your inventory slots, selecting the slot,  holding left click to activate the blueprint,  then right clicking the inventory slot to remove the blueprint.  This is just a typical example of how something is done in this game and honestly I don't feel like any of it is as intuitive as it should be.   

Combat is also pretty sleepy.  You shoot enemies,  and they die.  There's no real weight to the combat and it's just not very gratifying.  

Overall tho, the game does feel solid as I say.  Personally I just fall asleep trying to figure something out,  but that's just me.  Many will find the game appealing because there is much to do and there's a lot of content,  so if the aforementioned things don't bug you, feel free to dive in.","Don't get me wrong the game is solid already,  but even at this point early access,  the base game just doesn't feel very involving.

The big drawback for this game is the user interface (which is so bad that I gave up after less than an hour, hence the lack of play time). At its current condition, the UI is far too complex and spread out to be used effectively. There's something like 5-10 different 'windows' that you can bring up, each with their own UI's and submenus, all of which the player must navigate in order to effectively play the game. Did I mention that the windows can only be brought up by hotkey, and have no onscreen hint as to which hotkey brings up what?

Compare this to similiar games such as Starbound,  Terraria and Minecraft, which are far more streamlined in terms of UI. Starbound is the most complex out of the three, but even that has only a couple of ""main"" user windows - the inventory/equipping/status menu, and the crafting menu. Minecraft has a similar setup, with a combined inventory/equipping window and a crafting window, plus some other assorted windows depending on gameplay style. Terraria has only one ""window"", which is the inventory/crafting/equipping/status overlay that is accessed via the escape key.

The graphics are ok, and the gameplay is nice, but unless the user interface gets a rework, I wouldn't recommend playing this game - you'll be stuck navigating windows, menus, and submenus half the time.","Note: This review is only for the game as of 8/2/2014

Explained below:

The problems i have with this game are: 
The crafting and exploration (lower sections of planets) are gated by long and tedious kill grinds for skill ups. 

I cant explore lower in the earth until i get better armor, i cant get better armor until i get more skill ups, i cant make a generator to use some of my other craftables until i get more skill ups, i cant make a different cryopod so i can spawn in my base when i die or come back into the game because i dont have enough skill ups to make one.

So far ive only see around 5-6 resources in minings: dirt, clay, mud, biomass, uranium, aluminum. These of course are refinable to other resources but none of these resources are currently usable because the schematics that use them are not unlocked yet. Of course there may be more kinds of resources, but i cant go lower in the earth to find out cause the armor i need to do so, i cant make. 

So currently if i want to play the game, im stuck killing crabs with my nerf gun until i get enough skill up chip things to make them, and with the current skill level it takes about 40 or so of the same type to level up, and they only drop one per of one type and there are around 6 types.

When I returned to it, I was surprised. The game had changed dramatically, from the interface to the tutorials and the streamlined crafting process. While I wouldn't call it a complete failure, it was definitely less polished than other 2D side-scrolling sandbox games, and I found it uninteresting. But not anymore. I'm definitely enjoying it.

Pros:
Amazing graphics, sure there is better, but the graphics amplify the futuristic feel of the game rather then the classic 8-bit.

Kind playerbase, I have been to many a server on EoS and only 1-2 of them have had a non-userfriendly community to come along with them, but those that do i mostly delete from my server list.

Understanding Devs, unlike most early acces games, EoS has devs who always respond to complaints and try to fix them. Most of what usaully turns me away from early acces games is the devs forget about the players after a bit and turn the game into a money grab for them, but thankfully Eos's devs show no sign of doing so. (thanks guys)

Addictive gameplay, EoS has a feel that you have to keep on going to the next thing, boss after boss, domain after domain. 

The fact that you have categories instead of a specific item being needed for every recipe. In my opinion, this really helps because you can swap clay for dirt for mud for rock etc. This helps because you dont have to grind your way through the world looking for specific resources.

It has a story, unlike most games (except starbound) this game follows a story that explains why you are randomly stuck on a planet with a cryopod as a respawn point.

Cons: As of 9/19/15 i cannot think of any cons

The advertising video is a complete lie: 9/19/15 edit: not anymore!!! the trailer pretty much sums up the gameplay (congratulations to the devs for finnaly completing it)

The sections of the research list (my hotkey is L) of Experimental armor, Assualt armor, and Recon armor: 9/19/15 edit: no longer relevant =x

Also you cant get structure blocks for a base until a few hours in: 9/19/15 edit: FIXED: can get this almost immediately after creating the world

Almost forgot to mention the tiny damage of the starter gun: 9/19/15 edit: FIXED ;D starter gun is now has fair damage and guns are easier to craft Good Job Devs","I have a split review about this game, (9/19/15 edit NO LONGER SPLIT) so below you will find my pros about EoS.

I was going to leave my old review below to compare, but Steam has a character limit so I didn't. Consider this first paragraph a big fuck-you to whoever implemented a character limit ON REVIEWS.

Now, the actual thing.

First I want to acknowledge issues I had previously that have been fixed, the foremost of which is the ability to craft better weaponry. The devs clearly listened to their player community on this one, replacing the old system with a way of generating research data and using THAT progress to create better guns (and better everything else as well!) 

The ridiculous placeholder drops on the second biome flora have been replaced with the real deal, and though I suspect it took me about as long to get there as the last time (seeing as I have neither x,y coordinates nor a map nor my old world to reference for comparison) I found the trip less crappy for having a weapon that can KILL THINGS. This is a major improvement over the last attempt.

Some of the new tools available include better saws and picks. THANK YOU, DEVS. THANK YOU SO MUCH! Being able to mine -quickly- makes generating both resources and science xp (used for science) much, much faster and more reasonable to accomplish. I am also fairly certain that either the costs of chests (in terms of aluminum) have gone down or the availability of aluminum has increased: either way, THANK YOU AGAIN. Early game resource management sucked the last time, much less so now.

Combat got more fun. This is partly due to the fact that I CAN KILL THINGS NOW because my gun NO LONGER HAS TRAINING WHEELS. Seriously, I cannot say enough how this particular change makes the game better (and I also cannot say enough how confused I am that the old loot % system was used AT ALL before, eminently terrible as it is: good change is good). The enemies feel overall a bit less the same, and I genuinely live in terror of those little blue bugs in the second biome. Guh.

Now for the less cool stuff.

Screen shake. Cool effect, but this (like controller rumble) should always have an off switch. Making it non-optional is excessively lame to your players.

Weaponry NEEDS a key that reloads it that is NOT shared with another function. Maybe the R button? Just a thought.

Disabling jetpacks in headhunter temples. This is kind of awful, honestly. I have the entire rest of the game to get used to using my jetpack to maneuver, only to have to change my reflexes in the more challenging parts? Where I would dodge basically without thinking before, here I am forced to remember a change in play that IS NEVER PREFACED while in the middle of genuinely tougher combat. Let the player use the tools you've given them in game. Let them think laterally. Don't feel like you need to take away one of the most fun parts of your game to add ""challenge"": execution challenge isn't satisfying. Depth challenge is satisfying. At the very least give some warning about the change beforehand.

Weapon customization needs to happen. When reload times are long, a mod to make them shorter is muy bueno. When ammo counts are small, a mod to make them bigger is muy bueno. Not having this sort of thing to replace the old random weapon stats system? No bueno.

Tl;dr, The changes I've seen are massive, and merit me changing from a not recommended to a recommended. Way to go, game devs! You guys genuinely fixed things that were broken, and what I'm seeing now is much, much more enjoyable than when I bought it. High hopes, guys.","EDITED AS OF VERSION 0.3765, 3/31/2015

Dieser Vergleoch ist nicht in jeder Hinsicht hilfreich für Edge of Space, denn was Steuerung und Spieleinstieg angeht, kann es mit den Konkurrenten zur Zeit noch nicht mithalten (Das Spiel ist aber auch Early Access und daran wird noch viel gearbeitet - jeder Patch ist ein Schritt in die richtige Richtung). Wenn man Edge of Space nur 20 Minuten Zeit gibt, seine Pracht zu entfalten (wie es eineige Rezensionen hier getan haben), dann wird man nicht viel Freude daran haben. Die Charaktere wirken steif (die Animationen sind wirklich mäßig), das Tutorial ist langatmig und die wirklich wichtigen Informationen musste ich mir aus Video-Tutorials und Wikis holen. Da haben die Entwickler noch große Schritte vor sich um das alles zugänglicher zu gestalten. Das Problem dieses Spiels ist aber auch gleichzeitig seine Stärke. Denn viele Spielelemente haben einfach mehr Tiefgang als bei Terraria und co, sodass sie besser erklärt werden müssen. Das Gefühl von Fortschritt ist meines Erachtens nach deutlich besser als bei Starbound. Man kann und muss alle gefundenen Materialien raffinieren um sie zu besseren Items zu craften. Bereits früh im Spiel beginnt man mit Elektrik in der eigenen Basis zu arbeiten (alles was ich bisher dazu gesehen habe, wirkt so, als könnte man damit im späteren Spielverlauf richtig komplexe Energiekreisläufe herstellen um seine Basis zu verteidigen). 
Ich finde, wer Terraria gespielt und gemocht hat und wem Starbound noch nicht reicht, der sollte Edge of Space ruhig mal eine Chance geben. Man sollte ein bisschen Geduld und ein ordentliches Wiki mitbringen, dann kann man (auch zusammen mit Freunden) wirklich Spaß mit Edge of Space haben. Und wem das nicht gefällt, der sollte sich das Spiel vielleicht zu Release mal ansehen. Bis dahin haben die Entwickler sicher an der Zugänglichkeit und dem Spaß gearbeitet.
Was definitiv nicht stimmt ist, dass die Grafik viel schlechter ist, als bei Starbound, alle Vordergründe und Hintergründe sind handgezeichnet und ordentlich in ihrer Qualität. Gerade die Hintergründe fine ich schöner als bei Starbound.","In many ways, Edge of Space probably has to accept comparisons with Starbound and Terraria, as it essentially belongs to the same genre. This comparison isn't always helpful for Edge of Space, as it can't yet keep up with its competitors in terms of controls and ease of entry (but the game is also in Early Access, and a lot of work is still being done on that—every patch is a step in the right direction). If you only give Edge of Space 20 minutes to unfold its splendor (as some reviews here have done), you won't get much enjoyment out of it. The characters seem stiff (the animations are really mediocre), the tutorial is long-winded, and I had to get the really important information from video tutorials and wikis. The developers still have a lot of work to do to make everything more accessible. But this game's problem is also its strength. Many game elements are simply more profound than in Terraria and the like, so they need to be explained better. The sense of progression, in my opinion, is significantly better than in Starbound. You can and must refine all the materials you find to craft them into better items. Early in the game, you start working with electricity in your base (everything I've seen so far seems like you could use it later in the game to create really complex energy circuits to defend your base).
I think anyone who's played and enjoyed Terraria and isn't quite satisfied with Starbound should definitely give Edge of Space a try. You need a bit of patience and a decent wiki, and then you can really have fun with Edge of Space (even with friends). And if you don't like that, maybe you should check out the game when it's released. By then, the developers will have surely worked on making it more accessible and fun.
What's definitely not true is that the graphics are much worse than in Starbound; all the foregrounds and backgrounds are hand-drawn and of decent quality. I find the backgrounds, in particular, nicer than in Starbound."

11324385,english,2014.06.20 02:32,❌,✅,0.501480639,1,"This game is marketed like as a clone of Tererria. This is only partially true. I really like Tererria, but I don't like this game. I understand that this game is still in early development, but based on what I have seen so far it is headed down the wrong path. 

1. Everything is much bigger in this game. The character is bigger, the blocks are bigger, everything. This means you cannot fit as much of the game on the screen at a time, so you cannot see as far.

2. There is no map. I use the map all the time in Tererria to find my way around and locate resources. One of the things I like about the map in Tererria is it shows open areas near you, so you can dig towards them. Since this game does not have a map it also does not have this ability. Finding resources is extremely difficult. I have spent hours digging around and ohly found very limited usable resources. Instead Edge of Space has a radar system that you have to craft, and beacons, which you also have to craft. Since it is so hard to find resources it is very difficult to find enough to make these items and so it is difficult to find your way around. Even with the radar, all you get is a little blip on a small radar screen to try and find your way around. This is so much less effective than having a map.

3. So far I have not found any hidden treasures. In Tererria treasure chests and breakable containers are a great way to get resources and gear early in the game. This game does not have these so you have to manufacturer everything yourself. This results in the game moving a lot more slowly. 

4. This game does not have biomes like Tererria. For example every Tererria map has desert, jungle, forest and ocean biomes. These go along way to add variety and keep the game interesting. Since this game does not have these it gets boring really quickly. In tererria you also have weather and other events, like blood moons and such. This game does not have anything like that.

5. Weapons suck. The only weapon you have is a gun and it has very limited ammo and has to take time to charge. This is a big pain because if you get attacked by a mob you quickly run out of ammo and have to run away until it charges back up. This makes figinting really difficult and not fun. In addition gun are not good close range, so if the enemies get close you will not be able to hit them. Upgrading the gun is also a slow process. You first have to get enough experience to unlock the plans for a new weapon before you can build it. Since gathering experience is slow it can take a really long time before you are able to upgrade.

6. This brings me to my next dislike. The experience system is completly messed up. There are 18 different categories for experience, and upgrading them depends on which items you pick up. This means you may find a lot of upgrades for furnature, but not for weapons, which has happened to me, and so you have great items to place in your base, but really crappy items to fight with. I like Tererria much better because you only have to gather the materials and you can make anything.

7. You cannot use items directly from your inventory. To use an item, even things like health and other consumable items you first have to put them in your quick bar and then switch to the item and use it. Then when you have consumed all of them it stays in your quick bar with a big red X over it. I would prefer that the item was removed from the quick bar when it was used up. Your quick bar has a very limited amout of space, only 8 slots, so you will be juggling things in a out all the time.

8. Detail screens are split up into 4 different screens. In Tererria if you hit the esc key you see your inventory, weapon, item, and vanity slots and everything else. In Edge of Space you have to hit I for inventory, V for crafting, C for armor and item slots, and L for Experience. The 4 different screen also cover each other up and cannot be moved. So if you try and drap something from the inventory to the armor slot you have to juggle the two screen and make sure they are not covering each other or else it is impossible.

9. The bug reporting system is lousy. When you go to submit a bug you fill out what looks like a standard email form with a place for your email, a subject, and a message. However it is extremely limited in that if you make a spelling mistake or want to go back and clarify something you cannot just use your arrows or mouse and go back to previous text. The only way to go back is to use the backspace key. This means you loose all your typed text up to where you want to change.

All I can say is I am glad I bought this game on sale because if I had paid more than $5 for it I would be extremely upset. Right now I am willing to wait and see if it gets better.","This game is marketed like as a clone of Tererria. This is only partially true. I really like Tererria, but I don't like this game. I understand that this game is still in early development, but based on what I have seen so far it is headed down the wrong path. 

1. Everything is much bigger in this game. The character is bigger, the blocks are bigger, everything. This means you cannot fit as much of the game on the screen at a time, so you cannot see as far.

2. There is no map. I use the map all the time in Tererria to find my way around and locate resources. One of the things I like about the map in Tererria is it shows open areas near you, so you can dig towards them. Since this game does not have a map it also does not have this ability. Finding resources is extremely difficult. I have spent hours digging around and ohly found very limited usable resources. Instead Edge of Space has a radar system that you have to craft, and beacons, which you also have to craft. Since it is so hard to find resources it is very difficult to find enough to make these items and so it is difficult to find your way around. Even with the radar, all you get is a little blip on a small radar screen to try and find your way around. This is so much less effective than having a map.

3. So far I have not found any hidden treasures. In Tererria treasure chests and breakable containers are a great way to get resources and gear early in the game. This game does not have these so you have to manufacturer everything yourself. This results in the game moving a lot more slowly. 

4. This game does not have biomes like Tererria. For example every Tererria map has desert, jungle, forest and ocean biomes. These go along way to add variety and keep the game interesting. Since this game does not have these it gets boring really quickly. In tererria you also have weather and other events, like blood moons and such. This game does not have anything like that.

5. Weapons suck. The only weapon you have is a gun and it has very limited ammo and has to take time to charge. This is a big pain because if you get attacked by a mob you quickly run out of ammo and have to run away until it charges back up. This makes figinting really difficult and not fun. In addition gun are not good close range, so if the enemies get close you will not be able to hit them. Upgrading the gun is also a slow process. You first have to get enough experience to unlock the plans for a new weapon before you can build it. Since gathering experience is slow it can take a really long time before you are able to upgrade.

6. This brings me to my next dislike. The experience system is completly messed up. There are 18 different categories for experience, and upgrading them depends on which items you pick up. This means you may find a lot of upgrades for furnature, but not for weapons, which has happened to me, and so you have great items to place in your base, but really crappy items to fight with. I like Tererria much better because you only have to gather the materials and you can make anything.

7. You cannot use items directly from your inventory. To use an item, even things like health and other consumable items you first have to put them in your quick bar and then switch to the item and use it. Then when you have consumed all of them it stays in your quick bar with a big red X over it. I would prefer that the item was removed from the quick bar when it was used up. Your quick bar has a very limited amout of space, only 8 slots, so you will be juggling things in a out all the time.

8. Detail screens are split up into 4 different screens. In Tererria if you hit the esc key you see your inventory, weapon, item, and vanity slots and everything else. In Edge of Space you have to hit I for inventory, V for crafting, C for armor and item slots, and L for Experience. The 4 different screen also cover each other up and cannot be moved. So if you try and drap something from the inventory to the armor slot you have to juggle the two screen and make sure they are not covering each other or else it is impossible.

9. The bug reporting system is lousy. When you go to submit a bug you fill out what looks like a standard email form with a place for your email, a subject, and a message. However it is extremely limited in that if you make a spelling mistake or want to go back and clarify something you cannot just use your arrows or mouse and go back to previous text. The only way to go back is to use the backspace key. This means you loose all your typed text up to where you want to change.

Doing same boring stuff for 2h just to drop one item I needed for gun upgrade. It would be OK for late game grinding for maniac players but at the start? Getting all aluminium I needed was also pretty non-exciting. I don't mind mining, I like minecraft, terraria or Starbound and all the mining didn't get me bored there. But here there is almost nothing interesting to find underground (or anywhere else TBH) and ores are sparse.

Sure it's early access - but I played many early access games that weren't that boring.


+ crafting system - every material belongs to few ""classes"", crafiting recipes often require generic materials (for example - if recipe requires raw/metal  you can use aluminium or titanium or whatever else belongs to raw/metal),

+ upgrade system - enemies drop upgrades that after use give you point in given subject (for example Armor), after gathering enough poinst you unlock new recipes,

+ interesting world concept - small and large floating islands,

+ base that actually is a base (different stations - like rafinary or w/e - need to be connected to main command center you build by blocks you craft - can't get away with dirt house)


- your first gun is shitty. It's pretty weak, you reload more than you shoot and bullets are ugly and slow flying making shooting fast moving enemies nightmare. And you won't change it fast (after 6h of playing I managed to upgrade it to a bit less shitty gun that still looks and behaves similar). I loved how guns ""felt"" in terraria (speed, sounds, power), here basic gun is terrible, it feels like shooting from plastic toy and you are stuck with it for long time.

- I met only few types of enemies so far. Jellyfishes that suck your energy, small crabs that are freaking hard to hit with basic gun, flying brain-tentacle-thing that shoots at you and some kind of... errr... something that fires homing balls of death that get you through walls (and are hard to shoot down). And there were no ""Hordes of enemies"", usually just few of them at same time (and more would get you killed)

- upgrades are pretty random, I still didn't managed to discover other classes of weaponry,

- it's hard to tell how long will you fall after you jump (world consists of flying islands), you often die by falling down few screens because of missing island you couldn't land on beacues you didn't know its there,

- islands don't vary in any way,

- your pickaxe is slow (6h of play without getting a upgrade), ores are hard to find. You spend a lot of time at slow mining.

- UI is bad:

     - prompts you all the time (everytime you craft it shows you result in a window. it would be enough to show prompt only for weapons)
     - selecting stuff to craft item and amount just takes too much time
     - if you click outside inventory it will ask you if you want to throw item (again - prompt!) instead of using it. it order to use item you have to put in hotbar (annoying when building or using upgrades)

+- sci-fi feel (compared to Starbound, with is kinda mix of fantasy with sci-fi)

+- I don't like graphic style of game (but that's very subjective)

+- no swords in space (on the other hand I was begging for some melee weapon in some situations)

This all being said i'm sure these quirks and issues will be worked out, upon full release a proper review will be made. As of know, my only opinion is the game leaves me wishing there was more to it. ~Remmy"

It looks like an evolved version of Terraria and looks fun, but
it's difficult when you actually play it.

I learned the basics from the tutorial,
but maybe because it's mostly in English, I'm not sure what to do next.

I've realized once again that Terraria is an amazing game that you can get into naturally.

However, I'm looking forward to future updates. It might be even more exciting if there are Japanese mods, so I recommend it."

For an early access game it certainly shows some potential, but there are a few things that really bring it down for me.

Pros:

- I like the art style, characters/enemies/backgrounds all look nice.
- Some character customization is nice.
- Space age laser pick axe type thing with rifles to defend yourself is always promising. 
- Has a decent tutorial that I would have probably been 100% lost without. 
- I liked the quest/task system in place that was used for the tutorial. I would love to see this used a good bit in later builds of the game. Random quests/tasks/challenges while exploring the world would add a good bit of excitement for me.


Cons + personal opinions/feedback:

- The UI. Oh man the UI. This is the one thing that, if not updated significantly, will stop me from playing this game again. Every time I'd look for something I felt myself straining my eyes trying to discern exactly what I was looking at. Similar looking icons in inventory, small text in several places, and a very clunky and unrefined crafting menu (in a crafting game) made it so that every time I'd stop blasting things with my laser saw to go look at my loot or craft something I would grumble to myself a little bit about how I had to go back into the menus. I hope updates are coming for some of UI/menus, especially the crafting menu and/or system. Please oh please.

- Also didn't care for the health/jetpack meters being on such a noisy panel up in the corner like they are. It was a hassle to try and read while running/fighting anything. I would rather just have a couple of bars or numbers above my character or some such thing so that I can see a gauge while I am looking at my character and moving about.

- The [lack of] transition from day to night was so abrupt that I thought it was a bug or my game was crashing or textures had stopped drawing. Day/night is great to have, but needs to be a transition, not instant.

- It seems like the way to unlock new things to craft is by collecting these little book things that give +25 or so to various crafting skills. I don't much care for that as a gating mechanic, maybe it would be better if more was available initially or if there was a better indication of how using different materials to craft the same item would make a better one. Additionally, I really didn't enjoy that I would find these little books, then have to go into my inventory, select them, equip them on my action bar, and then pull them out and use them in order to gain experience from them. Unless they are to be used for something else I am unaware of, I don't understand why they are inventory items instead of just experience type pickups that occur automatically and scroll a nice little ""+25 Furniture!"" or something over your head.  

I should stop rambling. There's my 2 cents.

I hope some of this has been helpful if anyone's read this far. I know people compare this game to Terraria, which I have not played. It may very well be that much of what I don't like is based around Terraria's success and these elements I don't like just aren't to my tastes. If that's the case then I guess it just isn't for me - ignore all that junk above. :)

My conclusion - As it exists now, several different issues come together to make a disappointing experience. I hope that is just due to it being in an early stage, and that we'll see much more polish/improvement in the next few months. I think that when/if the right things are made better the whole game could come together quite nicely.

Пока что игра не понравилась , по сравнению с террарией .. да какое там сравнение.. , Edge of Space  как будто выкидыш инвалид, болеющий сифилисом. Террария была классная во многих направлениях , одним из главных был забавный дизайн , достаточно прикольные персонажи , забавная анимация , да и вообще цвета там блоков всяких , даже задники были сделаны супер (у разных биомов) , простые , но они подходили по дизайну и не мешали. Игра : сама по себе  была интересная , ее хотелось перепроходить. Поиграв 15 минут в Edge of Space мне  стало тошно от дизайна , совершенно идиотский дизайн( это ИМХО ) . Я не люблю аниме и всякую такую херь , а тут все выполнено в такой стилистике , терпеть не могу. Персонажи стали пропорциональные( в реальном смысле) , может это и хорошо , но они совсем не вписываются в геймплей , тоесть получается , что герои нарисованы более-менее серьезно ( не в мультяшной или Mario стилистике , как в террарии) но тогда мир совсем по стилистике не подходит , блин , трудно объяснить , ну это как если бы вы в BATTLEFEILD3 добавили героев из линяги или из какогонить такого говна , короче вещи несочетаемые впринципе , если создается серьезный проект. На счет задника : ОН УЖАСЕН , он ,я так понял,состоит из 3 слоев , которые двигаются между собой , когда герой куданить бежит , это сильно дезориентирует ,плюсом из-за того , что он очень яркий - он сильно мешает , из-за него не видно нихрена . Перестарались с этим , думаю если играть больше часа , то у вас точно голова закружится . Еще минус это геймплей , если в террарию ты зашел , то на знакомство с игрой уйдет максимум 2-3 минуты , а через 5 игрок будет уже весело херачить дерево , чтобы построить дом. Тут я долго не мог допереть с управлением , блин , вопрос , зачем делать такую тяжелую систему? Это же не сраный симулятор , как АРМА , да там дохера кнопок надо знать , потому что там дохера возможностей , но тут то в Edge of Space на кой хрен столько меню , неужели нельзя совместить инвентарь и крафт в одном меню , да даже не так , можно просто сделать крафт как в террарии , это намного удобнее. Нет тут нам надо изучать какие-то свитки или какую-то такую херь потом лезть в меню крафта , а дальше разработчики посчитали , что если они знают игру и её интерфейс , то и игроки все поймут(не тупые же) . Ну это тоже трудно объяснить , попробую , вот представьте , что Энштейн знает теорию относительности , каждый ее оспект , и вот он решил написать книгу , написал формулы в ней и стал издавать , дескать он же знает эту теорию , значит и другие поймут без лишних слов. Короче говоря , подведу всю эту ахинею к выводу : Edge of Space очень непохожа на Terraria .Если вам нравится запутанный интерфейс , дебильный дизайн(техно-модерн от дауна) , эмо-пидары (кстати поза у героя соответствующая, особенно во время смерти ) и неинтересный геймплей , то вам игра очень понравится! Удачи! Terraria FOREVER!!!!!!","Before you read, I'll let you know that the game is still in beta, and I understand that perfectly well!!! Things could change! Now that you've read my rant, you can start writing your review!

I don't like the game so far. Compared to Terraria... what comparison can I even compare it to... Edge of Space is like a miscarriage of a disabled person with syphilis. Terraria was great in many ways, one of the main ones being the fun design, pretty cool characters, funny animation, and the overall colors of the blocks. Even the backgrounds (for different biomes) were superb. Simple, but they suited the design and didn't get in the way. The game itself was interesting, I wanted to replay it. After playing Edge of Space for 15 minutes, I felt sick of the design; it's completely idiotic (in my humble opinion). I don't like anime and all that crap, but everything here is done in this style, I can't stand it. The characters are now proportional (in a real sense), which might be good, but they don't fit the gameplay at all. It turns out that the heroes are drawn more or less seriously (not in a cartoon or Mario style, like in Terraria), but then the world doesn't fit the style at all. Damn, it's hard to explain. It's like adding characters from Lineage or some other crap to BATTLEFEILD 3. Basically, these things don't go together if you're creating a serious project. Regarding the backdrop: IT'S HORRIBLE. As far as I understand, it consists of three layers that shift between each other when the hero runs somewhere, which is very disorienting. Plus, it's so bright that it's really in the way, you can't see a thing. They overdid it; I think if you play for more than an hour, you'll definitely get dizzy. Another downside is the gameplay: if you're just starting out in Terraria, it'll take you a maximum of 2-3 minutes to get to know the game, and after 5, you'll be happily hacking away at wood to build a house. I couldn't figure out the controls for a long time; damn, why make such a complicated system? This isn't a fucking simulator like ARMA, where you have to know a ton of buttons to get a ton of options. But why the hell does Edge of Space have so many menus? Can't they just combine inventory and crafting in one menu? No, you could just craft like in Terraria, it's much more convenient. No, here we have to study scrolls or some other crap and then go into the crafting menu. The developers figured that if they knew the game and its interface, the players would understand everything (they're not stupid, after all). Well, that's also hard to explain, but I'll try. Imagine Einstein knew the theory of relativity, every aspect of it, and then he decided to write a book, wrote down the formulas, and started publishing it, saying, ""Well, he knows this theory, so others will understand it without further ado."" In short, I'll sum this whole nonsense up: Edge of Space is very different from Terraria. If you like a confusing interface, dumb design (techno-modernism from a moron), emo-fags (by the way, the hero's pose is appropriate, especially when he dies), and uninteresting gameplay, then you'll really like this game!

The crafting system is very interesting: to craft the next item, you need to level up the corresponding branch, and to do that, you need to drop items from mobs. Also, the gear is created with random stats, which adds to the interest. Overall, the game is similar to Terraria and Starbound (which I also liked), but it has its own unique features.

And you cannot get everywhere you can see either: radiation exposure will keep you from delving deeper unless you craft the requisite playtime-padding gear. I get the feeling this game is deliberately padding its time so as to ration the little content it seems to have.

Except for the artstyle, this game is outdone by the much similar Starbound, even though this has been on Early Access for much longer. And we all know how Starbound turned out.

I should have learned my lesson to not trust Early Access no more. This just buries the remaining hope I ever had for such a model."

I played it, and it's a constant battle to obtain upgrade books (to increase your tech points). Not to mention the monsters are the size of rifle bullets (in-game), and their bizarre movements make me question the AI's dedication... Overall, the experience is like trying to swat a mosquito with a grain of rice. You have to fight, and it's disgusting. The ore distribution and terrain generation are incredibly weird. I really wanted to mine, but I only found three in an hour. Without any ore, I couldn't move on. And then there were those tiny monsters that attacked me. It was boring... it was just a constant collection of materials... If you want to stick with Terraria-style 2D sandboxes, wait for Terraria 2.0 or the finished version of Starbound. And the art style is not very appealing, it looks like a bunch of different things... The gameplay of this type of game is indeed the same, mining, killing monsters and leveling up, but for this EOS game, mining is uncomfortable, killing monsters is uncomfortable, and leveling up requires great patience, so please continue to wait and see, and my review will follow up when it is updated later~"

Для ранней версии выглядит вполне отлично. 
Игра вызывает большой интерес и любопытно, что же будет дальше.
Из плюсов:
- Необычный мир будто из советских фантастических книг
- Почти с самого начала появляется питомец, а это уже приятно
- Механика напоминает старые анимэ мультфильмы
- Сложновата в освоении, но это заставляет продумывать свои действия
- Приятная музыка
- Странные существа
- Особенности различного оружия
Подумал над минусами, а их практически нет.. Недоработки вполне характерны для данной версии.
Выводы: 
Покупать игру стоит и такой суммы она вполне заслуживает.
Но! Нужно запастись терпением т.к. ждать финальной версии придётся не мало.
____________________________________________________________________

Спустя полгода игру щедро обновили. Мир выглядит более естественно, интерфейс в разы удобнее, предметов всё больше.. Если сделают больше рандома, плюшек и боссов, то игра наверняка займёт своё почётное место рядом с Terraria!

Разработчики, я состарился ровно настолько же насколько и вы. Многие уже умерли не дождавшись обновлений или ответов. Ответьте на один вопрос. Вы еще живы?","Developers, please! ===>
For an early version, it looks quite excellent.
The game is very intriguing, and I'm curious to see what happens next.
Pros:
- An unusual world, straight out of a Soviet science fiction novel
- A pet appears almost from the very beginning, which is a nice touch
- The mechanics are reminiscent of old anime cartoons
- A bit difficult to master, but it forces you to think through your actions
- Pleasant music
- Strange creatures
- The unique features of the various weapons
I thought about the downsides, and there are practically none. The flaws are quite typical for this version.
Conclusion:
The game is worth buying, and it's well worth the price.
But! You'll need to be patient, as you'll have a long wait for the final version.
____________________________________________________________________

Six months later, the game has been generously updated. The world looks more natural, the interface is much more user-friendly, and there are more and more items. If they add more randomness, perks, and bosses, the game will surely take its place of honor alongside Terraria!

Das einzige was ich bis jetzt nicht so gut finde ist das Menü und das Interface, das Menü ist leicht verwirrend, bietet ausserdem kaum Einstellungsmöglichkeiten und beim Interface fehlt mir eine Menüleiste über der man per Mausklick in die verschiedenen Menüs wie etwa Crafting, Inventar, Charaktermenü kommt, die Schatten und Lichtphysik gefällt mir auch nicht wirklich, aber ich bin mir ziemlich sicher das dies noch verbessert wird, in ca 3 Tagen soll ja ein großes Update erscheinen, da bin ich mal gespannt was sich damit im Spiel alles ändern wird.

And regarding the tutorial; I found my way around right away and found the tutorial to be well-explained. It only takes about five minutes and explains the most important functions (crafting, controls, etc.).

The only thing I don't like so far is the menu and interface. The menu is a bit confusing and offers hardly any settings options. The interface lacks a menu bar where you can access the various menus, such as crafting, inventory, and character menu, with a mouse click. I don't really like the shadow and lighting physics either, but I'm pretty sure this will be improved. A major update is supposed to be released in about three days, so I'm curious to see what changes it will bring to the game.

Датакоры падают , исследований почти нет. Гда та свобода , которая была в Террарии? Ее задушили каким то не понятным статом , который дает костюм для возможности опуститься ниже.  Убивать миллионы мобов ради этого? Интерес ниже среднего. Мне кажется разрабы пытаются перехитрить сами себя или просто морозят проект ничего не делая чтобы выжать из нас побольше денег ....

But the game has been out for a year, and there's been no improvement whatsoever. The crafting is pathetic. The last patch introduced datacores that drop from mobs, which are supposed to boost research. Datacores are dropping, and research is almost non-existent. Where is the freedom that used to be in Terraria? It's been stifled by some incomprehensible stat that gives a suit the ability to sink lower. Killing millions of mobs for this? Interest is below average. I think the developers are trying to outsmart themselves or are simply stalling the project with nothing in order to squeeze more money out of us... A long-term project with no future. In my opinion, they should just make a Terraria clone instead of inventing the nonsense we have now. Someone once said, ""The best is the enemy of the good!"""

It's more detailed and realistic than Terraria, and above all, the characters are beautiful.
However, there are a lot of bugs, perhaps due to the lack of patches. The world is small, which reduces freedom, and many in-game systems are lacking.
Furthermore, the game's overly realistic nature makes it challenging and tedious.

首先，需要不停的打怪升级各类科技，然后建造各种装备和设施，但是矿确实分布不如泰拉瑞亚合理，但是还是能找到。另外就是地下有各种遗迹可以获得大量科技。因为没汉化，所以很多东西不太会用……

目前来说，可能是我不会玩？但是要凑齐一些基本的材料未免太难了点（我建立过两个世界都感觉是如此），所以进度很难发展下去的样子，我连基本的指挥中心都搞补丁，只把最最基础的各类武器和采集各种素材的器械准备齐全了，还有一堆乱七八糟的玩意，唉，花了不少时间才这点进度，着急，先放着好了……

=====================
作为泰拉瑞亚的精神续作，此游戏在中国大陆居然无人问津、甚至连一个入门的文章都没有简直太可怕连。

其实虽然是英文，但是很简单我初中级别的都打完新手教程了，不过画风真的……和泰拉瑞亚差距好大，接受起来不容易。

我刚打完新手出了飞船，荣我再多体验一番再更新，先发出来只为这游戏中文评论太少。","July 20, 2014 Update
First, you need to constantly fight monsters to upgrade various technologies, then build various equipment and facilities. While the distribution of mines isn't as organized as in Terraria, you can still find them. Also, underground, there are various ruins where you can obtain a large amount of technology. Since it's not localized to Chinese, I don't know how to use many of the items...

Currently, maybe I just don't know how to play? But gathering even the basic materials is a bit too difficult (I've built two worlds and found this to be the case), so it seems like progress is slow. I even patched the basic command center, and only managed to assemble the most basic weapons and equipment for gathering materials, along with a bunch of other miscellaneous gadgets. Sigh, it's taken me ages to get this far. So anxious, I'll just put it aside for now...

=======================
As the spiritual sequel to Terraria, it's truly terrifying that this game isn't even popular in mainland China, lacking even a single introductory article.

Even though it's in English, it's pretty easy. I even finished the tutorial at a beginner level. However, the art style is... so different from Terraria that it's hard to get used to.

I just finished the beginner level and got a ship. I'll try it out more before updating. I'm posting this now because there are so few Chinese reviews for this game."

The reason advancement isn't working is right before the steam summer sale most of the NPC code was gutted out for revamping, very similar to what Rust is doing. The team at Handyman Studios was not expecting to get featured in the flash sale and ended up receiving more orders during that eight hour period than they had gotten in their previous best week during the 2-1 sale.

The development team consists of two people, one of which had a system failure right after the change to the NPC code was implemented, which meant that what should have been fixed either right before or right after the flash sale was unable to be fixed. The chests dropping from nests is related to this issue because the nest/event has to spawn the appropriate creatures and then track that they have been killed, which with the changes to the NPC code is not working properly, so you're ""failing"" every nest/event you start.

This means that yes, at this particular moment it is not possible to progress past the first biome. With full aluminum armor you can make it pretty much to the end of the first biome, but beyond that is not possible. I will be leaving my review as ""not recommended"" for the time being due to the non-available features, but will hold my final opinion in reserve until such time as the current mess is cleaned up.","After speaking with LadyAijou extensively regarding Edge of Space.

They removed most of the enmies for a long time which was kinda frustrating as the game felt like it only had 3 enemis to kill. 

They made the world smaller and only go donwards direction which makes it really hard to travel as you cant predict if your jatpack can take it or you die falling. 

The quest are a good addition but mostly impossible as with the weapons you can get early they do 1 damage so destroying a craps nest takes so long you cant destroy it before time runs out. 
Same thing with defend defence platform, once you take the quest 8 enemies will spawn inside the defence platform and destroy it less than 10 seconds hitting it 15 dam per tick inside the platform.
Also its kinda weird that enmies that hit it are seen in the game wilderness as non damaging mobs and yes they will even hurt you even thou they should not.

The new research system takes far too long to get anything build. Even the basics. As you need to grind load of enemies to get 15-25 points in certain research gategories at random in order to advance it further which requires 1000 or more per level and enemies wont drop reserach date always when killed.

Currently for some reason you cant even build the next weapon in line as its material tables are bugged and it wont allow you to put any of the right materials in to build it.

Also the current weapon system is kinda sad as you can only upgrade your weapon and not really build more weapons jsut the one you have.

Enemies can spawn anewhere, even inside you and they sure like to spawn inside your base all the time. You need to constantly clear it out.

Enemies also tend to have so much hp that with your 1 dam pea shooter you need about 30 shots to kill one enemy and yo ueven have to reaload it slowly. Thou the weapons are made randomly if you are lucky you might get weapon with 2 dam.

The lighting day and night system is getting an upgrade soon which is a great thing but at its current state it is horid. Black boxes that dont even fade in but appear instantly when night comes. Luckily this shoul be fixed soon but its been this bad for a long time.

There are many normal alpha game buggs that dont bother me like animatiosn are the wrong way, characters spazzing out when looking up ( this will be fixed soon too =) ), etc cant craft things, de-sync at servers, etc.

The developers are very active and have improved this game alot thou sometimes things have gone the other way too but currently I dont recomend this.

I'm hopeful this game will become worthing of being called ""Terraria in space"". At the moment it's closer to being Terraria's younger sibling. A bit more clumsy and less eloquent, but full of potential because of its youth.

The controls are a bit fiddly and not as fluid as in Terraria. Jumping from slopes triggers the jetpack instead of a regular jump, for example. 

The crafting interface is more organized by categorizing everything, but having to manually assign the materials from dropdown menus is clumsy at best. Worse, if you change quantity after you selected the materials, it resets the chosen materials and you have to pick them again. It'd be handy to pre-select the cheapest (or most plentiful) resources in a configuration which could build the item, by default. Changing quantity should preserve the materials already chosen. It might even change materials if that can make a recipe work when the old materials will not make it work.

The tutorial has improved. It used to be overly wordy and micro-managed you, and then it dumped you on a planet afterwards without so much of a hint as to what to do next. It's more to the point now, but after the tutorial you're still left in the middle of nowhere on a sky island without any real pointers as to what you're supposed to do.

The recent big patch added research levels which you can unlock by reading the research materials dropped by monsters you defeat. Massive improvement over the old system which basically gave you access to everything, but no clue what it did or why you would pick something. Now at least you have less choices so you can get familiar with the starter items and learn more from there.","We are still in the early access, but so far it seems like the developer is improving the game.

tl;dr Was on the way to being a good game, but ran out of fuel before it got there.

When I first played this game it had serious potential; there were unique and interesting gameplay ideas, regular updates, and most importantly devs who respond on the forum. I spent a fair amount of time playing the game, eagerly anticipating updates, until I felt I had got this jist of what the game was and where it was going, so decided to wait a couple of months before playing again. When I booted it up again half a year later the only obvious changes were some haloween gimmiks, as far as I could tell updates had ground to a standstill. A year (and a bit) later and no further changes, until I saw a post saying that the devs hadn't abandoned the game, however they could tell us why they weren't working on it at the moment (which was what promted me change my review). For comparison I've left my original review below, showing how excited I was for this game.

ORIGINAL REVIEW

This is a really promising game, with dedicated developers who are eager to share their creation with the community. 

It is not a finished game at the moment, but is what a beta game should be. Updates are designed to test specific features so that they can be polished, submitting tickets is on the main menu and the developers actually respond to posts in the forums. Although it sound like these are obvious aspects for any beta game there are too many early access games that care too much about people playing them, instead of testing them to make a better game in the long run.

The gameplay itself will be familiar to anybody who has played terraria, starbound etc, but with enough unique features to make it interesting. One of the best features is the crafting system that classifies materials (eg ice is a chemical, which is a raw material => raw/chemical/ice), therefore some recipes will require any chemical or any raw material etc.

Overall, if you are looking for a good beta that will turn into a great game, I would recommend buying it now. If you don't want to be actively involved in improving the game, then wait until it is fully released so that you aren't disappointed and forget about it.","EDIT

It is not a finished game at the moment, but is what a beta game should be. Updates are designed to test specific features so that they can be polished, submitting tickets is on the main menu and the developers actually respond to posts in the forums. Although it sound like these are obvious aspects for any beta game there are too many early access games that care too much about people playing them, instead of testing them to make a better game in the long run.

The gameplay itself will be familiar to anybody who has played terraria, starbound etc, but with enough unique features to make it interesting. One of the best features is the crafting system that classifies materials (eg ice is a chemical, which is a raw material => raw/chemical/ice), therefore some recipes will require any chemical or any raw material etc.

Overall, if you are looking for a good beta that will turn into a great game, I would recommend buying it now. If you don't want to be actively involved in improving the game, then wait until it is fully released so that you aren't disappointed and forget about it."

You have the right to record EdgeOfSpace I believe. Has Mutiplayer. Tutorial on basics at the beginning. Achievements(Not a good thing to the game, just something I like about games).

Cons - Needs bug fixes, and more ores to find early on. Crabs are too OP at the beginning. Run out of energy too fast. YOu dont regain Energy as fast as you loose it. Everything wants to kill you. No tutorial on how to make Energy work with the doors or CommandCenter(which i believe will be added?). No trading Cards(Not a downside, just something most steam games have, which I believe this game will have shortly later).

Personal Review - Ive only had this game for 1-2 days, but I can tell you, this game is a great game and has a lot of potential for a early access game. Look forward to the updates and how it will improve to be a better game than what it is now. I strongly recomend this game if you are looking for a game like Terraria and/or Starbound to play with your friends. The energy/electricty system is a little hard to understand first, but I hope it will get better with the updates. With mutiplayer you can get things done a whole lot faster, as ive played with my three other friends. If you want a survival game I recomend this game. The music is great, and has a spaceish feel to it. Mutiplayer is easy to use, just open your ports, and get the IP, boom youre in. Playabe, and has hours of game play just to get the basic things. 

I Love this game so far, and I am looking forward to the updates to make this game even better! I am planning to make a gameplay series of this game, show the updates, and how to do things in the game. 
Keep up the good work Devs!","Pros - Good game so far. Playable. Hours of game play. Survival. Dont have to remember Crafting. Music. Can make anything with anything.

Zacznijmy od tego: Nie kupujcie tej gry. Za kilka miesięcy potanią jej cenę brutto, a potem będą pewnie dawać zniżki.

Gra wita nas brzydkim Menu, chociaż jest lepiej niż przy rozpoczęciu testów Beta. Po kliknięciu Single Player przechodzimy do kreowania naszej postaci. Jest wykonane w taki sposób, że tworzymy go z kilku fryzur, kilku kolorów fryzur, kilku wyrazów twarzy i tyle. Nie wpływamy na zmianę koloru ""ubioru"", ale mamy jeszcze znaki szczególne w postaci np. chust. Dupy nie urywa. 
Przejdźmy do Tutoriala! Brzydko wykonanego, gówniane wyjaśniającego, niejasnego Tutoriala! Wyjaśnia ogólnie sterowanie, tworzenie itemów, walkę i tyle. Za przejście go całego dostajemy 4 achievementy... Jest jeszcze jeden z wszystkich pięcu, za połączenie się MP. MP na dzień dzisiejszy praktycznie nie działa, można kupić płatny serwer, ale do takiej gry...
Grafika może się spodobać, ale mnie się nie podoba. Wykonanie rzeczy jest brzydkie. Oświetlenie jest strasznie dziwne. Pochodnie świecą w kwadracie i wykonanie ""słabiącej siły światła"" pozostawia wiele do życzenia. Animacje mi się nawet podobają. Dźwięki i muzyka nie pasują do klimatu.

Ogólne minusy: Strasznie mi się nie podoba tworzenie itemków. Np. pochodnie można zrobić z ziemi, błota, albo z innego gówna... Budowanie jest na niskim poziomie. Nadal nie wiem jak się niszczy np. workbench. A w tutorialu tego nie ma...
Nie ma regeneracji HP, a w Recipe'sach nie ma żadnego, łatwego, taniego przepisu na bandarz.
Największym minusem jest cena. Wg mnie udział w beta testach powinien być darmowy, a potem usunięty, kiedy wyjdzie pełna wersja i wtedy, kiedy gracz chcę dalej grać możę się w nią wyposażyć. Jednak zapłaciłem aż 15 euro (kupiłem kilka miesięcy temu), które nigdy nie wrócą. Żałuję...

Zauwarzyłem również taką zależność. Pamiętam jak za młodu oglądałem kreskówki, które były pomysłowe, oryginalne i chciało się je oglądać. A teraz jak patrzę na dzisiejsze kreskówki... Wszystkie albo promują zabawki na licencji, albo są na podstawie słabego komiksu, a nawet które są oryginalne, nie promują niczego, ale są nudne monotonne i są chyba puszczane po to, żeby przełączyć. Przykłady takiej kreskówki to Bakugan.
Tak samo widzę gry pokroju Sandbox RPG Adventure 2D. Najpierw debiut Terrari, potem rozpoczęcie developingu Starbound'a, a teraz to... 

Na dzień dzisiejszy nie polecam, przepraszam za błędy. To była moja amatorska OPINIA. Szkolna ocena: 2- ze względu, że to beta.","-= Opinion =-
Let's start with this: Don't buy this game. In a few months, they'll lower the gross price, and then they'll probably offer discounts.

The game greets us with an ugly menu, although it's better than when the Beta test began. After clicking Single Player, we move on to character creation. It's designed so that we create a character from a few hairstyles, several hairstyle colors, a few facial expressions, and that's it. We can't change the color of the ""clothing,"" but we do have distinctive features like scarves. It's not a joke.
Let's move on to the Tutorial! A poorly made, poorly explained, and unclear Tutorial! It explains the controls, item creation, combat, and that's it. For completing it all, you get four achievements... There's one more of the five, for connecting to MP. MP is practically non-functional at the moment; you can buy a paid server, but for a game like this...
The graphics might be appealing, but I don't like it. The execution is ugly. The lighting is terribly odd. The torches glow in a square, and the ""fading light"" effect leaves much to be desired. I actually like the animations. The sounds and music don't fit the atmosphere.

General Cons: I really dislike the item crafting. For example, torches can be made from dirt, mud, or other crap... The building process is poor. I still don't know how to destroy things like a workbench. And the tutorial doesn't cover it...
There's no HP regeneration, and the Recipes don't offer any easy, cheap bandage recipes.
The biggest downside is the price. In my opinion, participation in the beta test should be free, and then removed when the full version comes out, so that players can equip it when they want to continue playing. However, I paid a whopping 15 euros (bought a few months ago), which I'll never get back. I regret it...

I also noticed this connection. I remember watching cartoons as a kid, which were creative, original, and fun to watch. And now, when I look at today's cartoons... They all either promote licensed toys or are based on a weak comic book, and even the original ones don't promote anything, but are boring, monotonous, and probably just for the sake of switching. Bakugan is an example of such a cartoon.
I see games like Sandbox RPG Adventure 2D the same way. First, the debut of Terraria, then the development of Starbound began, and now this...

As of now, I don't recommend it, sorry for any mistakes. This was my amateur OPINION. School-level rating: 2 - because it's a beta."

und siehe da, 80% meiner nörgelein haben anklang gefunden und wurden verbessert... ich hab mich sogar dabei erwischt spass beim spielen zu entwickeln...

Der Tag/Nacht-Rythmus ist nun endlich gleitend und nicht mehr BÄM! -> Tag -> BÄM! -> Nacht...

Die Krabben und Quallen versuchen jetzt auch nicht mehr einem grundloß das Hirn auszusaugen es sei denn man greift sie an

Die Monster schnabbulieren auch nicht mehr die Projektiele der Arklight weck als wär es Schokoladen-Cräck

Durch die keymapping funktion kann man sich auch endlich die tastenbelegung so hinbasteln damit das game spielbar wird

jut... wasser hab ich immer noch nicht in flüssiger form endeckt aber das kann ich verkraften

Das Baumenu ist jetz um einiges besser gemacht und umfangreicher als zum anfang

Die laserhacke braucht jetzt nicht mehr gefühlte Jahrzente um matsch abzubauen

joa war noch was? ach ja nach ner halben stunde spielzeit entschließt sich mein rechner in den freitot zu gehen und schaltet sich aus... was mich ein wenig beunruhigt :/ ... aber das nehm ich mal als anti-dauerzocker-funktion des games hin..

FAZIT:

ich hätte es nicht gedacht aber das game entwickelt sich langsam zum würdigen nachfolger von teraria und beweist mit haufenweisen features, stundenlanges zockervergnügen
aus diesem grund wandert nach ca nen halben jahr mein daumen nun doch nach oben ... gute arbeit jungs... jetz nur nicht schwächeln und weiter so ;)

ABER:

 ich würde trotzdem empfehlen mit den kauf zu warten bis das teil aus der beta raus ist.... es schwirren noch zu viele bugs umher die einen das zocken schnell wieder vermiesen können..","Okay... I dug the game out again to see if anything has changed.
And lo and behold, 80% of my complaints have been addressed and improved... I even found myself enjoying the game...

The day/night rhythm is now finally smooth and no longer BAM! -> Day -> BAM! -> Night...

The crabs and jellyfish no longer try to suck your brains out for no reason unless you attack them.

The monsters no longer devour the Arklight's projectiles like they're chocolate crackers.

Thanks to the keymapping function, you can finally customize the key assignments so the game is playable.

Well... I still haven't discovered liquid water, but I can handle that.

The construction menu is now much better and more comprehensive than it was at the beginning.

The laser pick no longer takes what feels like decades to mine mud.

Yeah, was there something else? Oh yeah, after half an hour of playing, my computer decides to commit suicide and shuts down... which worries me a little :/ ... but I'll accept that as the game's anti-constant gamer feature.

CONCLUSION:

I wouldn't have thought it, but the game is slowly developing into a worthy successor to Teraria and, with tons of features, proves to be hours of gaming fun.
For this reason, after about half a year, my thumbs are now up... great work, guys... don't let up now and keep it up ;)

BUT:

I would still recommend waiting to buy it until it's out of beta... there are still too many bugs floating around that can quickly ruin your gaming experience."

To win the battle against the horrible UI, annoying crafting system, constant dying, dull surroundings, dull music, dull combat, dull mining, dull building, dull everything. And to find the ""potential"" that people seem to be talking about. But it was a failure. 

I mean, what were the devs thinking? You know, ""BETA"" stage of development starts when you have an almost ready-to-go product, so you just need to eliminate bugs and test some features. Not when you have a game that's almost unplayable, AS WELL as buggy and unstable.

Where do i start? The world is pretty tight, so you can only explore downwards, but since you have no way to tell what's below you, 90% of the time you'll end up falling from great height, crashing and dying on impact. Not to mention that you can't go too deep since the exposure and/or mobs will kill you there. In my book that's not ""exploring"", just pointless trial and error.

You can build a base, but what's the point if you can't even respawn there? And it's not like in Terraria, where you always build a base near the surface - here you won't be able to get back up there unless you die again. And if you build it deeper, then every time you die, you'll have to go and find it again in the midst of a thousand identical floating islands. Oh yeah, and who would've guessed that these super-advanced spacefaring guys won't have a device to make a MAP of the area.

So here's how your first couple of hours in EoS will look like: you'll be jumping around, searching for at least something different from the dirt\mud\clay surrounding you, trying to get deeper, but mostly falling and dying constantly. Even if you succeed, you'll see that nothing really changes down there, except for tougher and more aggressive mobs, and the exposure timer won't let you go deeper until you get better equipment. And unless you think that painfully slow mining and crafting some aluminium pants or whatever is fun, then that's it, that's your only option here - you won't have anything else to do. 

To make things worse the game gives you no clue on how things work and why would you need them. So i can build a GENERATOR and a COMMAND CENTER, cowabunga, now what? It won't even explain the basics. Like if you played Terraria, you know there's a difference between a block and a wall. But here, there are only ""walls"", by default functioning as blocks. You actually need to hit ""TAB"" button to be able to place your ""wall"" in the background where it belongs. Only you'll never guess it unless you stumble on it in some random guide, like i did.

Yeah, whoever in the devs team is responsible for the UI deserves a bullet to the face. Why can't i place items just by dragging them from my inventory? Why do i always need to bind a hotkey to do this basic thing? Why the crafting window is so bizarre and complex? Did you see how crafting looks in Terraria? Well, look again. 

Probably there is some difference in the later stages of the game, but i gave up here. It's not like ""playing a game"" to me, more like trying to fix a car without any idea of what you're supposed to do. And with the wrench constantly slipping out of your hands and falling so you need to go pick it up again and again. 
Overall, this is my most frustrating early access experience since Project Zomboid, but at least i didn't spend my money there.","I tried, i really tried to like this game.

Compro un pack con contenido especial de terraria y no recibo nada especial...

Nada mas entrar, me tengo que tragar un tutorial interminable, que no se puede quitar, ni terminar... (esto lo quitó a las 2 semanas con un update)

En fin, podría ser un gran juego, pero con un planeta igual siempre (rollo montañas aleluya de Avatar), con los graficos feos (me gustan mas los del terraria....) y la dificultad de hacer cualquier chorrada, Starbound lo deja a la altura del betún.

I bought a pack with special Terraria content and I didn't get anything special...

As soon as I started, I had to sit through an endless tutorial, which I couldn't uninstall or finish... (this was removed after 2 weeks with an update)

Left and right sides of the screen should be never ending, sort of like the bottom of the world. really hope we can get infinite world generation. it would be great.","Great game to play co-op with a few friends.

Please remember that Edge of Space is not completed, and more features will be added as the game develops. As such, in the future this article may not be a fair representation of the game.

Edge of Space, developed by Handyman Studios and published by Reverb Publishing, is a 2D dynamically generated space adventure. Much to the likes of ever popular Terraria and recent debut of Starbound, Edge of Space allows you go venture through alien planets, build a home base, fend off the local wildlife, and most importantly, survive. It may seem like these survival games are a dime-a-dozen, but the fine folks at Handyman Studios have put their own spin on the whole “survivalcraft” genre.

I am going to preface this by saying that Edge of Space is in a very early stage of development. It was recently updated and gained some traction through Steam’s Early Access, but the fact of the matter Edge of Space is a bit rough around the edges as of right now. It can be quite a turn off to play a game so early in development, especially if it gives you the wrong impressions due to bugs and other strange anomalies. I will say, though, that in the two weeks that I’ve been playing the game, there has been a staggering amount of bug fixes and patches that have really improved the experience. I wholeheartedly believe that Edge of Space will improve in this respect as the developers iron out bugs, UI issues, and add in more content.

In Edge of Space, you play as a lonely operative representing the Ark Corporation. After catching some beauty sleep in a cryo-chamber, you wake up and realize that you’re basically lost. Your only chance of survival is to depend on the amazing technologies that brought you to the, ahem, edge of space. The only problem here is that you’ll have to find the materials you will need to survive amidst a hostile and dangerous planet. Actually, planet right not even be the right word for Edge of Space. It’s more like an asteroid field where you bounce to and from different small land masses.

One facet of Edge of Space that’s particularly interesting is how the environment is constantly working to kill you. Make no doubt about it, you’ve arrived in a hell-hole that is out for your blood. There are plenty of enemies wandering around trying to eat you, but more than that, the entire gameworld wants your flesh. As you descend lower and lower in space, you’ll take exposure damage if you’re not fully equipped. This can really be a range of things, including radiation or lack of oxygen. In order to prevent this, you’ll want to fully make sure you’ll have the supplies on you to oxygenate the area, or get rid of the radiation. As an ArkCo Operative, you can also defend your new territory with a series of droids or turrets.

As of March 2014, combat in Edge of Space is completely centered around guns. There aren’t any melee weapons as of now. However, there are some interesting ideas with the guns. My favorite example is the Arklight, a gun that shoots out a sticky, glowing canister. This is extremely useful when spelunking through the various caverns you’ll find scattered throughout space, and it sure beats placing a torch down every 10 feet. In fact, torches have such a low-light radius that I tended to stick with the narrow glow of my laser pick and the Arklight.

As someone who has never played Edge of Space before, first impressions can kill the experience. I’m not going to lie, Edge of Space is pretty rough around the edges, especially in the first hour or so. Although it has improved dramatically since I’ve recieved the game, the biggest problem is still the UI. There are some peculiarities that really need adjusting to, especially if you compare them to the flexibility of similar games. One such example would be the hotbar, which is a bit complicated because it can take multiple clicks to slot in different items. The crafting menu is categorized into different sections, but you’ll have to individually click each item you want to use in a recipe. I see what it’s trying to do, and I really like the fact that in some recipes you can substitute many different items, but it’s clunky.There are other little things like this that really drag down the experience despite the survival aspects of the game working as intended.

Edge of Space has a nonlinear sense of progression, but sometimes it is more complicated than it’s own good. There are plenty of machines that you can use to craft items, but when it comes to weapons and armor, you’ll have to go to an armory. This is really more tedious than it needs to be because you’ll have to drop down various unmarked chutes, and you’ll be given whatever weapon lies at the bottom as well as the recipe for said weapon. The first time I went into the armory, I fell down the chute and got a shotgun. Don’t get me wrong, shotguns are awesome, but I didn’t get to look at the other weapons I could have made.

In one of the recent patches, one of the developers of Terraria actually added a few things into Edge of Space. It’s great to see that Edge of Space has the support of a well-known and beloved developer, and it’s even better to see Skeletron inside of Edge of Space. Omegatron, as it’s called in-game, adds some much needed flavor to the typical crabs and floating snails you’ll find outside your base, not to mention he’s very difficult.

In the end, Edge of Space is still very much a work in progress. If you go in expecting a full-fledged game with lots of content and polish, you’ll be sorely disappointed. What Edge of Space excels at is creating a unique environment with interesting gunplay and addictive gameplay. It’s tough to quit playing when you’re in the middle of setting up a fortress, or going on an expedition to dangerous zones. Given a few extra months in the oven and I have no doubt that Edge of Space will easily turn into something that will be worth your money.","UPDATED 10/5/2016

Easily the most dull game of the year.

I've been playing Edge of Space the past eight hours; with the single thought in my mind of: ""This game must get better eventually, right?""  well; I've been essentially in the same spot with the same equipment for the past five hours.  Killing crabs n' jelly fish, and mining titanium, aluminum, stone, mud, clay, and dirt does get old after a while.  I found a strange white box with a blue arrow on it in a cave and tried to us eit, but that just flashed some screen for half a second and went away; and I was unable to interact with it again.  But let's put things into points for the sake of organization:

Good things:
*Good movement system.
*Good art & music.
*Online co-op.
*Interesting concept.

Bad Things:
*Very unpolished.
*Bad interface & not very user-friendly.
*No explanation for the purpose of alot of things, for example the matter recombiner; the game does not tell you what it does, and the description is simply: ""You can't even wager a guess as to how this crazy machine works."", normally checking a wiki would help an issue like this, but their wiki is ancient and not updated.  And then there are things like the random events that go on in the world like the crab nests, and random things such as the weird white box with blue arrow-  no idea what purpose the box served, didn't realize the crab nest was an event.
*Lack of things to do; the only goal you might have in the game is simply go lower.. And there is no reason to go lower as you have all the resources you need in the top areas.
*Lack of resources; it may seem like a good thing that alluminum is basically the most awesome freakin' resource in existence, but it really makes the game boring when you're not bothering to actually look for things.
*Uninteresting enemies.
*Uninteresting areas; why would the devs think it was a good idea to make the entire game take place on some floating rocks ?
*The relaxing music and police sirens(?) doesn't lower the boring factor of this game.
*Terrible enemy AI.
*Poorly made tutorial levels, tutorial more interesting than the actual game.
*Extremely useless chests; for this let me explain how chests work, you craft one then place it in the world; then you right click it to open it, you then have to manually drag and drop each item you wish to place in it, into it; and the chest only has three slots.
*Lack of creativity; how many times has the space shark and space animals concept been done now?
*Very unprofessional dev team.
*Just a shoddy game in general; people like to consider it as a terraria and starbound ripoff- but in all honesty that's an insult to both Terraria and Starbound.
*I'm fairly certain the preview images which show awesome things happening are all fake.
*Dropped items from full inventory disappear within seconds, made 7 chests to put my items somewhere- didn't realize my inventory was full,  chests vanish.  Make a full suit of aluminum armor, don't realize inventory is full,  poof.
*Glitchy items:  Made two chests, had two slots free- placed a chest, the other chest vanished into nowhere.  Used an emergency recall, had two in my inventory; the other vanished.

 If I had any suggestions for this game; I recommend they take a page from Windforge and add player made spaceships to fly around the edge of space.  

ps:  Don't use the Omega research unless you have good equipment, it just brings you to a boss whom will murder you if you still are using low level stuff.



Well,  all in all I recommend the game; but make sure you don't play it at night or else you're liable to fall asleep from the sheer boredom it causes; and if you're planning on buying the game because of the awesome screenshots you saw of like a desert and mechs and whatnot- those are definitely faked, there are four biomes; you can go to about two of them, a grassy biome and a cold biome.  There's also about 8 or so enemies currently and about six(?) different resources.



Edit August 2016:

So, it is now the distant future since I last reviewed the game; and honestly it's worse than before.  The game opens to a beautiful 404 page error after the Unity Logo and Splash screen.  And the game starts with you in the middle of nowhere with a shark with lasers and crap attached to it with a high pitch voice that asks you to do pointless tasks such as gathering dirt and clay for it.   Simple actions in the inventory system such as dragging an item to the trash drops the FPS immensely, nests are incredibly annoying to destroy as they infinitely respawn the enemy guards every time you shoot it; and you need to shoot one quite a lot to destroy it. 

AI is terrible, they wander back and forth not really trying to get to you, in part because their AI is considering the bullets you shoot as ground, so if they're jumping into the air and you shoot them, they will continue to jump as high as they want, or they'll just plain turn around when shot at with a little ? symbol.    The animations and art is weird, the physics is bad, the overall game is mayhaps more boring than it used to be.

But all in all, better than No Man's Sky.  So at least there is that.","Old Review:

Onto the real review. Okay basically your use to terraria, starbound, or minecraft. You assume you have the basics of building, thats check.

Now you assume you have the basics of base building, that is... barely check. You have a command center, but your given no real idea how it works, or how to use it. 0 Explanation behind it. (HINT) it supplies 2 available slots for structures that require power (Which AGAIN are not defined, nor explained) how to mine or make adjacent to a powered block (and to do that you need to mine the back, currently the mining in the background has been switched to TAB key).

Anyway... now assume after base building is scrapped, most of what you seen in the pictures, or the trailer video is either not implemented yet or considered non user useable. Thats... thats just false advertising. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME based on the trailier. You will be SEVERELY disappointed if you do!

Anyway, other than this review just remember... with a grain of salt.  Comparing this game to minecraft is laughable at best, as minecraft is one of the most fleshed out, well prepared games out their for survival. Just its block based graphics.

With Starbound you get the perks of it having terraria gameplay with a twist, mechs, turrets, space ship home & planetary home combine with world travelining leading to finte adventures.

With Terraria you get alota building functionality but... only one world, on the upside in Terraria you also get to transfer items on your character with you to other servers.

With this game Edge of Space you... get working building mechanics (barely anything to craft though), good music (when its not tearing horribly or desyncing), horribly slow mining, extremely aggressive enemy npcs that fight you based on how far down you go, and how pre-occupied you are not paying attention to your surroundings, and limited idea of how to really play altogether with out continued communication through the steam forums with other players, and the developer(s)/staff of Edge of Space.

If you want this game buy it, i bought 2 copies, but now im beginning to regret my investment considering how much is lacking, how much is currently missing, and what is functional, works, and what isnt combine with all the time lost to just... well... mining, searching, and trying to figure out this game altogether with searching the steam forums, and trial and error in the game itself.

Now that you've got a conclusion, let's cover the reasoning.  This game is, at best, a pre-beta.  It's not stable enough to be a beta, the mechanics are either half broken or entirely unbalanced, and the game lacks enough content to be playable.

This game is unstable, and runs poorly even on a beast of a machine (3930k and 7970 GPU).  I've had numerous crashes, and the game occasionally just hangs for a minute.  During that time I've been destroyed by numerous enemies, lost progress, and lost items. 

The crafting system is entirely broken.  Enemies level up several orders of magnitude faster than your equipment can.  There's no invincibility mechanics, so a swarm of enemies can strip even a well equipped character in seconds.  You bounce when an enemy hits under you, so you can be air juggled to death.  Numbers mean nothing.  You start with a paltry heath and shield, but coming back with 10 times bettter stats doesn't make you live longer, because the game occasionally just spawns a dozen enemies around you.  All of this is predicated upon oyu exploring, but that's realy a joke because any upgrade past to most basic will require hours of random tunneling to get anything.  The real kicker is the crap weapons.  You have to craft ammo, but even worse the weapons requiring ammo aren't great.

Content has recently been dramatically expanded.  The waiting for resources to process has been removed, and there's more to make.  Unfortunately again, this is useless.  You spend huge amounts of time now searching for resources, to synthesize into other resources, to synthesize into useable goods.  After all of that grind, you're left with gear which still allows the enemies to absolutely curb stomp you constantly.  If the point of this game is crafting, then they really need to go back and rebalance enemy strength, progression rates, and the insane cost of items.  There's no reason that you shouldn't have all research completed prior to finishing the second area, and even if you do some of the end game items require an amount of resources which literally exceeds those present on a single biome.  

In a single sentence: this game is fundamentally broken and the rate of progression indicates that we'll see completed project in a few years at best.




Negative comments generally warrant some thought.  In the case of a review, you should provide the people who made the prokect a way to fix it.  Let's start there.
1) Stop trying to be Terraria.  You've got guns with and without ammo, crafting, and resource gathering.  That doesn't mean you are as good as Terraria, and you shouldn't invite the comparison.
2) Ditch your current crafting system.  It requires too many diverse resources, it's convoluted, and there's no 1:1 comparison for item utility.  Combining that with the random nature of weapons means I can get a weapon worse than my current one, while spending much rarer resources.  That's frustrating, but what's even worse is having dozens of different armors that show no clear progression.  You've got a needlessly complex system, too many resources, and none of it is balanced.  Stop adding more, and just get the bare bones in place.
3) Rebalance enemies.  They're cheap, their spawns are a giant middle finger to the player, and more often than not they have too much health.  Spending 45 minutes fending off the Head Hunter boss isn't a challenge, it's a gruelling grind.  This particular point is arguably compounded by the crap weapons choice.
4) Develop the game.  I'm going to be blunt here, you aren't putting any appreciable effort in here.  It may actually be huge from your side, but I can't see it as the consumer.  In almost a year I'm still dealing with poor balance, no content, and unfulfilled promises.  Either discontinue the game, or finish it.  Right now this is looking to be an alpha we have to bay for, that will never be up to beta standards.  I can tell you that I'll never be giving another cent to anyone involved with this project unless they've got a completed game.  This extended beta is absolutely worthless, because its triumphs are drowned in a sea of failure and unfinished code.

After 3 separate returns to this game, I'm done.  You don't deserve anyone's patronage, unless you can tell us when we're going to get something worth the money.  This garbage surely isn't.","Do not purchase this game.

Pro's 

Cheap price, and as of this review you get a bonus copy for a family or friend.
Nice backgrounds for biomes.

Sounds: Not Starbound and not as enjoyable as Terraria, but it fits the sci fi theme.

Jetpacks: Jetpacks!


Cons

Tutorial, Doors fail to open, chest have the wrong things in it. Command help comes a little too late.

Items that don't work, example starting gun you make does 1 damage a hit but enemies take 0 damage. You die before you can kill the weakest of things

Usual glitches that I will not list because this is an early access.


So in final I would tell anyone to give it a try while its cheap and you get the bonus copy, after that go watch some let's play of it or perhaps some one streaming on Twitch.

 Einfach nur verbugt und langweilig . Z.B. wenn man das Toutorial abgeschlossen hat und einmal im Multiplayer war , hat man schon 80% der Errungenschaften . Oder das man kisten mit f ""aktiviert"" , sich ein Kisten-Screen öffnet und der dann bleibt , egal wie weit man von der Kiste weg ist . Die Grafik finde ich auch scheiße , da sieht Terraria echt 10 Mal besser aus , oder Starbound . Von Letzteren ist es auch einfach nur abgeguckt . Dazu kommen noch die Logikfehler , wie das mit den soeben erwänten Kisten-Screens und dass man die Rückwand seinen Raumschiffs , oder was auch immer das ist , abbauen kann .
Die Ladescreens sind auch unnötig lange . 

Ich habe zwar erst ne halbe Stunde gespielt , aber diese hat spaß gemacht , denn ich habe mich mit meinem Kumpel über dieses Spiel ne Runde lustig gemacht .

Ich hoffe ja , dass da noch ein paar fette Updates kommen und das schnell !!!

Wenn ihr euch dieses Stück unfertigen Dreck holen wollt , dann fragt einen Freund und kauft die Edition (oder wie auch immer das hier heißt) bei der 2 dabei sind (eins für euch und eins zum verschenken) , kostet auch so 12€

Good:
1. It has the terraria feeling about it.
2. Lots of different stats which you can tweak via equipment
3. Dungeons are much more interresting and larger than those of Starbound. They are almost equal good as those of Terraria.
4. I like the guns. Weapons are much cooler than the ugly ones of Starbound.

Needs improvement:
1. It's really user unfriendly interface. Example: Sometimes you need to press 'v' and sometimes 'f' to use stations. It wouldn't hurt if it was just one button for all stations.
2. Tutorial is horrible. It tells you to do different things and you have no clue what you need to do. Tutorial is try and error approach. It wouldn't hurt if they also showed more clearly where you need to go to craft things.
3. The spawn rate are quite frustrating sometimes.
4. It's to linear approach regarding what you can craft. So it wouldn't hurt if they changed the research. Skip it all together and just let us collect resources. If we collect a resource then all equipment you can craft with that resource shows up and you can see what's missing.

I just got this game gifted by my wife. We both like Minecraft and love Starbound (Sorry EoS, you have to take this comparison).

I´m no friend of harsh words, but this game can be summarized in one word: crap.

The controls are horrible. Its far from intuitive, after learning what to press you just hate the many buttons you have to press.
It actually feels like it came out 1991 for DOS and also looks like it.
The retro-style is one thing, but this game looks really terrible. I was inspired by the trailer, but the actual game looks nothing like it. The animation is clumsy, the backgrounds look like plain wallpapers. Stuff like your mining-laser... the length always stays the same, the grafic ignores the distance you point with the cursor - kinda confusing.

If the developers work hard on the controls and the designers put more work into the grafics and animations - it could get better. But just now I can`t recommend this game.

Its not like this is a Game Lauch sale...or a 8 months from Retail Release sale; its still in Early Access...like it has been for the last 8 months....at the same exact price it was back in June/July.

Overall as of right now i would barely give it a 2/10 very disappointed if this doesn't get fixed i would label it as a waste of money."

Из плюсов я отметил:
- Атмосферную музыку
- Отличную идею для игры
- Неплохой геймплей
- Очень интересная система электричества
Игра конечно похожа на Starbound, я бы сказал довольно сильно (возможно разработчики повзаимствовали некоторые идеи от туда), но уже можно заметить что эта игра более симуляторная по множеству аспектов в меню персонажа.
Поскольку игра сырая минусов очень много, например:
 -Каждую 1-2 секунды просядает FPS с прерыванием звука (Железо Nvidia GTX660, AMD fx4170)
-Занятся толком нечем
-Быстро надоедает в счет своей сырости.

Плюсы:
Акцент на дальнобойном оружии.
Достаточно простой крафт.
Судя по описанию и прочей хрени, огромное пространство для апгрейда и изучения крафта.
UPD(24.03.14): Очень крутая система тикетов, отзывчивые разрабы. Сообщил о 2х багах и 1 раз просто не знал что делать, ответили, сделал. Молодцы. 

Минусы:
Обучение хорошее, только вот без языка очень трудно обходиться.
Ночь наступает слишком резко.
Какие-то лаги, где-то раз в секунду происходит мини-лаг, дернется картинка и щелчок в звуке.

Нашёл такой баг (в обучении), что чар запоролся, а на него я грохнул не 1 час.
На 3-ем этапе обучения дают какую-то хрень (похожую на плавник), которая ставится в слот рядом с джетпаком. Я поставил её рядом с ним, в ""показушный"" слот, потом подумал, вдруг она имеет какие-либо бонусы и решил снять джетпак. После нажатия по джетпаку, в руки взялась та хрень заместо джетпака, положил в сумку, попытался ещё раз, щёлкнул опять уже в пустую ячейку джетпака, и (!!!) опять поднял эту хрень, таким образом скопил 3шт в сумке. Решил перезайти, мол вдруг лишнее удалится, а джетпак вернется. После этого, за перса больше не зашло. Бесконечная загрузка.




UPD 30.12.2014: Войдя в игру сразу пару минусов бросилось в глаза. Но конечно и положительные стороны были замечены.

Минусы: 
----- Пропала система тикетов.
- В течении 10 минут наткнулся на критичный баг, который не удалось (к счастью) воспроизвести. (после попытки использования ресерч объектов, не закрывалось окно с вопросом ""использовать все?"", таким образом закрыл на альт+ф4)
--- Ночь и день по-моему равны по времени.
--- Инвентарь вроде как заметно уменьшился.

Плюсы:
+++++ Игра только при создании мира думает долго, потом же пара секунд, что на несколько порядков быстрее чем ранние версии.
++ Новые мобы, в некоторых случаях менее агрессивные. 
+++ ""Новые"" стволы.
+++ Упразднение некоторых видов боеприпасов.
+ ""Нормальное"" обучение.
+++ Нормальная ""стоимость"" главного оборудования (телепорт к примеру). Теперь хоть на каждом углу ставь.

Спорные моменты:
~ Новая система крафта и ресерч.
~ По сути, ресерч эт канеш круто. Но требуется экспа и ресурсы. Не логично на коленке проводить научные исследования, собирая ком из грязи.
~ Так же теперь если не знать азы, можно дооооолго думать где же найти нужный нам верстак.

The majority of exploration and progress is top-bottom, as is fairly common for sandbox exploration/building games, but where other games take place at a single land mass, EoS’ world is composed of numerous floating islands, some tiny, some very large. If you don’t feel like digging down, walking to an island’s edge and jumping to the one bellow is always an option. (And having a jetpack from the start helps you not to fall to death this way. Usually.) 

When it comes to combat, Edge of Space gives highest “Player vs Environment” feeling than other games of its genre. Instead of challenging powerful bosses like in Terraria, EoS’ focus in on fighting ever present and deadly “common” enemies, who present constant and serious threat.

However, ever-present enemy threat has side effect of limiting player’s ability to build in lower areas of the world. Aside from danger to player, many mid-late game enemies has structure-damaging attacks, and will easily wreck both your base and landscape you were trying to preserve.

Also on the negative side, Edge of Space is rather lacking in variety: there are only 3 main biomes in the game, and they don’t feel as unique as Terraria or Starbound’s biomes. Visually the game isn’t very pleasing to an eye either, and everything is mostly brown or metallic-gray (possibly done on purpose for “realism” – we all know that Real Is Brown).

Overall, Edge of Space is quite good, and I can fully recommend it to fans of sandbox exploration/building, who already had their fill with Terraria and Starbound. And those who are more interesting in action than building will probably find that aspect of EoS even more appealing than that of other games of its genre.","I played Edge of Space since the early days of its EA release, and while I enjoyed it a lot, I have to admit it doesn’t quite measure up to two more prominent games of its genre: Terraria and Starbound.

Before writing this, I was reading other reviews, and I completely disagree with one of them, which said something about the game being a little hard or it being objectiveless, and even it being difficult to progress, and even when you did, you would not feel like there was even any progression at all(Review posted June 11). All of it is sorta BS because how is it hard if you literally have 3-4 minutes of night, when things start spawning?(In the caves) How can you feel objectiveless if you have a kick-ass NPC right from the beginning, asking you to help it, and even making cute little sounds when you agree to help it or not be mean to it? How can there not be any progression at all if when you even mine a single block, you get 5 exp, but it then adds up? There really can't be any objective if you set one yourself, or you ask the NPC right from the beginning, yet, I believe i remember the game even saying that you can talk to said NPC.

Anyways, although I did end up finding fun in the game again, like riding snails, or making pits of hell for passive crabs to jump down, it did a few things that irked me, even though it's in early access. Well, for one, the tutorial. When you spawn in, you get pretty nice videos, dont get me wrong, they were nice, but they took up the entire right bottom corner of your screen. I don't want to go and say that they're bad, but it would probably be better if a message popped up asking if you wanted to watch the videos during the tutorial. Another thing was that when it was 12:00 at night, and you were in a cave,(Especially early game) 1: The monsters that spawn hurt. 2: Why spawn in the middle of the night, only to stay during the day?

Personally, I'm very mixed on this game. It really varies from person to person. If I were able to buy it again, but with the current amount of knowledge I have on the game, I would wait until it comes out  with reviews. But you know what? I enjoyed the 34 hours on this game. No regrets. Not that I'm not going to ever play the game again, since i did buy the special edition. However, there are a few aspects that can be so easily exploited, like if you're going to die, you can just exit the game, only to appear at your cryopod, aka spawn point. Even at the tutorial, there's mounds of resources you can get, with no threats, giving a very significant edge in the early game.

TL:DR; The game is amazing, even though there are a few parts to it that can be questionable, but the exception is that it's early access, and it is already a game that has so much potential of being an even better game. Best to wait until it is released out of early access, but it can be even better if you choose to buy it during early access.

The Dev support for this game has been stellar, with all my submitted bug reports and support tickets being responded to within a day at most, and the bugs themselves fixed within a few days. As of the Thanksgiving Patch, I have had no crashes or freezes, but there is also an in-game save option for those of us who get paranoid about beta crashes.

There's a lot of systems testing and bug-hunting going on at the present stage of development, but there is enough content to really have a blast.

The mobs at present are not pushovers, and can really tear you apart if you aren't careful. Personally, I like that the mob danger factor is so high, as it adds a real tension to the exploration aspect of the game. There is a mechanism in place for craftable respawns, which takes out some of the sting from dying. 

I've gone on some intense-to-the-point-of-adrenaline-rush missions descending down through the biomes to find and unlock tech upgrades, while mobs and missiles chased my tail. I love the descent into danger mechanism of this game, where there is always an element of risk involved, and skill with manoeuvring and shooting is rewarded.

The gameplay is a combination of resource gathering, mob killing, building, crafting, and exploration. 
There are quest/mission equivalents, in the form of finding Tech Waypoints, where the reward for success is unlocking boosted statistics and/or new craftables, such as better weapons and armour. 

There are also wormhole events - at present these are time-constrained events where you have a specific timeframe to explore and loot what you can before your time runs out and the wormhole collapses. (Word from the Devs is that there will be a number of different kinds of wormhole events, including boss battles, which I am looking forward to)

At present time, there are only two complete Biomes in the Beta, and a limited number of tech upgrades and crafting options. That being said, I haven't exhausted that limited content in the 30 hours I've played thus far, which isn't bad at all for a beta. Furthermore, from the official forums and chats with the devs, it looks like what is presently in game is but a small fraction of the content planned for launch and post-launch.

I've found myself losing hours to this game, and do not regret spending money on it at all. As of 30/11, Multiplayer is still disabled, but word from the Devs indicates that this is only temporary while they finetune the coding. So at present, and likely for a few more weeks to come given the time of year, the game does only have single player mode. 

That hasn't stopped me from having a damn good time with the game though. I definitely recommend it if Terraria or Metroidvania-styled gameplay tickles your fancy.","This is probably the most enjoyable Early Access Beta I've participated in.

The mobs at present are not pushovers, and can really tear you apart if you aren't careful. Personally, I like that the mob danger factor is so high, as it adds a real tension to the exploration aspect of the game. There is a mechanism in place for craftable respawns, which takes out some of the sting from dying. 

I've gone on some intense-to-the-point-of-adrenaline-rush missions descending down through the biomes to find and unlock tech upgrades, while mobs and missiles chased my tail. I love the descent into danger mechanism of this game, where there is always an element of risk involved, and skill with manoeuvring and shooting is rewarded.

The gameplay is a combination of resource gathering, mob killing, building, crafting, and exploration. 
There are quest/mission equivalents, in the form of finding Tech Waypoints, where the reward for success is unlocking boosted statistics and/or new craftables, such as better weapons and armour. 

There are also wormhole events - at present these are time-constrained events where you have a specific timeframe to explore and loot what you can before your time runs out and the wormhole collapses. (Word from the Devs is that there will be a number of different kinds of wormhole events, including boss battles, which I am looking forward to)

At present time, there are only two complete Biomes in the Beta, and a limited number of tech upgrades and crafting options. That being said, I haven't exhausted that limited content in the 30 hours I've played thus far, which isn't bad at all for a beta. Furthermore, from the official forums and chats with the devs, it looks like what is presently in game is but a small fraction of the content planned for launch and post-launch.

I've found myself losing hours to this game, and do not regret spending money on it at all. As of 30/11, Multiplayer is still disabled, but word from the Devs indicates that this is only temporary while they finetune the coding. So at present, and likely for a few more weeks to come given the time of year, the game does only have single player mode. 

That hasn't stopped me from having a damn good time with the game though. I definitely recommend it if Terraria or Metroidvania-styled gameplay tickles your fancy."

-=== EDGE OF SPACE ===-

RECOMMENDED : Highly NOT (You shall not pass, run you fools)
Go to buy STARBOUND or TERRARIA



Reasons :

- Handyman Studios is one worst team on Steam. Look at Steam Community score : only 57% approved this game, that mean +3% during last year. All score <75% always mean problems with devs or game is simply bad.

- Don't waste time & money with pure rip off from original without bringing anything fun : Starbound & Terraria are both better experience.

- devs don't solve players problems and ignore them. After many monthes i reported problems they ignored me greatly because they said on forum : ""we are small team we need time to investigate all problems"". There is difference between ""needing time"" and never answer. They wasted time to offer Santa event outside beta and not to fix all problems on basic beta build. They call that ""beta"". One worst support team ever on Steam. I don't believe they act like ignoring person. They banned me to forum to be sure i'll never ask more about my crashes problem.

- full censorship on forum : you write they don't solve your problem, you aren't agree with devs, you said to them truth, they simply call admin to get your permanently ban. Its 1st time on Steam i got banned. They closed my mouth like that and continue to lie to sell more copies !!!

- gameplay : Edge of Space is bad gameplay. When you rip-off game, you have all time to improve  features from original. EoS gameplay is worst than Starbound or Terraria. This game require more tools bar, full control mouse UI. I don't know who designed UI but iam sure its not gamer, its simply someone who don't understand how computer UI should be. They lack of experience lead to boring UI which result in waste of time selecting and ordering what you want & need

- lacks of good balanced weapons ruin game : all i know is i won't made war with Handyman Studios. They understand nothing about war. They are so unexperienced you'll get death in-game. When you see all weapons which exist in real life, and play Edge of Space (game in future), you'll be convinced by this voluntary act of ruining game to create fake difficulty. 

- annoying crafting system : you need to allocate all materials each time (should be auto select by default with lowest materials matching). Tons of time wasted to craft something you need fast. Why to inflict that pain to players ?

- multiplayer : you join server writing direct IP. Never use your real IP because it's never safe & some hackers will be happy to use exploit from beta to hack your computer. I got lot of problems during beta multi. You'll play at your own risks. Because they banned me to not solve my crashes problem, i can't say its because i was hacked during play or its only because beta.

- Handyman Studios is small team : even if game is in beta, you won't get any answer from support if you are alone/few to experience it because ""small team"" mean not enough time to solve it. In real, they are able to get your money but not to correct all problems. They are able to build exotic patch like Santa but not to help each players to fix problems. They do exactly what they want. For me its last time i gave money for early access game.

- changing screen settings need to restart game

- tutorial : incomplete & bugged tutorial



- - - To end - - -

Save your money & time buying Starbound or Terraria instead of Edge of Space.
Don't feed Trolls
 - who try to seduce you with new games based on stupid ripp-off without bringing something better
 - who lie everyday on forum practicing censorship & permanently ban
 - who offer 0 support about crashes.

It's last time i give my money to indies during early access. Handyman Studios are blacklisted forever. 

Its time to start my Edge of Boycott : YOU SHALL NOT PASS !!!

- annoying crafting system : you need to allocate all materials each time (should be auto select by default with lowest materials matching). Tons of time wasted to craft something you need fast. Why to inflict that pain to players ?

- multiplayer : you join server writing direct IP. Never use your real IP because it's never safe & some hackers will be happy to use exploit from beta to hack your computer. I got lot of problems during beta multi. You'll play at your own risks. Because they banned me to not solve my crashes problem, i can't say its because i was hacked during play or its only because beta.

- Handyman Studios is small team : even if game is in beta, you won't get any answer from support if you are alone/few to experience it because ""small team"" mean not enough time to solve it. In real, they are able to get your money but not to correct all problems. They are able to build exotic patch like Santa but not to help each players to fix problems. They do exactly what they want. For me its last time i gave money for early access game.

- changing screen settings need to restart game

- tutorial : incomplete & bugged tutorial



- - - To end - - -

Save your money & time buying Starbound or Terraria instead of Edge of Space.
Don't feed Trolls
 - who try to seduce you with new games based on stupid ripp-off without bringing something better
 - who lie everyday on forum practicing censorship & permanently ban
 - who offer 0 support about crashes.

It's last time i give my money to indies during early access. Handyman Studios are blacklisted forever. 

Its time to start my Edge of Boycott : YOU SHALL NOT PASS !!!

Thx to read my evaluation."
