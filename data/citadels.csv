Вы сами играли в это недоразумение?
Я вот поиграл 2 часа, еле-как отстроил
жалкое подобие крепости, с внутренней
рабочей экономикой, всё было терпимо.

Но в один прекрасный момент:

- Крестьяне начали вечно застревать
в постройках, их нельзя казнить или 
прогнать, они будут навеки обречены
сидеть в текстурах.

- Если застревающие крестьяне,
просто мешали балансу игры, то вот
баг с невозможностью сохранить игру,
это уже полностью отбитое желание
вернуться в неё.

Я считаю, что не стоит даже пробовать
в неё поиграть, так как это залёт на

просто расстроиться, удалить и забыть.","Developers, I'd punch you in the face!
Have you played this nonsense yourself?
I played for two hours, barely managed to build a
pathetic semblance of a fortress, with an internal
working economy, and everything was tolerable.

But then one fine day:

- Peasants started getting stuck forever
in buildings; they can't be executed or driven away; they'll be forever doomed
to sit in the textures.

- If stuck peasants
were simply interfering with the game's balance, then the
bug with the inability to save the game
has completely ruined any desire to
return to it.

I don't think it's even worth trying
to play it, as it's a one-session game, just to look at it,
to get frustrated, delete it, and forget about it."
130253097,russian,2023.00.06 12:27,❌,❌,0.5634613633,6,"Редко захожу писать отрицательные отзывы, но тут тот самый случай. Игра продается как Stronghold, но больше напоминает нелюбимых многими Settlers 5, даже карты и дизайн строений схожи, разве что сюжета почти не завезли и героев нет (или я до них не дошел). 

Мрачный средневековый антураж и вся экономика направленная на военное дело и оборону - само по себе не плохо, но это просто не работает.

- Строительство стен настолько неприятное и неудобное, насколько вообще возможно;
- Выделение крестьян кликом происходит не там, где стоит крестьянин. Кстати свободных рабочих придется искать с  лупой, и вообще вспомнить куда вы посылали их.
- ИИ максимально не послушный и тупой. Войска бегут по одним им известным траекториям, а рабочие могут буквально ОТКАЗАТЬСЯ идти строить то, что вы скажете.
И это, буквально, только начало игры!

Спасибо, конечно, я лучше что-нибудь качественное включу. Даже Settlers 5 не вызывал столько неприятных эмоций.","I rarely write negative reviews, but this is exactly the case. The game is marketed as Stronghold, but it's more reminiscent of the much-disliked Settlers 5. Even the maps and building designs are similar, except there's almost no storyline and no heroes (or at least I never got around to them).

The dark medieval setting and the entire economy focused on military affairs and defense aren't bad in themselves, but it just doesn't work.

- Building walls is as unpleasant and inconvenient as it gets;
- Selecting peasants by clicking doesn't work where they're standing. Incidentally, you'll have to search for available workers with a magnifying glass and even remember where you sent them.
- The AI ​​is incredibly disobedient and slow. Troops run along paths known only to them, and workers can literally REFUSE to build what you tell them to.
And this is literally just the beginning of the game!

Thanks, of course, I'd rather play something better. Even Settlers 5 didn't evoke such unpleasant emotions."

Pra quem gosta de jogos de RTS não sente tanta dificuldade com a mecânica do jogo que, no pouco que joguei, achei parecido com o Stronghold da Firefly, mas é claro, com suas diferenças e singularidades. 

Porém, o maior problema do jogo é que realmente ele foi abandonado pela desenvolvedora. O jogo está cheio de bugs. E o que me levou a escrever esta analise foi que eu não consegui jogar por 10 minutos uma partida da campanha sem que o jogo fechasse sozinho. Tentei, para dar continuidade a campanha e não perder o progresso, ir salvando o jogo a cada novo detalhe que eu fazia na partida, contudo, ainda assim, o jogo continua fechando, o que torna muito difícil concluir uma simples campanha. 

Se a distribuidora cuidasse do seu jogo, e corrigisse os erros, e claro acrescentasse alguns detalhes, não tenho duvidas que seria um ótimo jogo.","The game itself is quite interesting.
For those who enjoy RTS games, the mechanics won't be too difficult. In the brief playthrough, I found it similar to Firefly's Stronghold, but with its own unique features.

However, the game's biggest problem is that it was abandoned by the developer. The game is riddled with bugs. What prompted me to write this review was that I couldn't play a campaign match for 10 minutes without the game crashing. I tried, to continue the campaign and avoid losing progress, to save the game after each new detail I made in the match. However, the game still crashed, making it very difficult to complete a simple campaign.

If the publisher would take care of its game, fix the bugs, and of course add some details, I have no doubt it would be a great game."

- Second point, is that building walls is very specific, and you will need some time to understand how it is to be placed.
- The worst part I have found in the game, is that selecting units by holding the right click is problematic.

1-El juego se cuelga cada dos por tres aun bajando la calidad de imagen al minimo; que no deberia hacerlo. Mi ordenador aguanta juegos con calidad de video bastante superior. No entiendo como da tanto problema. 
2-El control de las unidades es bastante pesimo. No hay forma de redigirlas o redireccionarlas. Las unidades no forman grupos y se mezclan. 
3-Las unidades a pie destrullen demasiado rapido las murallas. Las catapultas y demás maquinaria de asedio tiene el mismo rango de longitud que las colocadas en las defensas de las torres.
4-Las unidades se crean muy despacio. No da tiempo a reponer soldados cuando éstos mueren, aun convirtiendo a todos los aldeanos en guerreros.
5-Los aldeanos son un poco inutiles. Cuando seleccionas a varios para que construyan parte de la muralla, algunos se colocan en el lado opuesto. Si en el otro lado hay roca o un barranco se quedan atrapados. No hay forma de indicarles que construyan desde el otro lado. Lo hacen automaticamente. Esto te hace perder el tiempo levantando y destruyendo la muralla. 
6-A este juego, como a muchos, le falta un editor de mapas. Me gustaria poder crear mi mapa y colocar las montañas y los recursos donde yo quiera. Encima que tardan en crearse las unidades, ir a buscar minerales es una odisea.

En resumen, es un juego que por la calidad de video que se ve en las imagenes pintaba bastante bien.(((MENTIRA))) Podria ser un buen juego. El poder hacer tu propia ciudad fortificada, colocar los edificios donde quieras y con la orientacion que quieras... todo eso esta muy bien, pero el juego funciona muy lento, los aldeanos recogen recursos muy lentamente y crear soldados cuando te atacan tambien es lento, además de que el combate es bastante caotico. El juego da muchos problemas. 


¡NO LO COMPREIS!
","I bought it for €5 and I don't recommend the game.

1. The game crashes all the time, even when I lower the image quality to the minimum setting; which it shouldn't. My computer can handle games with much higher video quality. I don't understand why it's causing so much trouble.
2. Unit control is pretty terrible. There's no way to redirect or re-route them. Units don't form groups and just mix together.
3. Foot units destroy walls too quickly. Catapults and other siege machinery have the same length range as those placed on tower defenses.
4. Units are created very slowly. There's no time to replenish soldiers when they die, even if you convert all the villagers into warriors.
5. The villagers are a bit useless. When you select several to build part of the wall, some are placed on the opposite side. If there's a rock or a ravine on the other side, they get trapped. There's no way to tell them to build from the other side. They do it automatically. This wastes your time raising and destroying the wall.
6-This game, like many others, lacks a map editor. I'd like to be able to create my map and place the mountains and resources wherever I want. On top of that, creating units takes a long time, and mining for minerals is an odyssey.

In short, it's a game that, judging by the video quality seen in the images, looked pretty good. (((LIE))) It could be a good game. Being able to make your own fortified city, placing buildings wherever you want and in any orientation you want... that's all very well, but the game runs very slowly, villagers collect resources very slowly, and creating soldiers when attacked is also slow, and combat is quite chaotic. The game causes a lot of problems.

Mein Mitgefühl gehört den Leuten die den vollen Verkaufspreis gezahlt haben.","So, unfortunately (although ""unfortunately"" isn't appropriate here), I couldn't play the game any longer; it crashes constantly.
But even after this short time, I can't recommend buying it.
You'd think the developers had never played a game like this before; they're missing so many features that today's games simply have to have, and they can't even manage to patch them properly.
My sympathy goes out to the people who paid the full retail price."

Aside from the graphics, which I find decent for this type of game, what personally pissed me off was mostly the crashes and the AI, because sometimes everything's fine, but for example, when there aren't many trees left in a forest, you wait for them to cut everything down so you can build something in their place. You see your lumberjacks cutting wood, but not necessarily this close to the lumberjack camp, and that's really enough to get angry. They're often dissidents and sometimes even refuse to do what you ask them to do. You shouldn't be on top of it, even if it means cutting down the last tree and making sure it doesn't go elsewhere...

It would be really good if they patched the game because in its current state, I absolutely do not recommend it."

On sale for a 1.49...It's not much, still not worth it. As I say below, there is a good concept here...putting aside the ""jank"" and not being able to build walls properly for a stronghold/castle.. The real problem is, after first few battle maps you play, some don't load right and there is no way to finish them. The later you get in the game, the more common this happens, I think it was the only 5th or 6th mission the objective wasn't on the map. Probably most of my hours were on that one mission. 

The finished product feels basically like the first version of a beta that wasn't even attempted to be fixed.

The worst thing is, most people who like this genera will get the concept and enjoy it, but can't enjoy because it's impossible. That's the frustrating part. It could have been a good solid game.


GREAT CONCEPT! There is a lot of different units in just one class of solider, in most games of this nature you might just have crossbow men and archers, you have other type of bow men and other combat units that are good for ceartin type of attacks, so your not always just tossing out top tier troops

Besides that, the game falls flat and is simply broken. Yes the dreaded broken game my friends. I played and played level 3 a several times, and can't beat it because the game doesn't want me to, it's not due to lack of trying or being defeated....It just  freezes on the level after a half hour or so.

In any game, buidling your castle is one of the most fun parts, it's a freak'en nightmare. Nothing lines up, even when you think your walls are together they aren't, for some odd reason. When you finally do get your castle walls straight it seems like you only need a handful of bowmen to fend off any baddies. 

The AI took the short bus to school,  they charge your castle in small groups sort of like they are hazing you and testing you out but they end up accomplishing nothing.

It does have an interesting system  when it comes to getting resources, you just don't chop down word, you have to make them into planks with a special production house. I like the mirco mangement, and you can switch workers from job to job. I like RTS games where it takes time to raise an army and it's not just about who can build the fastest army first like starcraft. 

I would have finished the game dispite it's flaws but at the end of the day when a game is broken and can't play you can't give it a thumbs up.","Edit: Dec 2022

""Citadels"" seems to me more like a cheap initial copy of ""Empire Earth."" The graphics are more from 2000 than 2013! The game is very unstable and more like an Early Access game! The variety you're looking for here is nowhere to be found! Walls are placed in abundance, units can simply walk around the outside and get through the smallest gaps, and the space you have to build is more satisfactory than good. If the game costs its €27.99, stay away, because as it is, it's only worth €5. I got it from a bundle, but calling this a finished game is clearly a ""failure."" What does the game have to offer story-wise? Um... if you want to read, you can do so before the campaign, but it's basically the same stupid gameplay! Just build units and towers, attack the enemy town hall, and win. Is that all there is to it? The community is supposed to shell out a cool €28 for this. You haven't heard the bang in a long time!

O jogo segue os moldes de ""Age of Empire"", tendo ainda outros modos de jogo para se deleitar. Seguindo o modo Campanha, o Rei Arthur está governando. Ele é um grande e sábio governador. Seus súditos o tratam com respeito e os Cavaleiros da Távola Redonda permanecem fielmente ao seu lado. Está é Camelot! Os arqui-inimigos de Arthur reuniram forças com os Saxões e os Nórdicos para formar um imenso exército. E Arthur fará de tudo para não ver seu sonho destruído.

Gráficos, jogabilidade, dificuldade das campanhas e outros pequenos pontos..., são excelentes! Suas decisões e estratégias, podem mudar a história..., e o rumo do Jogo, traduzindo-se me grandes batalhas. É uma grande aquisição em sua bibliioteca, garantia de várias horas de entreterimento. Minha única crítica... está diante do fato, que todo o jogo está ""amarrado"" no modo Campanha... impedindo a criação de cenários aleatórios, e somente desafios de batalha.

Mas, como não podia deixar de ser... este jogo, eu também, RECOMENDO!!
","The renowned BitCompuser takes us on a journey through a fantastical past in this new version of the King Arthur saga.

The game follows the ""Age of Empire"" model, with other game modes to enjoy. In Campaign mode, King Arthur rules. He is a great and wise ruler. His subjects treat him with respect, and the Knights of the Round Table remain faithfully at his side. This is Camelot! Arthur's archenemies have joined forces with the Saxons and the Norse to form a vast army. And Arthur will do everything to prevent his dream from being destroyed.

The graphics, gameplay, campaign difficulty, and other small details are excellent! Your decisions and strategies can change history and the course of the game, resulting in great battles. It's a great addition to your library, guaranteed to provide hours of entertainment. My only criticism... is that the entire game is ""tied"" to Campaign mode... preventing the creation of random scenarios, and only battle challenges.

But, of course... I also RECOMMEND this game!!"

Another thing is the menus and extremely unfriendly interface. There are many icons which supposedly show different resources.. the only thing is they're basically all the same. Adding to the horrible interface is the crappy layout of buildings and options. There's just a bunch of fancy pop-out menus with NOTHING in them.

Another thing is the menus and extremely unfriendly interface. There are many icons which supposedly show different resources.. the only thing is they're basically all the same. Adding to the horrible interface is the crappy layout of buildings and options. There's just a bunch of fancy pop-out menus with NOTHING in them. You will literally see a huge menu with only one option and no tooltips or anything. Oh and remember all those lovely hotkeys that every relatively new rts has? That's right you guessed it, this game has none.

As I'm sure you've noticed, this is quite an angry review and has turned into a rant rather than an objective review. BUT, after having played a few skirmishes against the so called 'a.i.' I felt compelled to try and save you from the dreadful experience that lies ahead.

I somehow managed to get it for 6 euros and I still feel cheated. This game is so pre-alpha that no one should ever be able to buy it until they at least remove all the bugs and arrange the ai and interface.

Save yourself and your wallet, do not waste money on this.

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.

I'm out."

There are many older castle/siege games available on the market that are better in content and gameplay.  Citadels gameplay was okay.  My main complaints were the ackwardness of some building upgrades and the low population cap.  Considering the amount of population required to maintain your economy, a cap of 99 people was maddening when trying to manage an army.  At first I assumed the population limit would increase as the campaign progressed but before I knew it the campaign was over and the cap never changed.  I played a couple skirmish/sandbox games.  The castle defense one was boring on normal difficulty.  I then tried a duel map and found it more fun.  Both maps had ackward terrain to build on.  Steep terrain is a pain to build walls on.  It usually requires building towers close together.  However, if you build towers to close together, you may be prevented from building walls between them too.
Overall, the game wasn't very fun to play and recommend playing other games out there.","Citadels has potential but it isn't worthy it's current cost.

Compared to other games of the same genre I would say it ranks around 30/100, due to how much it crashes I found myself loosing a lot of things done because I didn't save every freaking minute. 
There is no auto save option and no short key for saving either, which makes it pretty easy to forget to save when you're in the middle of building a decent city and a powerful army. 
I had to leave the game several times before having to reattempt a mission because I forgot to save and it just decided to crash on me, so trust me it can lead you to a rage quit :/
Building and Unit quality/content is quite poor, there is very little to do and explore.
The AI is completly retarded, they cannot carry out simple tasks like cutting a tree which you tell them to, instead they go off and cut down another tree miles away from where you told them to go.
The AI will very commonly forget where the resources are located despite their assigned work place being right next to it... In other words the AI behaves like a 3 year old for most of the time, which is my opinion is appaling for a game of this price.
The graphics aren't amazing, however in a strategy game I consider that to be the least important thing and having played strategy games for over 10 years I can still have fun in a game that reminds me of old experiences through its graphics.

I was expecting a clone of the Stronghold series, with perhaps some embelishments or improvements. This game provides neither. In fact, it can't even provide the basic expectations of an RTS game. After playing it for about an hour I was surprised to see this wasn't an 'Early Access' game, but instead claims to be 'complete.'  The game most lacks in its user interface (UI), which if improved, would bring it at least on par to other RTSes.

Areas for improvement: 
1. Double-clicking a control group (0-9) doesn't center on units. And there is no additional key to do so. This is unforgivable.
2. The game helpfully informs you that you are under attack. Hope you noticed that one minimap ping, because otherwise you're clicking through controls groups trying to find the one taking damage, and then remembering where that group is (see 1 above). There needs to be a 'zoom to last alert' key or equivalent. 
3. Speaking of minimap. When you have a unit selected, the unit info covers half of the minimap. You can hide the minimap, and the unit info. But maybe they should just make the unit info smaller... Or make the minimap movable?
4. Trees block building. And I didn't find a way to manually dfestroy a tree. I looked in the keybinds, and found what can be best called a 'minimalist' interface. You have WASD camera controls (not my cup of tea for an RTS, but whatever), control groups (0-9), and then a couple keys for peasant (resource gatherer) management. No attack-move, manual attack, zoom-to-unit, etc.

1. Le son des ouvriers au travail devient vite accablant, j'avais l'impression d'être en usine tant ça m'abrutissait, et j'imagine qu'un paquet de joueurs va vite couper le son juste pour ne plus entendre les bûcherons.
2. Des crashs réguliers, même avec des réglages assez bas, un jeu très instable donc, prompt à freeze & crash régulièrement.
Ajoutez à cela une tendance du terrain à se mettre en travers de vos murailles et à gâcher vos plans pour quelques pixels mal placés, et vous aurez vite fait de n'en plus pouvoir. Sans compter qu'à chaque fois, une bonne muraille devant connecter deux tours, ça vous oblige à démonter/remonter une tour au moins à chaque coup ; et à subir à nouveau le bruit des marteaux.","Even though it tends to be reminiscent of a good old Stronghold and allows you to build your own castle just the way you want it, Citadels suffers from some major problems. No, it's not the slightly outdated graphics, which, for me, are rather secondary and quite beautiful and well-designed. No, the game suffers from two major problems:
1. The sound of the workers at work quickly becomes overwhelming; I felt like I was in a factory, it was so mind-numbing, and I imagine a lot of players will quickly turn off the sound just to stop hearing the lumberjacks.
2. Regular crashes, even at fairly low settings, making the game very unstable, prone to freezing and crashing regularly.
Add to that a tendency for the terrain to get in the way of your walls and ruin your plans over a few poorly placed pixels, and you'll quickly be fed up. Not to mention that each time, a good wall having to connect two towers, it forces you to dismantle/reassemble at least one tower each time; and to suffer the noise of the hammers again."

When i saw this come rolling in, i guess i took the description the wrong way, as i assumed it would be more of a base-builder/town managment deal.  The kind where you focus more on building walls and planning your town than training troops and sending them to attack other groups on the map.  

Unfortunately, i was wrong, this plays like a plethora of other RTS games, all already established with their fans.  Much like the Age of Empires 2 HD i bought sometime back around the november-december sales.

I can't recommend it because this wasn't even what i was looking for, nor is it any better than other RTS games already available new or old.

It's not a bad game, some collision detection with your own units acts weird and the cursor doesn't seem to like being where it is at times, but it's nothing that won't likely be patched up by the time it's at an actual release version.

I click my worker, and it does not select him...i have to move the mouse about nearly an inch away from where i want to click for it to click the target, which made it extremely hard for me to click things and build my base, not to mention it takes about 45 minutes at least to establish enough of a base to start fighting. Thats too long for an RTS to build a base in my opinion.

I play warcraft 3, starcraft 2, age of empires, max it takes is 15-20 minutes to build a base and normally you already have units to fight by then as well....where as in citadels, it takes nearly 45 minutes to an hour to get there.

Other negative things i've found:
-Everytime you have a worker build something, no matter where it is, or what it is...one of them have to go all the way back to the town hall to get a sack of supplies, now if you build a decent size base, like most RTS players do, you end up waiting 30+ seconds for your worker to run there and back to the building you ordered them to build, which is really stupid in my opinion, it's suppose to be a real time strategy, not a peace treaty of 45+ minutes to build a base and an army of 149 (cap).

-Also, i noticed there seems to only be one map you can play skirmish on...big down fall.

-There are no playable customization/Races of any kind. Like warcraft 3 had Orcs, Humans, Night elf, and undead....where as this game has nothing but the same exact units for both you and your enemy. Very disappointing to me as an RTS player.

-The workers sometimes just stop building your buildings, i had one worker build me a moat, and i came back to see how it looks, and he just decided to never build it and stand there. What good are the workers if they don't work?

-For experienced RTS users like myself, we like to use hotkeys to build and command things, it makes it quicker and more efficient for us....there are NO hot keys in this game. You have to manually click each building you want, and wait.

Игра звезд с неба не хватает (я тут решил не медлить и сказать, что не такое уж и говно, даже играть интересно, просто не очень удобно...совсем не удобно). Начну с сюжета - жил был король Артур...бла-бла...потом (как всегда) все умерли (и король помер, пал среди первых), но рыцари круглого стола выжили (в значительно меньшем составе) и решили всех спасти. В принципе это весь сюжет, такие дела. И сразу к графике, я прекрасно понимаю, что для стратегии это не главное, но всё же, можно хоть немного блюра какого-нибудь или там текстур почетче. Геймплей стандартен - добываем ресурсы, строимся, нанимаем войска (переобучаем крестьян) и мочим врага. Ага, вот тут-то и подвох - хрен вам, а не спокойные нервы, игра очень неудобна во всех аспектах. Изволите строить - вам будут нужны способности ясновидения, ибо простая логика не срабатывает (блджад, почему камень добывают в яме, а не в каменоломне???). Ни каких подписей и подсказок, только намеки и недомолвки. Не знаю даже, но наверное, поиграть все же стоит, ну или хотя бы попробовать, очень спорно.

Догони катапульту! 5,5 из 10 :)","A practically digestible RTS.

The game isn't exactly a smash hit (I'll just jump right in and say it's not all that bad, it's even fun to play, it's just not very user-friendly... not user-friendly at all). I'll start with the plot: once upon a time, King Arthur... blah blah... then (as always) everyone died (and the king died, among the first to fall), but the Knights of the Round Table survived (in significantly smaller numbers) and decided to save everyone. That's basically the whole plot, that's it. And now, let's move on to the graphics. I understand that for a strategy game, they're not the most important thing, but they could have used at least a bit of blur or sharper textures. The gameplay is standard: gather resources, build, recruit troops (retrain peasants), and destroy the enemy. Yeah, that's the catch – no peace of mind, the game is incredibly awkward in every aspect. If you're going to build something, you'll need clairvoyant abilities, because simple logic won't work (damn, why do they mine stone from a pit and not a quarry???). There are no captions or clues, only hints and omissions. I don't even know, but it's probably worth playing, or at least trying, it's highly debatable.

At 75% off this game is a steal.

Patch Update: As of patch 3.9.2 the game has really begun to take a good form. You can increase the unit count in Skirmish maps (max was 99, now is 149), the campaign (which is almost bug free as far as completion goes) is easy enough with the current 99 cap imo. The tooltips in both the UI and unit feedback is much improved. You can finally set your hotkeys to what you want. (units are still a bit too silent for my liking, not gamebreaking though) There are still some things that aren't explained fully during gameplay, (the upgrade button comes to mind) but most of those are easy enough to figure out on your own.

The graphics, combat, and physics are cleaner/smoother making for a much better experience. And there are more updates on the way.

Not to say its bug free yet. But this game is getting much improved as the patches go along. If you haven't looked at this game for a while, I would urge you to do so, you just might be suprised.

Now if they would add more skirmish maps!....Or randomise them.

Original Review:
To start, yes, there are bugs, (Booo....UI can be a hard one to get a hold of, and tooltips aren't really tippy...) but so far nothing game breaking (knock on wood). But I am amazed on how the game works. 

Building is phenominal. 

Gather the resource, and once the resource building is full, bring it to your town center. 

Want to build a building? The builder needs to grab the materials, then go to the build site. 

Don't like the building there? Can't hit delete. You need to deconstruct buildings, which takes time, so place carefully. 

Walls are finally a laborious task to build, no more destroy a wall and build it 2 seconds later.

Train your units? Tell them to go to the training center, not just pop out of thin air.

Want better stuff? Refine your mats.

My only beef is how moats work (almost pointless) and walls, to be effective, need to be ended with a tower, and gates can only be placed on towers (but i guess when you see how they are built, its understandable)

The combat is a bit iffy, so if your looking for a deep combat game like the early strongholds, its not quite that refined, but its still a blast.

Given the game isn't MP at all, and it still has some wrinkles to iron out, it may not be worth 40 to most people, but if your able to get it on sale (got mine for 32 at GMG and couldn't be happier) please go for it.

Now all that's left is to wait for dozens of patches to make this game even remotely playable and enjoyable, even though I have the feeling the devs fled with the cash to some remote location in Mexico.

Well look elsewhere, because Citadels is a dreadful and incomplete mess. The game was created by an unknown and inexperienced development studio called Games Distillery. Currently a different studio called Big Moon was hired to add further playability and stability to the game. In the future, at best you can only hope for a polished yet dreadful entertainment product (without the entertainment value). 

Citadels attempts to accomplish what so many other strategy games have already done before, and it accomplishes those things poorly. Citadels most closely resembles a stripped down Age of Empires title. Everything from base building, combat, and resource gathering are implemented poorly. There is no strategy involved at all because combat boils down to spamming units. You can literally spam the most basic miliary unit available and win every time. The utter lack of military units available leaves no room for strategy, tactics, or planning at all. 

The game has a boring campaign that currently can't even be finished entirely, and a few lacklusted skirmish modes with terrible AI. There is only one map available per skirmish mode and no matter the difficulty you choose you cannot lose due to the incompetent AI. Citadels is only a singleplayer game so these are your only options. There is no map or scenario editor or multiplayer of any kind. The poor quality of this title combined with the utterlack of content at a $40 price point is downright theivery. Avoid at all costs.

I only put 3 hours into this game but that was rather generous of me. The boring gameplay, poor design, and lack of content leave little reason for me to play any further.","Have you been looking for a new real time strategy game lately to scratch that strategy itch you've been having?

StrongHoldに近いDeffenciveメインなRTSゲーム
資源回収→建造→防衛or攻撃のプロセスで相手の陣地を破壊すれば勝利

良い点を挙げたい所であるが欠点が目立ちすぎるのが悲しい所
バグ修正で急いでゲームを完成品にすると開発元は言ってはいるが如何せんこの値段なのが酷い
20-30ドルのプライス帯のゲームならそこまで言わないのだが+10でXCOM：EnemyTerritoryが買えた事を考えると怒りたくもなる
同価格以下ならAoE2や3も買えるしRTSとして39ドルと言う価値を為していない

欠点ばかり挙げ連なっているが致命的な点として下記を挙げる
1.ホットキーの設定不可
RTSとして致命的
そしてホットキーが何に対応しているかがマウスオーバーでも見る事が出来ない
マニュアルにもゲーム内オプションにも明らかに少なすぎるホットキーの記載

2.シングル専門にしてはお粗末過ぎるAI
農民をいきなり開幕から陣地に送り込んできてハラスをしてくる
更に殴られてる農民はデフォルトの設定なら反撃をしないのでAIのやってくる農民ハラスの鬱陶しさ
かと言って攻撃モードにしたらしたで農民がハラス対応にかまけだすので内政が完全に止まる本末転倒具合
弓兵を数人置くだけで何故か相手が運んでる資源まで落としだすのでAIの設定が明らかにおかしいと言わざるを得ない
しかも農民ハラスに弓兵で対抗しているとカタパルト等、攻城兵器を持ち出してくるが防衛が農民なので・・・以下略である

3.RTSとしてはお粗末過ぎるミニマップと建造位置の把握のし辛さ
一番の不満
資源表示も分かりにくいため何処に何があるのか把握が難しい上、上記の農民ハラスによる面倒さでイライラする仕様
更に攻撃をされた場合「Under attack」と表示される割にミニマップで攻撃されたポイントが把握し辛いため（効果音もほとんどならない）
至る所に弓兵を置く羽目になるが上記の仕様のためすり抜けたりすると内政地帯がてんやわんやになっていたりする
そのため壁と塔を配置しようとすると建造地点が非常に分かりづらいため弓兵を配置した方が早かったりする
塔だけ建ててカタパルトとバリスタ置いておくのが一番マシ

4.テンポが悪すぎる
一番致命的なポイント
StrongHoldは一戦に時間がかかると言えど、散発的な戦闘や内政などは迅速な対応を求められるゲームであった
尚且つ、そこに対応出来る良UIであり、センスやミニマップの出来も非常に良かった
更には速度も可変出来たので長い内政などは速度を最高速にしたりで迅速なゲーム展開も可能では有った
がこのゲームではそういったことは不可能である
StrongHoldが退化した中でPVを見る限りStrongHoldオマージュとして非常に良い出来なのかと思っただけに悲しみを覚える

総括すると39ドルもこの出来で取ろうとしたBitGamesに拍手を送りたい
PVみたいな派手な戦闘や防衛はキャンペーンだけだ安心しろ","It's not worth the full price. Sadly, but it's true.

A defensive-focused RTS game similar to Stronghold.
You win by destroying the enemy's base through the process of resource collection, construction, defense, or attack.

I'd like to point out the good points, but the flaws are too obvious.
The developer says they're rushing to fix bugs and make the game a finished product, but the price is just terrible.
I wouldn't say that much about a game in the $20-$30 price range, but when I think about the fact that I could have bought XCOM: Enemy Territory for just $10, it makes me angry.
You can also buy Area of ​​Exile 2 and 3 for the same price or less, so this RTS isn't worth the $39 price tag.

I've listed a lot of flaws, but here are the most critical ones:
1. No hotkey settings.
This is a fatal flaw for an RTS.
2. You can't see what the hotkeys correspond to by hovering your mouse over them.
3. It's not clear in the manual or in-game options. The list of hotkeys is far too limited.

2. The AI ​​is too poor for a single-player game.
They send peasants straight into your base right from the start to harass you.
Furthermore, peasants being attacked don't retaliate under default settings, so the AI's peasant harassment is annoying.
However, if you switch to attack mode, the peasants become so preoccupied with responding to the harassment that your domestic affairs grind to a halt, completely upending the game's priorities.
For some reason, just placing a few archers will cause the enemy to drop even the resources they're carrying, so I have to say the AI ​​settings are clearly flawed.
Furthermore, if you counter the peasant harassment with archers, they'll bring out siege weapons like catapults, but the defense is made up of peasants... etc.

3. The minimap is far too poor for an RTS, and it's difficult to understand building locations.
My biggest complaint:
The resource display is confusing, making it hard to know where things are, and the peasant harassment is annoying.
Furthermore, if you're attacked, you'll get the ""Underground"" command. Despite the ""attack"" message being displayed, it's difficult to see the attacked point on the minimap (there's almost no sound effect).
You'll end up placing archers everywhere, but if they slip through, the civil affairs zone will become chaotic.
As a result, when trying to place walls and towers, it's very difficult to determine where they're built, so it's often quicker to just place archers.
It's best to just build towers and place catapults and ballistae.

4. The tempo is too poor.
The most critical point.
Although Stronghold battles take a long time, sporadic combat and civil affairs require quick response. It was a game that could handle that.
It also had a good UI that could handle it, and the sense and minimap were very well done.
Furthermore, the speed could be adjusted, so for long domestic affairs, you could set it to maximum speed and quickly progress through the game.
But that's not possible in this game.
While Stronghold has regressed, watching the promotional video, I thought it would be a very good homage to Stronghold, so I'm sad.

Overall, I applaud BitGames for trying to make $39 with this.
Don't worry, the flashy battles and defenses you see in the promotional video are only in the campaign."
