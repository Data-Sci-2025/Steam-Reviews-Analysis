189112254,english,2025.02.02 03:15,❌,✅,0.5,0,Welp my journey came to an end and I have a bunch to say about this. Everytime I built a Skyscraper it was always the same experience of buying vehicles which are not driven by anyone in them.  Then your hiring workers for the jobs and then you just sit back and relax or at least you would be if it was not so dull. There were so many instances where the building took so slow to build that I either went to brush my teeth or take a shower. And as a plus whenever I was building 3 skyscrapers at the same time my game kept on crashing and it was annoying. I had a long journey but now I can put this game to rest. This game does make sense to once have a 6% rating and once considered the worst game on Steam.,Welp my journey came to an end and I have a bunch to say about this.

101957439,german,2021.09.31 16:11,❌,✅,0.6660949588,12,"""Skyscraper Simulator"" ist so was wie ein Bau-Management Spielchen.

Auf einer pixeligen Karte von New York, die an eine schlechte Google-Earth Aufnahme erinnert wählen wir uns einen von sieben Bauplätzen aus. Dann kaufen wir uns ein paar Baufahrzeuge aus fünf Kategorien, stellen ein paar Arbeiter und Ingenieure ein und verteilen die auf die unterschiedlichen Arbeitsbereiche. Und dann...

Und dann warten wir. Dann starren wir fünfzehn Minuten auf eine grottig animierte Baustelle und warten, bis sich im Schneckentempo ein häßlicher Wolkenkratzer in die Höhe schraubt. Und fünfzehn Minuten dauert es bei höchster Geschwindigkeit. Zu tun gibt es für uns so gut wie nichts, außer vielleicht ein paar Arbeiter je nach Bauphase hin und her schieben. 

Nach diesen fünfzehn Warteminuten liefert unser Wolkenkratzer regelmäßig Einnahmen, mit denen wir uns neue Baugebiete kaufen können und neue Wolkenkratzer in Auftrag geben können, auf die wir dann wieder eine Viertelstunde warten müssen. 

Das ist weder herausfordernd noch ansatzweise interessant. 

Welcher Wahnsinnige ist nur auf die Schnapsidee gekommen, aus solch einem absurd schlechten Konzept, wirklich ein Spiel zu machen. Weder als Spiel noch als Simulation ist dieses Etwas auch nur ansatzweise interessant. Es ist weder realistisch noch unterhaltsam. Es ist einfach eine völlig gescheiterte Schnapsidee.

Oder anders formuliert: es ist ein verdammt häßlicher Bildschirmschoner, bei dem man alle paar Minuten mal irgendwo draufklickt.

[h1]Fazit:[/h1]
Pleite-Bau.

[h1][b]2/10 Gesamtwertung","""Skyscraper Simulator"" is something like a construction management game.

On a pixelated map of New York, reminiscent of a bad Google Earth image, we choose one of seven construction sites. Then we buy a few construction vehicles from five categories, hire a few workers and engineers, and assign them to the various work areas. And then...

And then we wait. Then we stare for fifteen minutes at a crappy, animated construction site, waiting for an ugly skyscraper to rise at a snail's pace. And it takes fifteen minutes at top speed. There's practically nothing for us to do, except maybe move a few workers around depending on the construction phase.

After these fifteen minutes of waiting, our skyscraper regularly generates income, which we can use to buy new construction sites and commission new skyscrapers, for which we then have to wait another fifteen minutes.

That's neither challenging nor even remotely interesting.

What kind of madman came up with the crazy idea of ​​actually making a game out of such an absurdly bad concept? Neither as a game nor as a simulation is this thing even remotely interesting. It's neither realistic nor entertaining. It's simply a completely failed idea.

Or to put it another way: it's a damn ugly screensaver that makes you click on something every few minutes.

Yes, the game description and the game itself do not match 1-1. But, it does deliver on a decent simulation experience. There is consistency and simplicity. There is good documentation for any new or returning player to understand the game.

The Game: You manage the procurement and allocation of resources (both people and machines) in order to build a skyscraper. There is a small chunk of New York, I think, where you can purchase plots and construct skyscrapers. I believe there is a limit of 10 structures/plots you can own. The game is progressive when it comes to plots and projects. There are a couple of skyscraper designs (I have come by about 6 so far and they all look great). I still have to reach the endgame, if there is any.

PROS - Simple game, easy instructions, rinse and repeat gameplay, decent graphics, simple management
CONS - Game differs from description, some bugs where game freezes, too repetitive

tl;dr - Decent game that differs from it's description. Has a few bugs but delivers on simple management and simulation. This may not be everyone's cup of tea :)","I purchased this game a while ago and recall having quite a few optimization issues when playing on windows 7.

Aside from the bugs that may be experienced (and those are a massive drawback i'm not gonna lie), it's not as boring as many people made it sound like. It's an easy game that doesn't require loads of skills, that's true, but if one wants to achieve the best result with the least expenses has actually to fiddle a little with the workers management and the machinery to use.
Perhaps the only two complains i can have about the gameplay are the amount of time one requires to get the needed funds to build the next skyscraper and the fact that once you build them all it's over.
My solution to the first problem is renting the buildings and letting the game run while i do something else (like studying or eating dinner for example).
In conclusion, not bad at all to me, especially for just the small price it has.","Ok, i'll be 100% honest, no joke review or anything: I actually enjoy the game.

Do I recommend this game to people who like a lot of things going on with plenty to do and a great experience? no.

I'm simple. I have things I like about this game, like the strategic economic decisions you gotta make in order to plan ahead and make dough. There's a lot of things this game lacks that could've made this game better to understand and navigate, and over all just play better.

the buttons are tiny, there needs to be more stats (such as when rent is collected, how many tenants you have by your price, what upgrading will do), more detail on workers, and all together, more details on graphics.

you're either looking at the city, or at construction view. the construction view looks like a tiny sky island away from any city because its barren. When you buy a skyscraper, it disappears from the map when I wish it just became a different color and you could still click on it.

I like how there are actions the machines make to show theyre moving around and working, but its limited and usually at the edge. escavating is good, because it digs it out. but when the base and concrete is placed, it looks just like the dirt you dug out. 

when the skyscraper is being built, its not bad graphic wise. though it would be cool if it was more detailed, especially towards the end. Like, some touch ups or even pathways, trees, and other decorations would be nice. You know, so it looks like it's being added to a city.

the rent takes f o r e v e r. When you need to make money fast enough to start a new sky scraper and not lose because of bankruptcy, this game will make you wait hours. 

Honestly, this game in general (though based on real time economics and speed) needs to be so much faster.

anyways, I hope the creators haven't given up on this, because I respect the work they put into it, and I hope they work to make it more enjoyable

baue einen wolkenkratzer in südmanhattan. stelle leute ein, kaufe fahrzeuge und teile sie für die bauphasen ein. klingt im ersten moment ziemlich cool. mal was neues verglichen zu den anderen aufbau-sim-spielen. das prinzip erinnerte mich sehr an simtower aus meiner jugend^^

ist der wolkenkratzer fertig, kann man nicht viel mit ihm machen. entweder man vermietet ihn (automatisiert) oder man verkauft ihn. will man dann einen weiteren bauen, muss man erstmal ziemlich viel zeit vergehen lassen, bis man sich ihn finanztechnisch leisten kann. man ist also gezwungen das spiel eine stunde auf schnellvorlauf zu bringen, da man ansonsten bankrott geht, wenn man mit weniger als 30mio den bau startet. dann hat man durch mieteinnahmen genug kohle um einen weiteren zu bauen. ist der zweite fertig, braucht man sich ansich keine großen sorgen mehr ums geld machen, da man mit 1,5 mio $ wocheneinnahmen sich nicht mehr groß ums geld sorgen muss, da der bau des wolkenkratzers locker 1 jahr spielzeit und mehr dauert. 

weiter hab ich nicht gespielt, da man leider keine richtig großen teile bauen kann. maximal knapp 300m sind möglich, was doch sehr sehr bescheiden für new york city ist...

dennoch kann ich dieses spiel empfehlen, da der preis mit 3 € preis/leistungs-technisch sehr fair ist. wer kurz mal etwas neues spielen will und seine erwartungen nicht so hoch ansetzt, wird sicher nicht enttäuscht. wer aber pfennigfuchser ist und für 3€ stundenlang zocken will, wird masslos enttäuscht werden^^","Pretty tight gameplay. It's already been described in other reviews. But here's my take on this game:

Build a skyscraper in South Manhattan. Hire people, buy vehicles, and assign them to the construction phases. Sounds pretty cool at first. Something new compared to other construction sim games. The concept reminded me a lot of SimTower from my youth^^

Once the skyscraper is finished, you can't do much with it. You either rent it out (automatically) or sell it. If you then want to build another one, you have to let a lot of time pass until you can afford it financially. So you're forced to fast-forward the game an hour, otherwise you'll go bankrupt if you start construction with less than 30 million. Then you'll have enough money from rental income to build another one. Once the second one is finished, you don't really need to worry too much about money anymore, since with a weekly income of $1.5 million, you don't have to worry too much about money anymore, as building the skyscraper easily takes a year or more of playtime.

I didn't play any further, because unfortunately, you can't build really large parts. A maximum of just under 300 meters is possible, which is very, very modest for New York City...

Nevertheless, I can recommend this game, as the price of €3 is very fair in terms of value. Anyone who wants to play something new for a short time and doesn't have too high expectations will certainly not be disappointed. However, anyone who's a penny pincher and wants to play for hours for €3 will be immensely disappointed.^^"

It doesn't crash a lot for me and it is challenging and rewarding enough to be worth giving a shot. And, it's super cheap, so you're not giving up that much money if you don't like it. However, that being said, I do have my problems.

1: The Graphics
This game has basicly poop graphics. Even on the highest settings, it still looks like ass.
2: The End Game
For this type of game, I don't feel it should have an endgame. It flies in the face of strategy. I do think the ""High score"" think is nice, but you should be able to go for atleast the whole of your city before the game ends.
A good game to compare this to is Game Dev Tycoon. They are both strategy games. However, in Game Dev Tycoon, not only does it never truely end, but the end of new things end game takes a while to get to. In this game you could get there in like 10 minutes if you tried.
3: Gameplay
I feel that it's too simplistic for people to keep coming back to it. I'll compare it again to Game Dev Tycoon. In Game Dev Tycoon, it's simple enough for people to get the hang of it right away, but it's challenging enough that it takes many attemps to get to the end, each one longer than the last, building up to hours upon hours poured in. In this game, in a few hours you could realize what you need to do to ensure you make it to the end. After that point, there's no point in playing much more.

I would appreciate comments. I hope this helps you make an informed choice to get this game or not. I reccomend it as a small strategy time-waster, however, I am in the vast minority.","In my experiance, this game is a decent strategy game.

You start as a construction company AND real-estate holding group. You are buying land in this fictional city. Choose a plot, send in excavators and dump trucks to dig out a foundation pit, send in cement mixers and trucks to pour a foundation, then build cranes. to both build floors and extend the interior until the whole thing's build. Sounds execiting, but the reality is there are MAJOR simplifications as well as some really lame attempt at creating complexities. 

For example, let's say you need excavators and dump trucks to start digging the foundation pit. You get to choose from various excavators available, and each of them have 3 ratings: efficiency / condition / price. The difference in price between least and most efficient is no more than 20% of the price (60K for efficiency 1/5 vs 90K for 5/5) , so there's really no reason to penny pinch.  Why would any one hire anything less than peak efficiency? Condition is likelihood of breaking down, and can be minimized by assigning more people to the maintainence staff. So basically the idea is hire enough dump trucks to keep X number of excavators busy. 

Once the pit's excavated you hire cement trucks and a foundation team to pour the foundation.  If you have another buidling you are working on, you can send the crew that worked at your site A to your site B, otherwise. you just ""sell"" the equipment and buy new ones when you need to. 

Then when that's complete, you hire cargo trucks and cranes to build the actual skyscraper. You will definitely need more than one crane, as you have two simultaneous teams: a steel frame team and a floor team, and you need to assign cranes to them separately. If you don't, the whole construction stops and you get no error messages. You'll also need cargo trucks to supply the cranes. 

The vehicles to move around the lot a bit and the excavators do dig, the cranes move, but you can speed through that. You can optimize the workflow by adding workers to eliminate some bottlenecks, or you can even add equipment to make the whole thing faster. 

But what do the finished buildings actually do? You can set its lease rate, so you have monthly income, and when you are ready, you can sell the whole thing for a nice sump of cash. However, you are not given hint on whehter the lease income is covering your construction expenses, and so on and so forth. This is not construction biz tycoon. In fact, there are ZERO spreadsheets in this game, nor any graphs. All you have about your financial wellbeing is your ""current balance"" (which I assume to be ""cash""?) as if it goes to zero, the game ends. And as you can probably guess, there is no loan or deficit spending. 

So the ""simulator"" basically consists of clicking on some tables (ordering equipment) then click on FAST FORWARD to watch ""timelapse"" of the equipment you ordered come to your lot, start digging and constructing.

[h1]Об игре:[/h1]
Очередной шлак от UIG. Все, как всегда, и вы можете прочитать любой из моих обзоров на любую из игр данного разработчика-издателя. Думал написать о теории откуда берутся такие игры, но в одном из обзоров это уже было изложено в комментах. Каждый раз писать о том какая куча фекалий перед нами ничего не меняя кроме названия игры? Надоело. Спасение я нашел в новой рубрике. Ведь анекдот куда интереснее прочитать, чем десять тысяч слов, почему навоз является навозом. Я думаю никто в комментах к играм UIG не ищет ничего интересного кроме негатива.

Женщина рожает на улице. Идет панк.
Женщина:
- Помогите!
Панк:
- Дык, че делать-то?
Женщина:

[h1]About the game:[/h1]
Another piece of trash from UIG. It's business as usual, and you can read any of my reviews of any game from this developer/publisher. I thought about writing about the theory behind such games, but it was already explained in the comments in one of the reviews. Writing about the pile of feces in front of us every time, without changing anything except the game's name? I'm tired of it. I found salvation in a new section. After all, a joke is much more interesting to read than ten thousand words about why manure is manure. I don't think anyone in the comments of UIG games is looking for anything interesting except negativity.

A woman gives birth in the street. Punk is in full swing. Woman:
- Help!
Punk:
- So, what should we do?
Woman:
- Pull the kid by the head!

- Oops! I pulled him out!
Woman:
- Grab him by the legs and spank him!
Punk (giving the kid a hard spank):
- And don't let him go there again!

Das Spiel macht genau das was der Developer hier geschrieben hat.

Man fängt an mit 25 Mio in der Tasche und sucht sich seinen ersten Bauplatz, ab besten den günstigsten in der Baxter Street.
Ist man ab Bauplatz werden Verwaltung und Mechaniker voll besetzt.
Dann sucht man sich einen Bagger und 1-2 Kipper aus, die möglichst hohe Werte haben.
Sobald diese angeliefert wurden, packt man je einen Vorarbeiter und 10 Bauarbeiter auf jedes Fahrzeug.

Dann kommt das was die meisten scheinbar nicht mögen, man muss warten das das Team mit buddeln fertig ist.
Ich empfehle pro Bagger 2 Kipper und Speed auf Stufe 2, dann dauert das nicht lange und das Warten ist ja nicht schlimm, es ist in etwa wie Armeisen beobachten.
Dazu die wummernde  Musik die für einen Simulationstitel ungewöhnlich gut ist.

Ist die Grube ausgehoben, wird das Fundament und dann das Haus gebaut.
Was iich hier Seltsam finde, das erst eine Baugrube in der Größe eines Fußballplatzes ausgehoben wird, dann wird ein kleines Fundament da reingestellt und die Betonmischer sorgen dann nicht dafür das das Fundament entsteht, das ist ja schon da, sondern die aufgebuddelte Baugrube ""wächst"" um das Fundament rum wieder zu.
Auch seltsam ist, wenn die Arbeiten fertig sind werden alle Fahrzeuge verkauft und alle Arbeiter entlassen.
Man fängt also bei jedem Gebäude von vorne an, statt das Team auf eine neue Baustelle zu schicken.
Laut Spiel geht das nur manuell, indem man das Fahrzeug anklickt und Transport wählt.
Macht man das nicht vor Fertigstellung des Gebäudes so werden die verkauft.

Ist das Haus fertig lässt man das Spiel einfach ein Stündchen inb der Stadtansicht stehen, bis die Miete genug neues Kapital in die Kasse gespühlt hat, ich habe zb für das 2. Haus 75 Mio über, kann also richtig kleckern mit Geld.
Was passiert wenn man das Haus verkauft, weis ich nicht, es wäre aber komisch wenn das haus dann verschwindet und man es noch einmal bauen kann.

Was ich noch gut finden würde, das Arbeiter sichtbar rumlaufen, besserer und sichtbarer Bau des Fundament, eine Stadtansicht mit hochwertigeren Texturen (sieht aus wie Google Earth mit 3D Gebäuden) und eventuell mehr Einfluss auf diverse Dinge und einen Tag/Nacht Modus.

Man muss viel warten, aber wer Aufbauspiele auf dem Handy mag, das hier ist nicht viel anders, nur das das Spiel hier einem keinen Echtgeldshop vor die Nase haut.
Alleine die Musik ist schon das Geld wert.
Ist zwar nicht so umfangreich wie ein Landwirtschafts Simulator, aber hier bekommt man wenigstens was versprochen wird und keine falschen Versprechungen oder ein Spiel voller Bugs.

Habe noch einen bug gefunden, da spielen mehrere Stücke der Musik gleichzeitig, Neustart des Spiel half nicht.
Zudem kann man Spielstände nicht übewrschreiben oder löschen und ein Autosave wäre sicherlich auch angemessen.","You shouldn't criticize the game just because it isn't packed with options.
The game does exactly what the developer wrote here.

You start with 25 million in your pocket and look for your first building site, ideally the cheapest one on Baxter Street.
Once you're at the building site, the administration and mechanics are fully staffed.
Then you choose an excavator and 1-2 dump trucks with the highest possible stats.
Once these have been delivered, you put a foreman and 10 construction workers on each vehicle.

Then comes what most people apparently don't like: you have to wait for the team to finish digging.
I recommend 2 dump trucks per excavator and speed at level 2. Then it doesn't take long, and the wait isn't so bad; it's kind of like watching ants.
Add to that the thumping music, which is unusually good for a simulation title.

Once the pit is dug, the foundation and then the house are built. What I find strange here is that first a pit the size of a football field is dug, then a small foundation is placed in it, and then the concrete mixers don't create the foundation, which is already there, but rather the dug pit ""grows back up"" around the foundation.
Also strange is that once the work is finished, all vehicles are sold and all workers are laid off.
So you start over with each building instead of sending the team to a new construction site.
According to the game, this can only be done manually by clicking on the vehicle and selecting transport.
If you don't do this before the building is completed, they will be sold.

Once the house is finished, you simply leave the game in the city view for an hour until the rent has brought in enough new capital. For example, I have 75 million left over for the second house, so I can really make money.
I don't know what happens if you sell the house, but it would be weird if the house disappeared and you could build it again.

What I would also like is visible workers walking around, better and more visible foundation construction, a city view with higher-quality textures (looks like Google Earth with 3D buildings), and possibly more control over various things, and a day/night mode.

You have to wait a lot, but if you like building games on your phone, this one isn't much different, except that the game doesn't shove a real-money shop in your face.
The music alone is worth the money.
It's not as comprehensive as a Farming Simulator, but at least here you get what's promised and not false promises or a game full of bugs.

I also found a bug where several music tracks play at the same time; restarting the game didn't help.
Also, you can't overwrite or delete saved games, and an autosave would certainly be appropriate."

Hat das Spiel was Gutes? - Ich weiß es nicht...

Ich habe mir das Werk eine 3/4 Stunde lang angeschaut und konnte erfolgreich einen Wolkenkratzer hochziehen.

Aber nun ja... 
Das Spiel besteht eigentlich nur daraus, Fahrzeuge für die jeweiligen Bauphasen (Baugrube, Fundament und Konstruktion) zu kaufen. Diesen kann man dann in einer wunderschönen Dauerschleifen Animation zuschauen wie sie aus der Baustelle heraus und wieder herein fahren. 

Ich bin schon die ganze Zeit am überlegen was für Punkte an dem Spiel positiv sind... es gibt aber einfach keine. 
Das Spiel ist einfach nur Schrott.

Ich habe es zum Glück geschenkt bekommen, denn 3,99 € für eine Hand voll lieblos hingeklatschten Copy-and-Paste Texturen ist einfach nur zu viel. Da kaufe ich mir lieber ""Plug & Play"", denn davon habe ich noch was im Nachhinein.

[b][u]Fazit:[/u][/b] Das Spiel ist keinen Cent wert und wer es doch spielen möchte braucht einen riesen Vorrat an Geduld.","The ""Skyscraper Simulator,"" a simulator that, for whatever reason, can be called a simulator.
Is there anything good about the game? - I don't know...

I watched the game for 45 minutes and was able to successfully build a skyscraper.

But anyway...
The game basically just consists of buying vehicles for the respective construction phases (excavation, foundation, and construction). You can then watch them drive in and out of the construction site in a beautiful looping animation.

I've been trying to figure out what the game's positives are... but there simply aren't any.

The game is just garbage.

I'm lucky I got it for free, because €3.99 for a handful of carelessly slapped-on copy-and-paste textures is just too much. I'd rather buy ""Plug & Play,"" because I'll still get some of that later.

チュートリアル代わりにヘルプが表示されているだけだが、初期資金はそれなりにあるため、割と適当に言われたとおりやっていてもなんとかなる。300万で買った土地が何もせずに500万で売れたりする謎のバランスなのはさておき、そもそもやれることが少なく、適切な人材配置をして後は放置して眺めるだけのゲーム。一度完成してしまったビルは貸し出すか売るかしか出来ず、完成直後以外は見ることさえ出来ない。ちゃんとした敷地のグラフィックを用意していないためなのだろうが、流石に完成品を即没収されるようであまり気分は良くない。
ビルが生えていく様子を眺めるの自体は楽しいが、グラフィックの貧弱さゆえ2本目辺りでそれも飽きるのでやることもなくなる寿命の短いゲーム。

セール時でもあまりオススメは出来ない。","This is a simulation game where you watch skyscrapers being built. You buy land, set the residential/commercial ratio and price range, and arrange and allocate personnel and equipment to proceed with construction. You can operate the heavy machinery yourself, but it's largely pointless.
Help is displayed in lieu of a tutorial, but since you have a decent amount of initial capital, you can get by by following instructions roughly. Aside from the odd balance—land purchased for 3 million can be sold for 5 million without any effort—there's not much to do in the first place; all you do is assign personnel appropriately and then leave it alone and watch. Once a building is completed, you can only rent or sell it, and you can only see it immediately after completion. This is probably because the site graphics aren't properly designed, but it feels like your finished product is being immediately confiscated, which isn't a very pleasant feeling.
While watching the buildings grow is fun, the poor graphics make it boring after the second game, and there's nothing to do with it, making it a short-lived game.

Second, Gameplay: I, for one, was ready to face the challenges of building a Skyscraper over New York City. What I wasn't ready for is some of the WORST GAMEPLAY I EVER EXPERICES IN A SIMULATOR! EVER! I can't even discribed the gameplay, except for this: AVOID IT AT ALL COST!

Well, maybe one more thing about the Gameplay though is: WHAT THE HELL IS THEIR A HIGH SCORE IN THE GAME? NO ONE IS GOING TO PLAY THIS PIECE OF SHIT! 

And lastly, Sound: .....CUT MY EARS INTO PIECES, THIS IS MY LAST RESORT! DEAFNESS, NO HEARING, DON'T GIVE A FUCK IF MY HEAD ARE BLEEDING!

DON'T BUY THIS SHIT!
-10/10 FUCK IT! FUCK IT TO HELL!"

There are fairly clear directions that pop on the screen (are easily removable/recallable) telling you what to do.  [The biggest complaint I've read was that equipment was purchased in perfect condition, but then was rated horribly.  You have to fill the equipment with people by going to the lower selections and highering people.]  I built 8 skyscrappers in probably 7 hours of real playing time (at my computer).  The only thing I didn't read, but easily figured out was when you reach a maximium of 6 properties, you have to stop 'renting' one out and sell it.

As you successfully build them, more properities around the city and more varied designs become available to build with.

The game does not come without flaws though.  There are bugs, but none that crashed my computer or prevented me from playing at all.  One was a display of my money in the upper right where it'd keep jittering every once in a while.  Another was where I built a skyscrapper on Battery Park and when it completed it (though still listing it as the Battery Park location), placed it in the middle of central NYC.  It also enlarged it by a factor of 3.  (There are screen caps in my profile on the game).  (Note: after building the next skyscrapper, it did reset the size of the one to a normal level.)

All in all, it's not horrible.  I got it as part of a bundle and took a chance, despite the reviews.  I played on a lower end laptop and though lowering the video graphics on it to it's lowest setting, it all ran smooth.  The biggest complaint of mine was the factor of time.  You often would basically set everything up to build and then just fast forward.  Which when doing so, still took a long while even at a factor of x10.  Again, it's not the world's worst game as the ratings indicate.  It's playable and kinda fun.  It's not intricate or mindblowing on dynamics.

Installavi tutto quello che dovevi installare, controllavi i requisiti di sistema e non andava. Come me, centinaia di altre persone. Ero arrabbiato. Fuioso. Tanto che, quando non sapevo cosa fare, decideo di scaricare questo gioco per vedere se partiva. Oggi è partito, non si sa perché, non so come, ma è partito. L'assistenza del produttore per problemi tecnici si descrive con una parola ""inesistente"". Ma andiamo avanti. Quando ero piccolo nel 1994, c'era Sim Tower, edito dalla Maxis, dove si costruiva un grattacielo e lo si doveva gestire, decidendo, piano per piano, che destinazione dargli, se ospedale, appartamenti, uffici, negozi ecc. ed era un gioco molto carino e divertente. Oggi c'è Skyscraper Simulator, che non centra assolutamente niente con il primo, a parte l'ambientazione con i grattacieli. Qui non simuli un grattacielo malgrado il titolo lo lasci intendere, ma sei un costruttore di grattacieli. Li costruisci, li vendi e li affitti. Fare attenzione al costo, deve essere giusto, non troppo alto, rimarreste senza clienti, né troppo basso, andreste in perdita, e dovrete mantenere un'occhio ai costi di costruzione, altrimenti potreste finire in rosso e sono guai. Detto così sembra divertente, insomma sono un amante del genere tycoon, quindi, dov'è il problema?
Il problema è che fa schifo. Non solo rischiate di spendere i soldi per un gioco che non partirà senza motivo valido, ma se parte rischiate scoprirete che è pure noioso. Brutto. Scadente. Non ve lo consiglio. Qui non siamo di fronte ad un gioco di serie B, ma siamo andati molto più in basso, è un gioco di serie Z. Non lo consiglio a nessuno, anzi lo consiglio a chi lo ha prodotto, così che si possa rendere conto di quali schifezze mentte in commercio.","It took me several months to play it, I'll try to explain. It simply wouldn't work. You installed everything you needed to install, checked the system requirements, and it wouldn't work. Like me, hundreds of others. I was angry. Furious. So much so that, when I didn't know what to do, I decided to download this game to see if it would work. Today it worked; I don't know why, I don't know how, but it worked. The manufacturer's support for technical problems can be described with one word: ""nonexistent."" But let's move on. When I was little in 1994, there was Sim Tower, published by Maxis, where you built a skyscraper and had to manage it, deciding, floor by floor, what purpose it would serve: hospital, apartments, offices, shops, etc., and it was a very cute and fun game. Today there's Skyscraper Simulator, which has absolutely nothing to do with the first one, except for the skyscraper setting. Here you're not simulating a skyscraper, despite the title suggesting that, but you're a skyscraper builder. You build them, sell them, and rent them. Pay attention to the cost; it has to be right—not too high, or you'll run out of customers, nor too low, or you'll lose money. You'll have to keep an eye on construction costs, otherwise you could end up in the red, and that's trouble. It sounds fun, after all, I'm a fan of the tycoon genre, so what's the problem?
The problem is that it sucks. Not only do you risk spending money on a game that won't launch for no good reason, but if it does launch, you'll also find it boring. Bad. Poor. I don't recommend it. This isn't a B-game, but we've gone much lower; it's a B-game. I don't recommend it to anyone, but rather, I recommend it to whoever produced it, so they can see what crap they're selling."

Im nächsten Schritt sucht man sich ein Grundstück aus und anschließend kann man in einem kleinem Einstellungsfenster auswählen, was man bauen möchte: Wolkenkratzergröße, Büro oder Wohnen (bzw. Den Anteil), die Qualität der Räumlichkeiten. Auf das Aussehen oder die Form des Wolkenkratzers kann man keinen Einfluss nehmen. 

Als nächstes befindet man sich auf der Baustelle. Man muß nun Fahrzeuge kaufen und Leute einstellen und dann diese Leute ihren Arbeitsplätzen zuweisen. Dies geht ganz einfach über einen Schieberegler. Also z.B. ""10 Arbeiter benötigt"" und dann den Regler auf Maximum=10 Arbeiter eingeteilt. 

Nun schaut man die nächsten 5-10 Minuten zu, wie ein Bagger eine große Baugrube aushebt. Zum Glück gibts eine Zeitrafferfunktion. Ist das abgeschlossen, muß man Betonmischer kaufen und wieder Leite einteilen. Nun wird das Fundament gegossen. Das heißt, eigentlich ist das Fundament sofort da, nur die Grube (die Acht mal größer als das Fundament ist) wird quasi wieder angehoben. Das sind dann dich nächsten 5-10 Minuten im Zeitraffer. 
Ist diese Phase abgeschlossen kauft man zwei Transporter und zwei Kräne und teile die Kräne den Betonbauern und den anderen den Gerüstbauern zu. Und dann schaut man die nächsten 10-15 Minuten zu, wie der Wolkenkratzer langsam wächst. Dabei gibt es nicht wirklich irgendeine Bauphase zu sehen. Es ""wächst"" lediglich das 3D Modell und dann zieht die Außentextur drüber. Also wird der Wolkenkratzer eher ""aufgepumpt"", als wirklich gebaut.. 
Die Fahrzeuge bewegen sich dabei immer an die selbe Stelle. Sie kommen auf Die Baustelle, bleiben 30m vom Gerüst stehen und fahren dann wieder weg. Warentransport? Fehlanzeige.. Leute auf der Baustelle? Ja.. 200 Leute eingestellt.. zu sehen ist aber keiner. 
Auch das Bild der Baustelle selbst ändert sich nicht. Also das z.B. Wohncontainer oder sowas mit der Zahl der Arbeiter wächst. Nicht mal in den Fahrzeugen sind Arbeiter!!!
Auch die Animationen (zumindestens bei den Baggern, die das einzige sind, die sich bewegen) sind hässlich. Die Fahrzeuge bewegen sich nicht vorwärts, sondern ""hoppeln"" von einer Fixposition zur nächsten. Auch die Reifen drehen sich nicht (müssen sie ja auch nicht, weil die Fahrzeuge ja nicht fahren, sondern eher teleportieren). 

Wenn das Gebäude dann fertig ist, bekommt man ein Fenster angezeigt, wie lange man gebraucht hat, was es gekostet hat. Dabei werden auch alle gekauften Fahrzeuge verkauft und man kann das nächste Gelände bebauen.. Natürlich wieder alles neu kaufen. Ist doch klar, oder?

Also so eine Stronzdoofe ""Simulation"" habe ich ja schon lange nicht mehr erlebt. Mehr ein aktiver Bildschirmschoner, wobei ein Bildschirmschoner vermutlich noch interessanter ist. Dieses hier hat überhaupt nichts. Keine Wirtschaftsseite, kein Realismus, kein Spielspass.. Überhaupt nichts.. Ich weiß auch nicht, welche Zielgruppe dieses Teil ansprechen soll. 
Dazu muß ich sagen, das ich durchaus Simulationen eine Chance gebe, auch die auf den ersten Blick ""seltsam"" erscheinen (selbst der Gabelstapler-Simulator macht mehr Spaß als dies hier!). 

Ich kann nur empfehlen die Finger von dem Ding hier zu lassen. Wer Wolkenkratzer bauen möchte, sollte sich lieber ""Tycoon City New York"" holen. Das ist zwar schon etwas älter, macht aber bedeutend mehr Spaß (und sieht vermutlich auch noch besser aus).","The title screen features a ""pretty"" Google Earth view of New York. Okay, it looks better in Google Earth, but whatever.

In the next step, you select a plot of land and then, in a small settings window, you can choose what you want to build: skyscraper size, office or residential space (or the proportion), and the quality of the spaces. You can't influence the appearance or shape of the skyscraper.

Next, you're at the construction site. You have to buy vehicles and hire people, and then assign these people to their workstations. This is easily done using a slider. For example, select ""10 workers needed"" and then set the slider to maximum = 10 workers.


Now, for the next 5-10 minutes, you watch as an excavator digs a large foundation pit. Fortunately, there's a time-lapse function. Once that's finished, you have to buy concrete mixers and assign more workers. Now the foundation is poured. This means that the foundation is actually there immediately, only the pit (which is eight times larger than the foundation) is essentially raised again. That's the next 5-10 minutes in fast motion.
Once this phase is complete, you buy two vans and two cranes and assign one crane to the concrete workers and the other to the scaffolders. And then you watch for the next 10-15 minutes as the skyscraper slowly grows. There isn't really any construction phase to be seen. It's just the 3D model that ""grows"" and then the exterior texture is drawn over it. So the skyscraper is more ""inflated"" than actually built.
The vehicles always move to the same spot. They arrive at the construction site, stop 30 meters from the scaffolding, and then drive away again. Transporting goods? None. People on the construction site? Yes. 200 people hired. But no one can be seen.
The image of the construction site itself doesn't change either. So, for example, residential containers or something similar grow with the number of workers. There aren't even workers in the vehicles!!!
The animations (at least with the excavators, which are the only ones that move) are ugly. The vehicles don't move forward, but rather ""hop"" from one fixed position to the next. The tires don't rotate either (they don't have to, because the vehicles don't drive, but rather teleport).

When the building is finished, you get a window showing how long it took and what it cost. All purchased vehicles are also sold, and you can build on the next site... Of course, you have to buy everything again. That's obvious, right?

I haven't seen such a stupid ""simulation"" in a long time. More like an active screensaver, although a screensaver is probably even more interesting. This one has nothing at all. No economics, no realism, no fun... Nothing at all... I don't even know which target audience this thing is supposed to appeal to.

I have to say that I'll definitely give simulations a chance, even those that seem ""odd"" at first glance (even the Forklift Simulator is more fun than this one!).

I can only recommend staying away from this thing. If you want to build skyscrapers, you should get ""Tycoon City New York"" instead. It's a bit older, but significantly more fun (and probably looks better too)."

The vehicles have super weird randomly generated names like ""Doleful Elizabeth"" or ""Freaky Dylan"". Bewildering. Then you hire some employees. Some of them might take weeks to turn up, whilst your digger is sitting there doing nothing. Great. Eventually they turn up. Now you can dig a hole. You can let the game do this, I advise that you do exactly that. Wait, I advise that you do not even try and get this far.

Initially, I thought I could have input into the skyscraper's design; fiddle with floorplans and construction methods and so forth. What I got was 3 arbitrary choices for sky scraper design and 4 slider bars to tweak quality/quantity/type of rooms in the building, and the number of floors. That's it. 

At this point I thought 'oh well, maybe they make up for this with complex and engaging mechanics in management of the actual construction. I could dig that.' What I expected now was a game with plenty of 'make sure this resource is managed well' and 'hire/fire staff as needed', but also a game with slightly complex decisions like choosing companies to contract with, or buying resource sources. Also random events, and a solid progression as described of 'start with multistory houses, and work up to mega skyscrapers'. What I got was a game of 'hire/fire people as needed. that's it.'

By the time I finished the tutorial/learning process (completed one skyscraper), I decided I'd build another. I maxed the speed the whole time, and found myself entirely and utterly bored. This isn't really a game so much as an add-on for some other, non-existant game with the other 90% of the process. I am generally not critical of games, but this game is only worth a dollar or two as it stands. These simulator games seem to be turning out to be a money grab, rather than a genuine simulator.

In case you didn't understand, lemme repeat: DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!! STAY THE F*_*CK AWAY FROM IT!!!

This was one of the first games I bought on Steam and, boy, what a way to start.

The first thing that struck me was the bland and undetailed graphics that just made my eyes share some tears for how bad they looked. I'm not the kind of guy that judges a game by it's graphics. But, damn! The graphics of this game sucks right across the board! The world overview is just a Google Maps image used as a texture and slapt over a overly simplified 3D ""model"" of a ""city"". Do I need to go further on how the graphics on this game sucks? In case I do, lemme tell you that you have only TWO models of skyscrapers to choose from and, as you might expect, they look like HORRIBLE. And when I say HORRIBLE, I REALLY mean it.

The gameplay is so bland, so poor, so repetitive and counfusing that I actually felt sad experiencing it. You will spend maybe five to ten minutes micromanaging stuff to get your skyscraper done and that's it. Your skyscraper will be finished and you'll not feel a single dent of accomplishment for it. You will, in fact, feel sad for having wasted your life with such a poor and boring excuse of a game. Wasn't it enough, there is a bug in the game that will start playing thousands of samples at the same time making a hell of a noise, just like a freaking stun grenade, and, if this bug don't blow your eardrums instantly, will definitelly leave your ears ringing for a while. Sound fun, eh?! 

This game is an offence to anyone who bought it. And the best part is that the developers just don't give a flying f:3ck about it being bad; they just don't bother paying attention to the feedback given by the costumers to improve it. Well, if the developers made this ""tvrd"" (that's latin for sh*t) of a game only to make some quick buck and not improve it any further, I say FUCK the developers and FUCK this game.

Looked very Promising for a Simulator. I started up the game and went to playing.

This game is a lying Scumbag and does not make a Great gift for anyone....
Unless you're a Troll.
A Unity Flash Game has better Textures than this!
It looks like the BG Was done with Google Maps, and it was.
Also, half of the features in the Game are not there. YOU SHOULD AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS!","One day, I stumbled upon this game in a Steam Sale (God Damn sales)

Fails to deliver what is promised in the game description. The only ""feature"" they promised and delivered was the intuitive control. The navigation is pretty much the default for 3d software.

Incomplete. Not a work in progress. Not an early access. It's simply a pre-alpha quality release being sold as a final product. Typos, bugs, endless crashes. Not Steam quality standard. 

You can hire extra engineers, but can't get them to do anything. The development was aborted before that. You have a tooltip they call a tutorial on description. But it explains what they planned to develop, not what they actually did. You can sell your skyscraper. And sometimes you'll be able to buy it back for the original land value... and sell again for the skyscraper value... and repeat... If for some reason the game sells you two vehicles with the same name, your save file is wasted. the game will crash when you try to sell or move the vehicle or when the building process is over.

For ages 6 and below. Not challenging. One of the only simulator games where anyone that can read will probably get everything right since the first attempt. If you sell your buildings, you'll get rich. If you rent them out, you'll get rich. You can just set the price to maximum and ensure maximum profits. Nothing to calculate, no need for operations research. Any building will sell for maximum price within one year. And you can't build a new one faster than that anyway... no need to hurry then. If you set the rent out price to the maximum, you'll get the maximum sale value every 4 years. You'll start slower, but will build up steady income faster (exponential income growth). You can use your steady income to ensure you won't run out of money when investing more than you have.

As a matter of fact, your only job is to allocate workforce and machinery. Too bad that's about half a thousandth of the skyscraper building costs. In other words, you can fail pathetically and will still look successful.

For some reason, you can rent out your skyscraper as soon as it's about 20% done constructing (60% total building time). That means you only need money enough for 60% of the building process. From that point on, the rent will give you more than you can possibly spend on its construction.

No maps or modding. No scripting to fix their bugs. Simulators really need modding capabilities. Especially if the developers decide not to finish the game before (or after) selling.

Only worth buying if it has a 98% off discount. The only two challenges in the game are:
1 - Play for one hour without quitting out of boredom or having the game crash.
2 - Try to have fun playing this. Your role is irrelevant. There is no real challenge.
3 - Go bankrupt without intentionally cutting all your revenue streams.

TL;DR: the official game screenshots will bring you more challenge and fun than the actual game. They've worked harder on them than the development.","""0.2/10"" According to My Own Rating.
