This port is pretty broken and doesn't seem to work without a lot of fixes, so personally if you're fine with tweaking your pc games I say go for it and pick this up when it's cheap. MSRP being 40$ this game isn't worth it, and Konami should adjust a lot of their backlogs of games in general to better reflect the games quality and age.

This isn't a terrible silent hill game but it is not the best, that would go to that horrible book of memories vita exclusive game (horrible dungeon crawler) or even perhaps shattered memories (good ambience and puzzles, but awful gameplay in the action segments.)

Combat is kinda bunk but not too awful, but the game shines mostly for it's story, enemies, and areas. In SH: Homecoming you explore that upper right area of Silent Hill, right above the town center itself, Shepherds Glen.
You go into the game as Alex searching for his brother and come across a lot of interesting characters going through their own crazy shit. Each otherworld area feels like you're intruding into someone elses nightmare, and it's pretty entertaining, and thankfully mostly everybody here is awake and seeing what you're seeing, which I don't think has been a huge thing in past Silent Hill games. SH2 had characters going through similar areas but everyone saw their surroundings and monsters completely differently.

Anyway, my memory is still a bit foggy about this game but at least it's not awful, and it is fully playable and on PC give or take. I wish more Silent Hill games were available on Steam. Like I said it's not terrible but it's definitely not SH: 1-4 in terms of quality. I would honestly recommend getting SH4: The Room off of GoG as that is my favorite SH and actually most accessible on PC (working right out of the box) besides the newest remake of SH2.","I've previously played through this when it came out and a little bit a few years back.

203811535,brazilian,2025.08.07 20:58,✅,❌,0.5652173758,3,"Na minha opinião, este é o Silent Hill mais fraco da linha principal. Diferente dos outros jogos da franquia, em que cada criatura tem um motivo e há uma construção sólida dos eventos até o protagonista chegar a ""Silent Hill"", aqui tudo parece apenas jogado, como uma mistura dos antecessores sem muito aprofundamento e não se passa exatamente em Silent Hill.

Na história, acompanhamos Alex Shepherd, que acorda em um hospital amarrado. Ele tem um péssimo pressentimento sobre seu irmão e parte para Shepherd’s Glen, uma cidade vizinha a Silent Hill, próxima ao lago Toluca. Lá, descobre que seu irmão e seu pai desapareceram, a cidade está estranhamente vazia, sua mãe se comporta de forma esquisita e eventos misteriosos envolvendo o culto da região começam a surgir.

O problema do jogo não é nem a época em que foi lançado, mas sim o roteiro mal escrito, que resulta em uma história arrastada e chata. O que salva são alguns aspectos da imersão (mesmo não sendo exatamente em Silent Hill, o que é outro ponto negativo), que dão aquela vontade de explorar e reforçam a sensação de sobrevivência. Ao jogar, tive a impressão de que o desenvolvimento foi conturbado e pesquisando depois, vi que realmente foi kk.

Ainda assim, pode valer a pena pegá-lo em uma promoção, por uns 5 reais, já que há alguns elementos interessantes, mesmo com todos os defeitos mencionados.",
203747142,brazilian,2025.08.07 05:00,✅,✅,0.5,0,"Tenho pouco tempo de gameplay mas já zerei a campanha fora da Steam. Vou recomendar este jogo da mesma forma que a Chiquinha elogia o Seu Madruga.

Sim, o port é zoado, tem que baixar mod externo para ficar jogável, os controles são esquisitos, o áudio é bugado, e tem as falhas técnicas típicas um jogo de quase duas décadas de idade. Não recebe e nem receberá atualizações visto que a empresa que desenvolveu o jogo deixou de existir há uma década.

Curiosamente, mesmo com tudo isso, se você conseguir fazer o jogo rodar, e encarar sem muito compromisso, o jogo até consegue ser uma experiência divertida. Virou meio que uma guilty pleasure para mim, o jogo é de fato meio cagado em muitos pontos, mas não é tedioso e nem ""injogável"" como costuma ocorrer com jogos antigos que não são bem adaptados para PC.

Recomendo apenas para quem já está acostumado com jogos ""antigos"" e já está habituado com jogos do gênero, e para quem tem paciência para buscar soluções para os bugs e falhas que podem vir a aparecer. Em desconto fica um preço mais barato que uma coxinha.

A Silent Hill: Homecoming egy olyan rész, ami sok vitát kavart a rajongók között, de ha adsz neki esélyt, baromi erős élményt ad – főleg, ha szereted a nyomasztó atmoszférát és a klasszikus Silent Hill-hangulatot.

Atmoszféra és környezet

A játék legerősebb pontja egyértelműen az atmoszféra. Shepherd's Glen és Silent Hill városa elképesztően jól meg lett csinálva: az elhagyatott utcák, a rozsdás fém ajtók, a halk gépek zúgása és az őrjítő köd egyszerűen beszippantja az embert. A város él és lélegzik a maga beteg módján. Minden egyes helyszín olyan, mintha el akarja mondani a saját történetét – még a legkisebb, elhagyott szobákban is találsz valami nyugtalanító részletet.

Soundtrack és hangulat

A zenék és a hangok itt brutálisan erősek. Akira Yamaoka ismét odatette magát, és a dallamok egyszerre gyönyörűek és rémisztőek. Vannak részek, ahol csak egy halk, fémes nyikorgás vagy gépzúgás van, máshol meg olyan dallam, amitől futkos a hideg a hátadon. Ez a soundtrack konkrétan fél játékot elvisz a hátán, és a Silent Hill-sorozat egyik legerősebb eleme itt is megmaradt.

Történet és karakterek

A sztori egy kicsit más, mint a korábbi részekben, mert most Alex Shepherd történetét követjük, aki katona volt, és visszatér a szülővárosába, hogy megtalálja az eltűnt öccsét, Josh-t. Ahogy haladsz előre, egyre több sötét titok derül ki a családjáról és a város múltjáról.
A sztori végig nyomasztó, és nagyon sok benne a pszichológiai elem, ami miatt a játék igazán Silent Hill marad. A végső csavar és a befejezések tipikusan sorozathűek – többféle ending is van, köztük olyan, ami konkrétan letépi az agyad.

Szörnyek és harc

A szörnyek designja beteg és kreatív, hozza a sorozat groteszk stílusát. Pyramid Head is feltűnik, ami hatalmas plusz a lore-fanoknak.
A harcrendszer itt kicsit akció-orientáltabb lett, mint a korábbi részekben, ami megosztó lehet, de szerintem nem rontja el az élményt – sőt, ad egy kis feszült, taktikus elemet, mert nem vagy teljesen tehetetlen, de még így is félned kell a találkozásoktól.

Grafika és dizájn

A korához képest nagyon rendben van. A sötét színek, a köd, az Otherworld átváltásai rohadtul nyomasztóak, és amikor a világ hirtelen szétesik és átfordul rozsdás pokollá, az az egyik legerősebb horror-jelenet, amit játékban láttam.

Összegzés

A Silent Hill: Homecoming nem hibátlan (van, akinek az irányítás és az akció túl sok), de ha szereted a pszichológiai horrort, a beteg városdizájnt és a brutális atmoszférát, akkor ez egy kötelező darab. A sztori, a város és a soundtrack együtt olyan élményt adnak, amit nagyon kevés horrorjáték tud megközelíteni.

 Pozitívumok:
✔ Zseniális soundtrack (Akira Yamaoka top formában)
✔ Nagyon erős atmoszféra és helyszíndizájn
✔ Sötét, beteg sztori több befejezéssel
✔ Klasszikus Silent Hill-hangulat modern köntösben

✘ Negatívumok:
– Kissé akciódúsabb a korábbiaknál (nem mindenkinek jön be)
– Irányítás és kamera néha fura
– Pár bug és technikai hiba (főleg PC-n)

Ha szereted a horrorjátékokat és Silent Hill világát, ne hagyd ki!",

Lo comento, porque para poder disfrutar de este port sin problemas es todo una travesía,  estuve a punto de pedir mi reembolso, pero la verdad tenía muchas ganas de disfrutar de la historia. Lo primero, cuando lo instale y comencé a jugar el primer problema con el que me encontré es que los fps estaban lockeados a 30 a pesar de que en el propio juego venga la opción de elevar la cantidad de fps hasta 240, no funciona; bueno, acepté el hecho de tener que jugarlo a 30 cuadros por segundo, pero el segundo problema con el que me tope y definitivamente no pude seguir jugandolo así, fueron los crasheos constantes sobre todo en las pantallas de carga y fue muy frustrante porque el juego no tiene sistema de autoguardado y los check points pueden estar de un extremo a otro, hablo de 40 minutos de gameplay entre uno y otro y por un crasheo lo pierdes todo X.x. Este juego empezó a poner a prueba mi cordura, para colmo el tercer problema fue el audio, por alguna razon el juego cuando se juega con audifonos esta mal configurado, no tienes esa sensación espacial de los sonidos, mas bien es como si todos los efectos del juego se escucharan de un lado y la ambientación musical del otro. 
Bueno, las soluciones, como siempre es la comunidad de modders son los que tiene que arreglar las cagadas que hacen las empresas multimillonarias, existe un buen hombre que hizo un parche que arregla el juego, el problema es que como este port lleva años que se lanzo hay varias paginas que se hacen pasar por la pagina oficial del buen hombre y comparten parches con malware y software maliciosos, me tope con 3 parches que decian ser los oficiales y al pasar por el analisis de antivirus detectaba 7 tipos de troyanos distintos XD. Hay que ser muy cuidadoso de donde se descarga, la persona que creo el parche tiene su pagina oficial y su pagina de github su nombre es unknownproject. El arregla todos los problemas del juego, fue gracias a él que no reembolse el juego y estoy aquí haciendo mi reseña. 
Vamos con el juego en cuestión:
Historia y Narrativa
La historia por mucho que intentes prestarle atención no llega a ninguna conclusión absoluta, hay muchos huecos argumentales que no se resuelven ni se esperan resolver ni siquiera los propios desarrolladores dieron una conclusión oficial en su momento. Todo lo dejan a ""interpretación de cada usuario"" lo cual me parece una excusa tosca para decir que la historia intenta ser misteriosa y generar incertidumbre, pero al final no puedes atar todos los cabos de los eventos que ocurren y que todos tengan sentido. 
Jugabilidad y Mecánicas
Respecto al combate, es algo lento y táctico, definitivamente me gusta la idea de pensar los movimientos que vas a hacer cuando te enfrentas a las entidades, pero la ejecución no es tan prometedora, los movimientos se sienten poco responsivos y hay veces en que las hitbox y alcance de los ataques no coinciden, lo cual genera mucha frustración si lo juegas en la máxima dificultad, porque sí este juego es dificíl. No tengo más que decir, el juego se resumen en moverte por el mapa, pelear cada 2 por 3 de camino de un punto a otro y luego ir sabiendo cada vez más de la historia y conociendo a los personajes en los que se desarrolla.
Gráficos y Diseño
Los gráficos para la época no están mal, de hecho algo que me llamo la atención es que aquí hay reflejos en los espejos y superficies sin necesidad del famoso trazado de rayos de los juegos actuales XD. Me recordó que no es necesrio tener todas esas tecnologías para tener reflejos aceptables en los juegos. El diseño de los niveles el algo plano, pero es un pueblo casi abandonado, no puedo esperar mucho de ello. El apartado visual de los enemigos principales esta bien logrados, es crudo y tétrico tal como se espera de un survival horror, así que por ese lado esta muy bien.
 Apartado Sonoro
Fuera de los detalles que se tienen al inicio con los sonidos, el apartado sonoro no me hizo sentir la vibra que me han hecho sentir otros juegos del género survival horror como el evilwithin, creo que esta más apuntado hacía la tristeza que genera la historia, pero no hay nada más que agregar.
Rendimiento y Optimización
No hay ni habrá optimización para este juego, ya es muy viejo y Konami lo tiene bien arrumbado en su estanteria de juegos que no volvera a tocar. No me queda más que agradecer a unknownproject por darle la oportunidad a mí y a otros jugadores de disfrutar este título a pesar de la basura de port oficial que esta en la plataforma.
Veredicto Final
Yo no recomiendo este juego por todos los problemas que tiene la versión oficial y por no presentar algo concreto en su historia. 
P.D.: Sé que steam registra mis horas jugadas del juego y que parece que no lo jugué, pero eso es porque tuve que jugarlo directamente del ejecutor que hay en las carpetas locales del juego para evitar crasheos. Excelente día a todos gamers.",

  A história em si tem coisas boas como em qualquer Silent Hill, a parte da qual você retorna à casa do protagonista (""Alex Shepherd"") em Silent Hill, dele tentando entender o fato de ser assombrado pelo seu irmão mais novo Joshua, e de ao chegar na cidade e em sua casa, entender também o mistério em torno do pai, que parece ter desaparecido com metade das pessoas de Silent Hill junto com também seu irmão, onde todo mundo na região parece saber de algum segredo da qual você não sabe por ter sido afastado e servido o exército por tanto tempo, mas algo que chama atenção é não ter fotos suas nos quadros da casa para agregar na curiosidade ao espectador, mas o protagonista e os demais personagens dessa história são muito inferiores aos da trilogia clássica, com algumas expressões faciais e cutscenes bem zoadinhas até mesmo para um jogo de 2008, que o personagem que sofre mais com isso é a da prefeita da cidade, a ""Juíza Holloway"", que meu Deus sempre que ela aparecia e fazia suas expressões perto do final do jogo era um terror por si só. Além disso, me incomoda também o fato da história sempre tentar a todo tempo ressaltar que está em Silent Hill, que sem brincadeira são umas três cenas distantes uma das outras, que os personagens falam que irão para ""Silent Hill"" de verdade, sendo que já estão desde que passa a primeira parte no hospital do game.

  Bem, como de costume, esse parágrafo é para abordar a trama com liberdade de alguns spoilers, que caso você não queira saber, pule para o próximo parágrafo, que aviso dado, lá vai. Chega a ser decepcionante uma história com tanto potencial para um desenvolvimento tão fraco, que o protagonista da vez, o tal ""Alex"" e a relação dele com seu irmão mais novo, de fato te chama a atenção, com esse lance dele não ser militar no fim das contas, e sim algo que ele criou na sua mente após um estresse pós-traumático de ter acidentalmente causado a morte de seu irmão mais novo naquela cena final no barco deles brigando para pegar o ""colar"" e o ""Joshua"" tendo quebrado o pescoço na queda ao ter arrebentado o cordão. Além dessa parte, a história se aprofunda ainda mais na questão da ""Ordem"", ou melhor, da seita satânica dessa cidade, ser ligado entre o rapaz lá que conserta armas, a juíza e o pai do protagonista, tendo uma aliança forçada pela juíza para conseguir alimentar o tal demônio que crêem ser ""deus"" para não matarem suas familias completamente, com o sacrífico de um de seus filhos, onde o pai do ""Alex"" e do ""Joshua"", tinha escolhido o ""Alex"" para ser esse ""cordeiro"", mas mesmo com as precauções de amor e afeto nesse seu filho que seria o ""cordeiro"", não conseguiu fazer pelo ""destino"" (ou certamente a cidade) ter escolhido o ""Joshua"" no acidente do barco, que com essa revelação, vem mais um confronto com um monstro bizarro que remete a uma mulher grávida, e que logo após, fecha com uma cena que desesmotiva toda a experiência até aqui, do Alex sendo torturado no hospital, e aparentemente ter sido talvez algo da mente do protagonista por todo esse tempo. Tem alguns outros finais no jogo, mas esse que peguei, apesar de fechar bem, a cena no hospital me levantou essa dúvida de ser algo da mente dele, fechando meio mal toda uma experiência que já foi sofrida pela otimização e pela gameplay tão fraca quanto.

  E sobre o ponto mais problemático, que é a gameplay, o jogo até tenta acertar ao finalmente focar na visão em terceira pessoa sem qualquer câmera fixa, que ajuda e muito principalmente a visibilidade nos inimigos em ver onde estão e tudo, mas aí trazem esse modo de batalha ao segurar o Shift que tem uma vibe de jogo mobile mal montado, como se usassem templates prontos da internet de animações e de todo o combate, e isso se escancara ainda mais com a movimentação zoada do protagonista, além de um sistema de escolha de diálogos que sinceramente não sei pra que tem se não se aprofunda nisso tendo apenas uma vez ou outra com um diálogo que muda algo que seja, mas que não faz diferença prática nenhuma no rumo da história, fora os inúmeros problemas técnicos que vão desde frame drops absurdos como dito antes, travamentos constantes, e até um áudio completamente bugado nessa versão da Steam que alterna de um lado pro outro sem sentido nenhum, e nem dá para pular as cutscenes, mesmo tendo morrido para algum chefão do jogo, o que só piora e muito a experiência quando precisa repetir alguma parte, e pra completar ainda tem esse detalhe nas configurações onde mesmo botando em 60HZ ou mais, o jogo continua travado em 30 FPS como se a opção fosse só um placebo, e é triste porque apesar disso tudo, a trilha sonora continua maravilhosa, digna da franquia, e os chefões são visualmente incríveis com estética e com o conceito puro de Silent Hill, mas acabam desperdiçados num jogo que não consegue sustentar esse peso, com um protagonista bem artificial que os anteriores e que entrega uma experiência que podia ser algo pelo menos decente, e não tão fraco como é. Ah, e caso você seja maluco igual eu fui, e queira enfrentar esse jogo por alguma razão pessoal sua, as dicas que dou é de novamente estocar munição sempre que puder para os chefões, e de não colocar nas configurações do jogo, a resolução acima de ""1440x900"", que se fizer isso, tudo ficará preto e não funcionará, mas tem um leve macete, de mudar manualmente, dentro da pasta interna do jogo apenas editando o arquivo ""vars_pc.cfg"" com um bloco de nota, e colocando na parte de ""ScreenResHeight"", o número 1080 no lugar do que estiver lá, e ""ScreenResWidth"", o numero 1920, que só assim que ele funciona em FULL HD, em vez de ficar tudo preto, se colocasse nas opções do jogo. Com relação ao FPS, eu ate tentei aumentar para 60 do mesmo jeito dentro desse documento, mas não funciona de forma alguma, e sinceramente, eu não conselho que tentem ir fundo nisso, porque se o jogo já é problemático com esse travamento de FPS para tentar estabilizar, imagina sem. 

No todo, é um jogo bem chatinho da franquia, sem muita alma e que me parece muito um jogo de celular, de tão genérico e meio zoado que ele é, que não chega a ser o pior jogo que já joguei ou algo assim, por ter alguns pontos positivos como sua trilha sonora ainda ser excelente, e o visual dos chefões e dos monstros serem bem legais, mantendo uma gameplay que mesmo sendo ruimzinha dá para jogar, que tem que se esforçar um pouco para zerá-lo com tantos crashes e problemas de otimização nessa versão da Steam que joguei. O que me entristece é o potencial nesse, que é o mais intuitivo de jogar que os outros da trilogia original, sem se perder tanto no que é para fazer, mas de que adianta, com uma história meio bagunçada, e um sistema de combate tão fraco quanto os outros, que antes o que carregava era de fato a trama que era um primor, e esse nem isso tem muito para valer tamanho sofrimento, apesar de ter seus momentos legais, mas esquecível e fraco a um ponto de na próxima semana você não lembrar mais de nada dele, infelizmente.",

Y es que haber, por el lado musical cumple, dado que sí, Akira Yamaoka, el compositor de toda la vida en la saga Silent Hill estuvo presente, así que por esa parte el juego posee una muy buena atmósfera, más unos temazos que dan la talla de sobra.
Por la parte de la estética visual, esta es algo… cutre, queda a deber incluso para la época que salió, aunque supongo que “funciona” a su modo.
(Y ya es todo lo positivo que puedo decir)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Ahora para pasar a la siguiente sección, debo decir que he probado la experiencia de dos modos, la primera: tal cual la descarga directa desde Steam, y la segunda: con los parches de la comunidad. 

Y en ambos casos, (y con el perdón de la comunidad que bien intencionada aportó en lo posible en arreglar algo defectuoso desde su núcleo) no queda otra que decir: 
“Silent Hill Homecoming es LAMENTABLE”. 

Un juego malamente acabado con varios bugs, una interfaz horrible, mapas espantosos que parecen recortes de Paint además de mal encuadrados, efectos de sonido que tienen un paneo extraño (mi oreja derecha creo que ahora escucha en otra dimensión a 64kbps), un sistema de combate que se queda a medias (y que de verdad me pareció que iba a defenderse por sí solo, eso claro, fue solo la impresión en los primeros momentos, luego un fiasco).
Esta entrega de verdad que tiene MUCHOS ERRORES TÉCNICOS, errores ligados tanto a jugabilidad, sistema, carga, menús, configuraciones y hasta crasheos de la nada (o peor, que se te atore el PC y tengas que reiniciar todo).

Recalco, abordé este Silent Hill con una mente abierta (además de algunas experiencias previas en otras plataformas) junto con el conocimiento general donde se sabe que esta es de las entregas que más disgustó a la comunidad, y pese a ello las primeras horas me resultaron aceptables, que va, hasta algo atrapantes, pero luego de sufrir tantos errores y ver las costuras en un producto de muy baja calidad, hace difícil defender algo así.

	That being said, I despise this video game. For me 'Silent Hill: Homecoming' fundamentally misunderstands everything that made the original Silent Hill special while spitting on the face of Silent Hill 2 and the direction that it tried to take the franchise. 

	For me, this is not a Silent Hill game. It lacks the skeleton of the gameplay, the atmosphere and quality of the originals' level design, and the well crafted story and themes of the classics (not to say how less subtle everything is, I swear Alex broke my immersion by how much on your face his dialogues are when inspecting his house). Not everything in this game sucks, I would argue that sometimes it introduces a nice element or theme to the narrative, and levels like the Otherworld version of the Shepherd House are pretty good actually. Some puzzles are okay, I guess, but I barely really had to do any mental effort for like 90% of the game.

	This doesn’t feel like a main entry in the franchise, but rather a tie-in game inspired by the movie (now that I think about it, this would explain the bad quality of the overall product). For me, every enemy design sucks and it’s purely there for shock value, this game has a fricking boss designed like the “Human Centipede”! They don’t fit in with the rest of the classic's roster of enemies and the bosses feel like they came from a different type of game altogether (like the doll boss that looks directly cut from a horror version of Dark Souls). 

	This game is also really raw and brutal in ways that take away the surrealist and otherworldly vibe of Silent Hill. It feels like it took more inspiration from Saw or Hostel than from Silent Hill, which leaves a bad taste in my mouth everytime I see it. Also, most NPCs' feels so forced to the point of even ruining the actual good ones. The highlights for me were the moments with your parents and Deputy Wheeler (the absolute GOAT).

	In the end, I hate this game and think it’s a miserable experience that goes against everything that made me love Silent Hill. The steam port is also an absolute broken mess, but my experience playing on the PS3 was pretty buggy as well… the only difference is that it was just playable and beatable, the same almost can’t be said for the steam version.

La historia es bastante sencilla, aunque tiene algún que otro agujerito de guión bastante curioso, si nos ponemos a pensar en ello.
La dificultad normal es mentira, es díficil camuflado de narices pero encima con los bugs que tiene a veces ni los mods por fans te ayudan mucho, he tenido que repetir mapas por que el juego a veces decide si me ha dado el enemigo o no cómo le guste, pero aún así, a mi, me ha gustado, más para liberar bastante mala hostia encima.

We miss a lot of the nuances and mystery of what makes Silent Hill what it is. Endings are tied to a mere few and fairly obvious choices. There is very limited exploration in each location which are all pretty small and self-contained. It really lacks the mystery and feel of Silent Hill right down to a lack of identifiable music or sound design. Some of the story is pretty alright and does address some genuine conflicts a person may face, but it often feels a bit messy along with the fact that the endings are pretty abrupt. 

Possibly due to your military training the game features a bit more in-depth combat than previous entries. You can now combo melee attacks and even charge a heavy attack to better take down the horrors within the fog. This comes with an issue as many bosses and enemies almost seem to exclusively take damage from melee making guns often feel less useful. Even then, melee combos can  suddenly miss as the enemies seem to be get pushed out of the way by an invisible force before your final hit.  This is only more infuriating when you fight enemies that seem to block every hit without some specific timing and even then it is variable. We also get a dodge mechanic that is... not great. Often times the dodge will rarely be to your benefit or instead you'll just end up blocking which does even less for your positional advantage. In many cases it is better just to get out of stance and run than it is to dodge.

What turns a subpar game into a dumpster fire? Performance. This game does everything in it's power to try and stop you from playing. It will periodically freeze either randomly or during interactions for several seconds before either resuming or crashing. Even when just booting the game up it can just sometimes crash or not run all together. Using a controller, and even with binding keys, you'll very quickly find that the game not only displays the incorrect prompt in QTEs, but seems to be inconsistent on top of that. So, if you have to mash out of a potential death, either mash everything because it won't be the same button that is displayed or even the same button it was for the previous attempt OR switch to keyboard and mouse for those sections. Visual glitches tend to be less frequent but you can sometimes see your character phase through objects, missing lighting in textures like eyes, and even have cutscenes misaligned with audio.

What would have been a 4 or 5 out of 10 game is easily a 2/10 due to performance issues alone. Had these issues not been prominent this could have been a lukewarm recommend, but honestly just avoid at all costs.","What is already a subpar entry in the series is only further brought down by performance issues and what is generally just a terrible port.

It follows Alex Shepherd, a person returning to his strange hometown of Shepherd's Glen and through a series of events, he ends up in Silent Hill, uncovering the unsettling fact about his past. Homecoming plays out more like an extension of the movies rather than the video games. This cinematic approach is reflected in its tone and presentation. Dark settings and atmospheric score create a good sense of unease throughout the game. Enhanced mechanics compared to earlier titles make encounters more engaging, adding a dynamic element to the gameplay. However, it falls short in delivering the psychological horror that some people expect. The narrative, while compelling to some extent, lacks the depth of the first Silent Hills. The general design is worth noting also choices like overly dark lighting are better for creating a sense of tension, but some camera angles and movement controls can be awkward and may detract from the overall experience. Additionally, the PC version has various technical difficulties. Preferably, due to backward compatibility, the optimal version may be the one that runs on Xbox One. In conclusion: Silent Hill: Homecoming was released on September 30, 2008. It's not a new release; therefore, evaluating it through today's perspective or being overly critical may not be entirely fair. Despite its flaws, it remains a noteworthy and memorable horror title that attempted to modernize the franchise while retaining its ominous tone.","Silent Hill: Homecoming is a notable entry in the Silent Hill series.

195011049,latam,2025.04.16 19:06,✅,❌,0.6000000238,5,"Probé Silent Hill: Homecoming en la Steam Deck y la verdad me sorprendió para bien. No es el mejor Silent Hill, eso está claro, pero si te gusta el terror con buena ambientación, te puede enganchar.

El juego corre bastante bien en la Steam Deck, aunque hay que hacerle un par de ajustes antes de jugar cómodamente. Lo primero es que no tiene soporte completo para los controles de la consola, así que hay que descargar una configuración de control hecha por la comunidad desde el mismo menú de Steam. No toma más de un minuto y después de eso se juega sin problema, solo debes acostumbrarte a la distribución de botones.

Otra cosa que hay que tocar es la resolución. Al principio no se ve muy bien, pero si entras a las opciones del juego, la puedes subir y mejora bastante el aspecto gráfico. No es complicado y vale la pena hacerlo.

En cuanto al juego en sí, la historia está buena, aunque se nota que tiene un enfoque un poco más americano que las entregas clásicas. El combate es más dinámico, casi como si fuera más de acción que de terror, lo que puede gustarte o no, depende de lo que busques.

Pros:
°Se ve bastante bien en la Steam Deck con algunos ajustes.
°Corre fluido y sin fallos graves.
°Buena ambientación, enemigos raros y momentos tensos.
°La historia atrapa si le das una oportunidad.

Contras:
°Hay que descargar una configuración de control para que funcione bien.
°La resolución hay que ajustarla manualmente.
°El sistema de combate es más acción que survival horror, lo que puede no gustarle a todos.
°En algunas ocasiones cuando se tiene que seleccionar dialogo con algun personaje, no funcionan los botones y toda reiniciar el juego.

En resumen:
Si tienes una Steam Deck y te gusta esta saga, Silent Hill: Homecoming es totalmente jugable y se disfruta bastante. No es perfecto, pero para pasar un buen rato con algo de terror, cumple. Ideal para los que extrañan esa onda clásica de Silent Hill, aunque con un estilo un poco distinto. Comprenlo si lo ven en descuento, solo asi vale la pena.",

Je ne recommande pas cette version PC, il faut parfois quitter le jeux et relancer pour jouer de nouveau correctement.

Concernant le jeux en lui même, je me suis surpris à ne pas lâcher la manette. Alors oui ce n'est pas Silent Hill 2 mais il a de bonnes qualités comme la bande son, l'ambiance, le scénario, les personnages, les énigmes, le rythme et les monstres.

Les points noirs en dehors du portage nul, peut-être les combats parfois mais la majorité du temps j'ai apprécié, c'est dynamique. Sinon Pyramid Head aurait été ajouté pour faire du fan service, le créateur du monstre avait précisé qu'il n'avait rien à faire là, qu'il serait lié à James de Silent Hill 2. Personnellement cela ne m'a pas dérangé, Silent Hill est une ville tellement tordue et on voit un ancien tableau avec Pyramid Head dans la prison de Silent Hill 2.

Pour 2€ j'ai quand même tenté l'expérience avec les patchs mais la version la plus stable reste la version Xbox360 (720p 30fps par contre). À vous de voir :/

1. Simply no PC optimization for buttons. The button prompts are not mapped correctly. You don't know whether left click, or right click does the intended thing. Whenever you want to select something, hovering your mouse over the thing makes it barely highlightable and it glows for a hot second before it stops glowing. Then you move your mouse over to another thing and there's a fraction of a delay so you don't know if the other thing is done highlighting. Then you click and it might register for the other thing. Then when you're done, how do you get out? Click again? No. Escape? Maybe? Right click? Maybe? The game DOES NOT TELL YOU.

1a. BONUS: one clock puzzle was so badly optimized that if you click any hand, it'll start spinning like mad to a random time. The original intent was to click the hand, then a position to set the time. Now, you can't click the position. You click the hand, then it just spins randomly. I had to pull a controller out and then it barely worked. Not to mention this puzzle was already glitched out, so I had to check every single time in the first half of the clock just to progress. This tied with the prison wire puzzle were true low points puzzle wise.

2. There are crashes everywhere. Open a door. It may crash. Near a save point? It may crash. Too many enemies? Maybe it'll crash.

3. Atrocious load times. Getting into the game is... okay. But when you click the red circles to save... it may take up to 30 seconds just to get to the save slots. Then when you save, another 10 seconds. When you die and respawn, it could be up to another 30 seconds. Transitioning to another zone? 30 seconds.

4. The facial and motion capture animation was mediocre and the lip sync was just goddamn awful.

5. The sound would constantly go from one side to the other, than to both, then back to one channel. The volume would randomly fluctuate.

6. The freaking dodge button and some QTE events are broken. This is really important because some bosses REQUIRE dodging to even survive and with a dodge button that works 10% of the time some QTE events that become instant kills, it made the boss fights stressful ordeals.

7. Misunderstood iconography. Nurses? Pyramid Head? Guys. Wrong game. No thematic connection here.

Let's end with the positives.

1. Great atmosphere and music. Truly captured the feel of Silent Hill, with creepy effects, sounds, etc.

2. Enemies were unique and well designed, as well as the bosses. 

3. The characters and the backstories were pretty all right.

4. Most critically, the gameplay loop (check map, look for next area to progress) is still very addicting.

193369114,spanish,2025.03.23 02:05,❌,❌,0.6496549845,17,"Homecoming es la quinta entrega de la más que emblemática saga de terror psicológico Silent Hill, y fue lanzado en el año 2008 para las plataformas de PC, PS3 y Xbox 360. Es uno de los primeros Silent Hill que no fue desarrollado por el Team Silent, equipo creador de la saga y responsable de grandísimos juegos como el Silent Hill 2; siendo desarrollado en este caso por Double Helix Games. Como introducción, destacar que este título marca un giro hacia un enfoque más occidental y orientado a la acción, lo que desde el momento cero generó opiniones divididas entre los fanáticos de la serie y es una de las características negativas del juego.

En Homecoming, tomamos el control de Alex Shepherd, un exsoldado que regresa a su pueblo natal, Shepherd's Glen, solo para descubrir que su hermano ha desaparecido, que su familia está completamente catatónica y que el propio lugar está sumido en la más profunda oscuridad: niebla, monstruos, desapariciones de personas y todo tipo de situaciones grotescas. A medida que avanza la trama, Alex se ve envuelto en los oscuros secretos del pueblo y que tienen una profunda conexión con un pueblo cercano, Silent Hill. A través de ella, Alex descubrirá los secretos más profundos de su propia familia. Sobre la historia, mencionar que aunque presenta una trama decente con giros interesantes, carece de la profundidad emocional y el simbolismo presentes en entregas anteriores, como Silent Hill 2.​ Es decir, la historia es lo suficientemente entretenida como para jugar al juego, pero no termina de sentirse como un Silent Hill del todo. Lo peor, los múltiples finales, que no solo son muy cortos sino que son carentes de contenido. A mi parecer, es como si hubiesen dejado el juego ""a medias"" y lo hubiesen finalizado mal y con prisas.

En cuanto a las mecánicas de juego, destacar que en esta entrega seguirán los archiconocidos puzzles míticos de la saga que nos permitirán avanzar en la historia y que en ocasiones siguen siendo igual de complicados y bien planteados como en otras entregas de la saga. Es novedad en esta entrega un nuevo sistema de combate más dirigido a la acción, que aunque es un soplo de aire fresco a la saga, a veces es un poco ortopédico y no termina de funcionar correctamente. De la ambientación, decir que es una más que digna sucesión de los juegos anteriores, sigue teniendo esa atmósfera densa y opresiva, con unos escenarios oscuros, grotescos y de ""pesadilla"" que te meten dentro de la historia y te hacen vivir en ocasiones la historia como si fueses el propio protagonista del juego. Los cambios entre el mundo real y el alternativo están bien logrados, sumergiendo al jugador en un entorno cada vez más desquiciado y aterrador. En cuanto al diseño de personajes y de jefes finales, diría que es el punto fuerte del videojuego, con unos diseños muy bien trabajados y con ese simbolismo tan impactante, retorcido, oscuro y perturbador al que estamos acostumbrados los fieles seguidores de esta saga. Finalmente, sobre la banda sonora mencionar que es uno de los apartados fuertes del juego, ya que está formada por piezas excelentes (a como nos acostumbra la saga) que evocan melancolía y terror (y que conseguirán ponerte los pelos de punta en muchas ocasiones), compuestas por el grandísimo Akira Yamaoka. En cuanto a los gráficos, mencionar que para la época eran gráficos más que correctos, con buenos detalles del escenario y de los personajes.

En cuanto a la optimización en PC, esto es lo que mata este juego y una de las razones por las que no lo recomiendo para nada. Por defecto, viene limitado a 30fps y no se puede cambiar. Además, su optimización es horrible y no funciona bien ni teniendo un buen ordenador, siendo la única solución el acudir a parches creados por la comunidad. Además, está lleno de cuelgues y bugs que arruinan la experiencia jugable.

En conclusión, no recomendaría Silent Hill: Homecoming. Para comenzar, comparado con otros títulos como Silent Hill 2 y Silent Hill 3, Homecoming no alcanza ni de lejos el nivel de dichos juegos, y por las lagunas narrativas, el mal planteamiento de los finales y la calidad de sus predecesores lo hacen no terminar del todo de ser un ""buen"" Silent Hill. Aunque tiene buenas ideas, buenos elementos de la trama y buenos diseños de monstruos, ambientación o música, se siente como un juego incompleto, inconexo y en ocasiones hecho a ""lo rápido"". Eso, sumado a los graves errores de optimización y funcionamiento, hacen que sea un juego totalmente evitable.

La historia es mediocre, sin sentido. Se supone que Pyramid Head es una manifestación del remordimiento y deseo de castigo de James en Silent Hill 2 y te lo meten en este juego por puro fanservice. No sé quién creó esta ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pero quizás debería leerse primero de qué trata su propio juego. El sistema de combate es ridículo. Sí, el protagonista sabe pelear pero los monstruos te aguantan más golpes que Rocky Balboa. Es el resident evil 5 de los Silent Hill: Pura acción, nada de terror. Pero es que encima mal implementado.
La sensibilidad estaba bug, los botones estaban bug, hasta los guardados estaban bug. Debería ser ilegal que este juego esté a la venta.",

193160490,spanish,2025.03.20 09:19,✅,✅,0.5454545617,2,"Silent Hill: Homecoming es una entrega que divide opiniones dentro de la saga de terror psicológico. Por un lado, ofrece una historia intrigante sobre Alex Shepherd, un exsoldado que regresa a su ciudad natal y descubre oscuros secretos familiares y su conexión con Silent Hill. Además, el diseño de los monstruos y los entornos es visualmente impactante.

Sin embargo, algunos críticos mencionan que el juego pierde parte del elemento psicológico y emocional que caracteriza a la franquicia. También se han señalado problemas con los controles y el combate, que pueden sentirse repetitivos.
Si te gusta el género de survival horror y estás dispuesto a explorar una perspectiva diferente de Silent Hill, podría ser una experiencia interesante. Quizas lo un poco frustrante es que en algunos casos tienes que ir a la guía de youtube para poder saber donde están los saves si no puedes jugar un buen rato y no salvar tu partida ojo con eso.

You can't really use a controller to play it, considering there are 16+ different controls/buttons you need to assign -- so you have to use a keyboard and mouse. BUT the problem with doing that is the buttons wouldn't actually do anything when you clicked them. Sometimes they would work, but at least half of the time they did not. The ""locking"" onto the target and attacking them (by pressing the ""attack"" button after locking onto said target) was also overly complicated for no reason whatsoever and also barely ever worked. Considering the buttons kept NOT pressing/registering when you go to attack an enemy, you would ultimately just stand there getting murdered because the buttons would fail to register. 

Considering how long this game has been out, you would think they would have done something to fix this by now. It's not like I have a super complex or brand new computer either. It's just a standard ASUS gaming laptop (from like 2021) so I don't know what the issue is. It's ridiculous.

I spent a good 4-5 years on and off just trying to get the steam version to launch and wasn't physically able to until I did some fiddling around with code in the game files, so keep that in mind if you're planning on buying this.

Even after getting it to work, it's super buggy. If the game goes to a loading screen (which it often does) you daren't click or move anything. If you do, there's a highly likelihood that the game will completely crash.

I went in expecting really bad things as I knew the reputation. I think going in with such low expectations helped as it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Contrary to a lot of people I actually thought the story and plot twist was alright. 

One thing I really did not like though is the inclusion of Pyramid Head. PH has his purpose and it's in SH2, leave him there. 

There was also one really frustrating area with a lot of schisms that was just super annoying and took a few attempts. Thankfully once you're locked into combat with one enemy the other 6 surrounding you can't really do anything. 

It's not great. I probably wouldn't play it again, even for the other endings. It's fine as a one-time experience if you go in not expecting anything amazing.","Okay, it's not the best. I don't think I'd recommend it or not recommend it either way.

二周目通关了，一周目打了好结局
然后看了攻略，发现三角头结局好帅
然后又开了二周目，获得了三角头头套

寂静岭IP不愧是氛围恐怖的T0老大哥

2008年的游戏
放在2025年依旧很能打

其实是24年年初买的
因为下架了，然后买的国区key
当时没时间玩，一直放那
今年年初玩了2代重制版才想起来
然后找了汉化补丁才玩了

寂静岭：归乡
画质放到现在还算过得去
也就部分建模比较糊

第一次玩的时候，氛围感拉满了
可能是画质比较老的原因
就是那种残破的恐怖感很强
不知道怎么描述，反正很阴森

我感觉比2代重制版好玩
归乡的怪物很丰富，也很阴间猎奇
2代重制版太单一了，来来去去就那几个

武器也可以升级
比如你用的初始武器，就说水管吧
一开始是水管，途中捡到撬棍，就会顶替

这一代还加入处决系统
当敌人残血的时候，用重击可以进行处决

现在来说说该死的缺点
不加防闪退补丁，每玩一次，必闪退两次
而且不能频繁切屏，很容易读条卡死和闪退

其他平台我不知道，PC版优化一坨
PC版锁60，正常情况下可以稳60
但是3080玩这游戏部分场景稳不了60？

最低20～30帧，开锁解密更是锁20几帧？
从开锁解密界面退出来就回到60帧了
每次都是，重启游戏和电脑还是一样

音频更是重量级
耳机竟然只有一个声道有声音
另一半貌似没有声音，好像很小
一开始我还以为我耳机坏了
只能通过补丁来修复，体验感不是很好
嫌麻烦就没搞音频补丁，顶着玩通关了
可惜没有完整的感受到那种恐怖氛围
只能等出重制版再好好体验了

操作手感屎中屎，寂静岭祖传的手感
2代重制的手感也是屎，祖传的，改不了
不过2代重制版的闪避手感比归乡好

默认键位的设定很反人类
操作体验感稀碎
虽然可以改键位，但是设定改不了
就比如摁shift是进入攻击状态
但是这攻击状态自动索敌
不能自己转视角，况且还不能跑
你想跑的时候必须再摁一下shift
这打BOSS战给我红温完了
刚把BOSS打虚弱状态了
摁shift跑过去的时候，BOSS已经恢复了

一周目不熟悉键位设定
打BOSS战的时候打红温了
想打无伤BOSS战很吃操作熟练度

二周目的时候打的就很顺畅了
但是有角色动作僵直，还是不舒服

这一代很吃走位，因为有角色动作僵直
怪物一击给你打趴下了
你刚准备起身，又攻击你了
你起身动作就会被打断，这就很红温了
而且你被打趴下的时候挨打也会扣血

你要是打空了
怪物会使用连招，给你卡到墙角
一直给你控到死，根本不给你反击的机会

我遇到过两次
第一次就被护士卡在墙角
它就一直攻击，直到我血条消失
我人都傻了，根本动不了，闪避也没用

第二次是人体蜈蚣那里
地方小，它又大，攻击欲望又高
正好给我卡在角落一直输出，直到血条消失

虽然主角也可以用这招对付怪物
主角也有连招，同样可以给怪物控到死
普通怪物还好，BOSS战想打硬直控有点难

有坏bug也有对玩家有利的bug
可以卡出去雾气bug，太绝了
根本不需要额外打去雾MOD
卡出来之后，整个场景很敞亮
建筑看的一清二楚，很好看
还可以提前看见本来雾气里面的怪物

尽管寂静岭：归乡有很多缺点
但我玩的还是很上头
真的很喜欢寂静岭这个IP
游戏不差，就是厂商太司马了，FK科乐美

希望有生之年能等到归乡的重制版吧

目前只打了两个结局
剩下的结局还是等出重制版再好好体验吧[/h1]",

[h1] [b] [i] ★★★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆ [/i] [/b] [/h1]

Silent Hill Homecoming is a game that consistently feels like it was a fanfiction written by an occasionally semi-competent team of developers who lacked the talent to produce a proper entry in the franchise, but desperately wanted to take a crack at it anyway. Which, of course, makes it all the more baffling that this ended up being an actual mainline Silent Hill game. While not always outright a bad game, Homecoming never strays away from making sure you know the designers had very little know-how of what made the series accrue a cult following. 

[h1] [i] “I do love my son, Father. I love both my sons. But I had to make a choice, and the only way to live with that was to make sure my son never loved me. I had to make sure that he would never feel joy or compassion, all the things that make life worth living. You must understand, I was only trying to make things easier for him…. and for me.

And for this selfishness, I ask forgiveness.” [/i] [/h1]

Generally speaking, Homecoming is what you get when you assemble a team of passionate developers who harbor deep love and admiration for the source material but don’t really understand its overarching themes, symbols and meaning(s). Furthermore, the game suffers from the same affliction as the first Western Silent Hill game, Silent Hill Origins – every post-Team Silent developer seems to have been really obsessed with Silent Hill 2 and its approach to the story, and honestly? I get it. It was the most beloved entry in the series and one of the most influential game of all time, but its story was a good one-off, not something to be re-hashed over and over again. Yet here we are, fans of the original who wanted to make their own SH2 while possessing only a surface level understanding of it.

Homecoming could have worked - exchanging the usual ""just a regular guy"" archetype of a main protagonist for a soldiers, someone who is equipped to at least in part handle the horrors thrown at him by the titular town while also suffering from war-related afflictions (which would bring it close to one of the primary influences of the very first Silent Hill, Jacob's Ladder) has definitely served as an intriguing premise. Unfortunately, the execution falls completely flat, not in small part thanks to [spoiler] the fact that  Alex Shephard is, at the end, just a regular guy who deluded himself into being one [/spoiler]. This hurts all the more because the beginning of the game is actually promising, featuring the signature gloomy and uneasy atmosphere, an excellent soundtrack, and some decent character interactions. I mean, the first time you visit Alex's home, you get the familiar tingles that only a Silent Hill game can deliver. However, the more you advance through the story, the more frustrating and mentally exhausting the whole experience becomes. 

The game simply has too few redeeming factors and every pro comes with a sore con. A decent enemy variety is hampered by the fact that some of them have been imported straight from Silent Hill 2 and thus are completely out of place, captivating bosses are brought down by an abysmal combat system, interesting areas to explore clash with obnoxious progression and stupid puzzles, and a well-setup story takes a dive for the worst thanks to poor writing and inconsistent characters. This makes it difficult to praise any singular aspect of the game that has potential, because that potential largely remains unfulfilled and always comes with a negative and prominent asterisk. Add to that the fact that this is a shoddy PC port that simply doesn't work without copious fixes and even then you'd be lucky not to run into some kind of annoying issue and you've got and alright game at best that few would be hard-pressed to recommend going out of your way to so much as launch. 

It really is disappointing to see that Homecoming is the only (older) Silent Hill game on Steam. While it is not necessarily the worst game out there, it definitely is the worst Silent Hill game...

Add to that the fact that this is a shoddy PC port that simply doesn't work without copious fixes and even then you'd be lucky not to run into some kind of annoying issue and you've got and alright game at best that few would be hard-pressed to recommend going out of your way to so much as launch. 

It really is disappointing to see that Homecoming is the only (older) Silent Hill game on Steam. While it is not necessarily the worst game out there, it definitely is the worst Silent Hill game...

I was shocked to see the incredibly bad reception the game has here on Steam but than I read the reviews and it seems to be mostly about the games PC performance rather than about the game.

So the question is, if the game works is it good? Is it Silent Hill?

Well i'm here to report that so far the game runs near superb. I'm playing on Steamdeck and have yet to run into any of the performance complaints on here. Steamdeck is weird because alot of games don't run well on PC but for some reasons they run almost perfect on Steamdeck.

The issue I can report so far is that the game will sometimes do a mini-pause for a few miliseconds(less than half a second), it's noticeable but happens so quickly and doesn't interupt anything that it's not a convenience at all or impacts the game in any way, it rarely happens but, just seems to happens sometimes when you enter new areas.

Now about the game, is SH5 good? So far my time with the game has been great. When Homecoming first came out I skipped out on it because almost all the reviews were negative, calling it dated, a step down and not much like SH. Essentially this wasn't the SH5 we expected and were left wanting a true Silent Hill 5 installment. Well I was a fool, I've learned in todays gaming that professional reviews arent good anymore, so its todays gaming its better to rely on user reviews, but now that is starting to have its own problems, so using reviews has evolved to a point where you now have to look for user reviews who aren't emotional or unobjective in their reviews.

I was led to believe for yrs and yrs this wasn't a true sequel but now that ive finally tried it this truely is Silent Hill 5. The graphics are great for the time that it came out, and the graphics on this game was slept on, this game is clearly of the early adopters of complex lighting and shadows, something that you're not use to in SH games(not counting remake) The quality of the shadows is so good in some moments in creates tension, atmosphere and scares. I'm a big fan of horror games that use good use of shadows for visual storytelling and atmosphere. 

Homecoming is the natural next step/evolution of what SH3 and 4 did. Basically if you love the first 4 games, this game feel exactly like those game but slightly better with quality of life changes. And the devs Double Helix did not get the kudos they deserve for nailing taking over the reins and understanding and nailing the gameplay and atmosphere of SH, you cant even tell the change in devs. The camera here is better than the 4, giving you full control of movement now. The combat is exactly the same, its still clunky, simple and slow but thats the charm of it, SH isnt about combat, its about survival, they did however improve the quality of combat so that there's better ways to attack and aim, there's also variety with melee attacks now beyond just charging the attack. The game now has a dodge button now but isn't OP or makes things less difficult, it covers little space if you have a weapon drawn. The voice acting and dialogue is just as campy and weird and typical SH. The Story so far is interesting, this is more of a SH2 type story than part 1, 2 or 4. The characters are also weird in this game just like in previous games. The games music is great, they brought back the music conductor from SH1 and 2. So the game feels even more like the SH you want. They even nailed how the fog should work in this game! When I first read the reviews for SH5 when it came out they complained that the game was dated and felt the same with little evolution. This was during a time were ppl were fixed with franchises having to reinvent the wheel, making a sequel that did more of the the same was seen as bad or lazy. Which was weird because we came from an era where we wanted sequels to be more of the same because we loved how the games felt. This is why you have OG Megaman with 7 sequels that played exactly the same with only quality of life updates and new content, or Donkey Country 1-3 that dont veer drastically away from the formula. But for some reason during the PS3/360 era games were expected to reinvent themselves with modern mechanics, you can blame games like RE4, FF12, GTA4, Metroid Prime for this. Tomb Raider had a similar issue TR4-6 all got bad reviews for playing and feeling the same as the first 3 games. But now look at modern and retro reviews those games all have high praise now because they cater to ppl who loved the first 3 games and wanted more of the same experience, and TR4-6 delivers on that. Thankfully we're back to an era of gaming where we now love and welcome games that don't need to reinvent themselves, embracing games that give us more of what we loved.

All in all, ive loved my time with the game so far, I usually don't leave early reviews but seeing how much ived enjoyed the game, and how long ive spent wondering if it was worth trying because I love Silent Hill franchise and wanted more of what part 1-4 gave me, I understand the need to find a review that addresses what you're looking for, is Homecoming good and does it feels like SH? And thats a big yes, this feels exactly like what you imagined a Silent Hill 5 game should feel like, it feels like part 1-4 with some small steps forward in the design.

The only minor complaint is the uses a film grain style that's a little too gray and alittle too static-y.

All in all if you're a Silent Hill fan, this is a must have game so far. I'm sorry I skipped on it.

1- sensibilidad bugeada (tuve que cambiarla desde las opciones de Steam del mando y luego no podía apuntar bien con las armas)

2- Bugs de iluminación y sombras (no muchos pero hay)

3- No aparecían los botones para hacer los quick time events (los tuve que hacer a pura chorra)

4- Rendimiento penoso (aparecen 3 libélulas con un perro y el juego quiere hacerse el harakiri)

5- La cámara clipeaba a veces cuando los enemigos me hacían un agarre.

6- Crasheo una vez y al abrir el juego de nuevo no le hacia daño a los enemigos (jaja gracioso)
7- Freezeaba en una zona que había un grupo de enfermeras (lo solucione literalmente a escopetazos)

8- en cinemáticas las pistas de audio de los personajes se escuchaban mucho más por el auricular izquierdo que por el derecho (no es tan grave pero molesta)

9- En las bossfights no había soundtrack (literalmente he peleado todos los bosses del juego en completo silencio pero lo que me molesta es que miré en Youtube las peleas con el ost y ganan un montón)

10-No había canción en los créditos (después de terminar el juego y ver los créditos completamente en silencio se me quedó el pecho bastante frío)",

The lag and bugs were super annoying.

However, once I pushed through that rough start, I began to enjoy the game. The monsters are bizarre and unsettling, adding to the eerie atmosphere, and I found ammo to be rare which added to the challenge and annoyed me a little bit too. The combat system felt a bit clunky, especially during boss fights. I struggled against one boss who had this grab move that was nearly impossible to dodge. But after some practice with the controls and learning to switch quickly between combat and walking stances, I finally figured out how to dodge that loser boss.

Это были далёкие времена, когда у меня ещё даже моего первого ноута не было, но я, уже не помню по какой причине, но поверхностно знал, кто такой ""холм тишины"".
  Тогда мой бывший одноклассник своровал в нашем местном магазине с дисками 32 или 33 диска (да, я это запомнил). Среди низкосортных сериалов и фильмов, разного сорта паршивости были и своего рода алмазы; сборник готики, сборник какой-то параши, из которого я помню только эту странную игру ""the ball"" и ставшую одной из моих любимых игр ""Я не умер в конце zombie draver-а"", а также сборник ""холма тишины"". Я точно не помню, сколько и какие именно части там были, но есть 2 которые отпечались в моей памяти мне кажется навечно: - Silent hill 3 и Silent hill: Homecoming. 
  Когда не было, на чём мне это запустить, я просто вечерами таращился и на скрины сайлента, перечитывая раз за разом краткое содержание игры и просто мечтал когда-нибудь это запустить, используя в своих мечтах коробку от конфет, которая открывалась как ноутбук. 
  Спустя некоторое время ноут у меня появился, и я установил тот самый Холм тишины 3. Я думал, что буду просто поглощать эту игру не взирая ни на что. Моё желание прикоснуться к Хизер... То есть к СХ 3 временами начало граничить с одержимостью. По - моему у меня на тот момент был уже небольшой игровой опыт, и поэтому я думал, что игра меня ничем не удивит... 
Знаете, моя история знакомства с СХ 3 похожа на этот прикол: 
 - Я тебя так отымею, что ты ходить не сможешь!
 - Да я только За!
 - А что это за татуха? 
 - Это п*зда.
Хотя я думаю, что даже последней фразой этого прекола можно охарактеризовать моё первое знакомство с СХ 3. 
 Прилетаю я домой со школы, даже не переодеваясь сажусь за ноут и врубаю ту самую игру мечты и... получаю страх всей жизни! 
 Видите ли, во время загрузки или первого запуска там есть момент, когда вам показывают чёрные карусели с видом сверху и что-то похожее на лошадиную голову, которою неистово колбасит. Тогда был солнечный день и солнце светило даже у меня в комнате, но после этой сцены я боялся даже срать идти без включенного на фоне телека. Я много раз смотрел прохождение этой игры и даже само это интро пересматривал несколько раз, ради так сказать адреналинчика, но сам я никогда решусь в неё вернуться. Это  прям мой скриптонит. 
  Ну а с Homecoming у меня связано одно из самых тёплых воспоминаний. Этого достаточно.  
 Помню как будучи мальцом, застрял на головоломке с проводами и поэтому просто удалил игру. Сейчас я, ничего не поняв, прошёл её вообще случайно. 
   P.S. Если кто-то захочет прикоснуться к этому музейному экспонату, хочу дать лишь 1 совет: Выключите зернистость плёнки. Напрямую в игре в этого никак не сделаете, придётся искать решение в инете, но оно того стоит. 
  Да, это не обзор, в привычном его понимании, просто я не сильно понимаю, кому вообще нужны обзоры на СХ в 2025 веке. Это просто личные воспоминания, записанные таким образом.",

Estava quase desistindo de jogar e deixar esse jogo de lado, até que  consegui instalar um patch de correções disponibilizado no Github chamado de unknownproject.
Alguns canais no YouTube ensinam como fazer a instalação e o patch tem alterações como: Fps e até bugs corrigidos.
Por se tratar de um projeto de terceiros, tive receio em instalar. Mas, funcionou tranquilo. Por que se for esperar pela Konami uma atualização é brincadeira KKKK
Não compensa comprar um jogo assim, atualmente no momento que estou fazendo essa análise ele está custando em preço cheio R$ 34,99 mas em promoção está R$ 6,99 e absolutamente não vale a pena.

No właśnie ""było"", bo ta gra to niestety koniec końców jedna wielka tragedia. Na początek może jakieś plusy, bo o dziwo są takie: świetne designy potworów, bardzo klimatyczne lokacje na ulicach i naprawdę dobry soundtrack; no i w sumie to tyle... Bardzo denerwujące jest to, że gra nic nie tłumaczy: dostaje komendę otwórz drzwi, albo sprawdź przedmiot i nie wiem co zrobić; nic nie pisze jakiego klawisza mam użyć, co najbardziej widoczne było przy pierwszym przeciwniku - dla mnie oczywiste jest to, że atakuje się LMB, więc klikam i nic się nie dzieje... no dobra może RMB, też nic... Wszedłem se w opcje i okazuje się, że trzeba nacisnąć lewy shift żeby postać zrobiła gardę i zaczęła poruszać się z prędkością żółwią (nie obrażając przy tym żółwi). System walki jest strasznie toporny i drewniany, a hitboxy wrogów są przeogromne; uniki często nic nie dają. Lokacje poza ulicami są pozbawione klimatu horroru. Szczerze to przez większość czasu gra jest bardziej komedią niż horrorem, fabuła jest po prostu średnia i nie pomaga temu beznadziejna gra aktorska; jakieś 90% dialogów opiera się na tym, że główny bohater o coś się pyta, a druga osoba albo kompletnie ignoruje jego pytanie, albo go wyzywa od idiotów... co w sumie jest prawdą, bo gościu jest tak samo głupi na końcu jak i na początku. Nie które dialogi są ultra ciche, a inne za to mega głośne. A na deser powiem jeszcze, że gra zcrashowała się łącznie 8 razy. Moja ocena to 1/10. Całkowicie odradzam, omijać szerokim łukiem.",

185972705,brazilian,2025.00.20 01:19,❌,✅,0.6230529547,10,"Horrível. Um dos piores jogos que já joguei, e certamente o pior da franquia Silent Hill. E isso me entristece bastante.

Completamente mal otimizado para o PC, lotado de bugs. Você é forçado a baixar um patch feito por fãs na internet para deixar o jogo viável, caso contrário enfrentará vários crashs, graficos zoados e até audios mau produzidos.

A história do jogo é outra faca no seu estômago. Quando você finalmente entende o que está acontecendo, dá para perceber que tinha um potencial de ser uma ótima história, mas é tão mal executado que só resta tristeza, ódio e decepção. Os roteiristas e principalmente quem que estava a cargo de dirigir as cutscenes não faziam a minima ideia do que estavam fazendo, NADA é coerente, NADA faz sentido, NADA é bem executado, TODA e QUALQUER storyline do jogo que tenta te fazer sentir algo te faz sentir apenas nojo pelo jeito podre que é feito.

Os personagens, então? A maioria é inutil ou vazia de personalidade.

Os finais são uma palhaçada. São completamente do nada e há lógica minima em como pegá-los. Todos os finais são possíveis na primeira run, o que é um pecado enorme, visto que o final UFO (o final piada que tem em quase todos os jogos) pode ser pego logo de cara. E foi isso que aconteceu comigo. Imagina você pegar o final piada depois de todo esse sofrimento? Nada recompensador. Os outros jogos tinham seus finais principais, que eram os únicos que podiam ser pegos em uma primeira run, e os finais secundários que só poderiam ser pegos em futuras runs. Isso é justamente para evitar esse tipo de situação ridicula.

Outro aspecto que Homecoming faz questão de mudar para o pior, é na forma de obtenção dos finais. Ao invés dos finais serem obtidos baseado em como você joga o jogo, eles simplesmente colocam 3 decisões bem na sua cara e faz você escolher a resposta que você quer dar. Não somente tem nada a ver com nenhuma entrada anterior de Silent Hill como as escolhas tem pouca correlação com os finais, podendo dar a impressão de que você está pegando um final aleatório mesmo.

O jogo é tão ruim em sua narrativa que cria furos terríveis que entram em conflito com histórias anteriores, ferrando completamente o canone já complicado de Silent Hill, tanto que em um futuro jogo tiveram que tentar ""consertar"" as cagas desse (spoiler: não conseguiram). Chega a ser uma ofensa o quão despreocupados o desenvolvedores foram ao criar a história.

Os gráficos são ok para a época. Mas não tem porquê parabeniza-los por isso pois era obrigação deles, visto que é uma franquia de nome grande.

Os monstros são, surpreendentemente, interessantes. Há designs ali que são genuinamente bons, principalmente de alguns bosses, mas é apenas isso. Até alguns dos bons designes são na verdade cópias de outros monstros da franquia, o que não é exatamente algo bom em Silent Hill. Afinal, a franquia sempre prezou por monstros novos do que reaproveitados. 

A aparência dos monstros infelizmente é acompanhada do combate terrível. O jogos antes desse são conhecidos por terem um ""combate ruim"", mas a ruindade é intencional. Neste jogo, porém, eles tentam fazer o combate ser ""bom"" e ""dinâmico"", mas acabam falhando, fazendo ele ser ruim também. Esse é o problema: os outros jogos tem um combate ruim proposital e usam isso como parte do game design, girando em torno disso, e mesmo sendo ""ruins"" eles continuam sendo viaveis. Esse jogo entretanto trabalha na suposição de que o combate dele é bom e que você está se divertindo nas lutas, o que, infelizmente, é completamente fora da realidade. Se você era do tipo de jogador que evitava combate e fugia dos inimigos nos jogos anteriores, você vai intensificar esse comportamento ainda mais nesse jogo. Mas se você era do tipo que ia atrás de matar todos eles... bom, você provavelmente vai se decepcionar bastante nesse jogo aqui. Não é divertido, é torturante.

 As músicas são, finalmente, um ponto positivo genuino. A única parte boa do jogo. Mas esse não tinha como errar, afinal Akira Yamaoka sempre fez um ótimo trabalho em todos os jogos da franquia.

Resumindo: Não jogue isso caso você não seja um fã fervoroso de Silent Hill. Até eu que sou apaixonado pela franquia odiei com todas as minhas forças terminar esse jogo.",
185918132,english,2025.00.19 10:23,✅,❌,0.462068975,2,"Silent Hill: Homecoming is an ambitious entry in the legendary survival horror series, blending the psychological terror the franchise is known for with a heavier emphasis on action and combat. 
While it has its moments, the game doesn’t quite capture the haunting magic of its predecessors, leaving fans with a mixed bag of eerie atmosphere and inconsistent execution.
The story follows Alex Shepherd, a soldier returning to his hometown of Shepherd’s Glen after receiving disturbing visions about his brother. 
The narrative dives into themes of family trauma, guilt, and buried secrets, providing a solid emotional core. 
As Alex unravels the mystery, he ventures into the fog-laden streets of Silent Hill, encountering grotesque monsters, twisted cults, and unnerving environments that keep you on edge.
Visually, the game excels in creating a chilling atmosphere. 
The foggy streets, decrepit buildings, and grotesque creature designs are deeply unsettling, staying true to the series’ tradition of immersive world-building. 
The lighting and sound design also deserve praise, with every creak, whisper, and distant cry adding to the tension.
However, where Homecoming stumbles is in its gameplay. 
The combat system, while more robust than in earlier entries, leans too heavily on action, sometimes at the expense of tension. 
Alex’s proficiency with weapons and dodging mechanics makes the encounters feel more like an action game than the survival horror experience fans might expect. 
While the puzzles provide some respite, they lack the creativity and challenge that defined earlier installments.
Another divisive aspect is the reliance on jump scares over psychological dread. 
While some moments genuinely unsettle, others feel cheap or predictable, pulling you out of the immersive horror the series is known for.
Despite its flaws, Silent Hill: Homecoming is not without merit. 
It introduces intriguing lore, expands on the mythos of Silent Hill, and offers a visually engaging journey for those willing to overlook its shortcomings. 
While it doesn’t quite reach the heights of classics like Silent Hill 2 or Silent Hill 3, it’s a decent, albeit flawed, entry that may appeal more to action-horror enthusiasts than die-hard Silent Hill purists.
A solid attempt that misses the mark but still offers a glimpse of the horror franchise’s potential.","Silent Hill: Homecoming is an ambitious entry in the legendary survival horror series, blending the psychological terror the franchise is known for with a heavier emphasis on action and combat.

La única forma legal de jugar este juegos es desde PC o con una consola antigua

La versión de PC es mala, y no hay mucho más que decir (he tenido 1 crasheo por lo que recomiendo ir guardando siempre que puedas, en cambios de escenarios después de cinemáticas o al guardar partida puedes estar 15-20seg con la imagen congelada esperando a que responda. El audio es mono, así que con auriculares no está bien configurado…etc)

Pero hablando en si del juego
Me ha gustado y entretenido mucho, tiene muy malas críticas y es la oveja negra, pero lo he disfrutado y gustado.
Puede que no esté a la altura de sus predecesores como sh1 o 2 pero no es para nada un mal juego.

Tiene buenos personajes, buena historia, buena ambientación, como si fuera de ps2 con ese estilo retro y granulado. Con muchas representaciones y simbolismos 

Para mi vale la pena jugarlo y lo recomiendo por su historia/ambientación.
Unas 12h bien divertidas que si ignoras esos 15/20seg puntuales lo disfrutarás

I would like to commend the game on its monster and boss design, as well on its overall mood and music. That being said, those are the only redeemable qualities to it.

I am perplexed on how this barely playable mess of a game was release in the first place. The loading alone takes forever.

Should you finally manage to get the game running and stop it from crashing all the time (and in order to do so, you must disable the steam overlay, change the resolution to 1280x720, change the video quality from high to medium, subtitles must be off, and try using Windows XP/7 compatibility mode), I seriously doubt you will find this small victory rewarding.
This game has one of the worst gameplay mechanics I have ever experienced. 

The character you play as, Alex, is so sluggish when confronting enemies. The dodge mechanic is virtually useless, as it too is really slow, thus taking damage is, basically, inevitable. The fact that Alex steps away from enemies while fighting them with each hit, despite there being a lock-on mechanism, is also quite unfortunate.
The hit boxes are also a mess.

In conclusion – If you are a massive ‘’Silent Hill’’ fan and a completionist, then, I suppose, you’ll just have to suffer through.
If you are more on the casual side or, like myself, are getting re-introduced to the franchise – we have ‘’Silent Hill 2’’ the remake available on Steam now.
So, play that.

You are welcome.

Cheers!

Although having horrific imagery, it lacks the sustainable dread imo. The main character ws hrd for me to connect with and although i don't have alot of hours on steam, i played originally on xbox 360.
Important to note: Alot of the enemies can 100% stun lock you, some of the bosses can stun lock you, soft locking out of winning, some of the higher difficulties can soft lock you because it may not provide you enough ammo. 
If your gonna play the game, just never turn your flashlight on.

You also have the ammo issue even on normal mode, by the time i got to the Scarlet boss fight (it was hell) i was low HP and left with only melee, struggled for 3 days to beat that boss fight.

Es stürzt ab wenn man raustabt, manchmal bekommt man auf ewig blackscreen wenn man die Grafik ändert, es stürzt allgemein ab wenn man es über 700 Pixel spielt was nicht nur manchmal oder nur bei mir der Fall ist, Legit ist es nicht möglich über 700 Pixel zu spielen da es sonst abstürzt und es gibt nichts was man dagegen machen kann, die Steuerung ist komplett schwammig, die Tastenbelegung ist einfach nur akward besonders auf Kontroller, der Sound ist komplett hinüber manche Dinge sind zu leise manche zu laut du Hörst den Charakter und andere npcs viel zu leise mit auf einem Ohr, manche Sounds tuen wirklich in den Ohren weh und zwar nicht weil sie zu laut sind sondern weil es einfach nur gottlos scheiße klingt, die Karte ist bei mir verbuggt es wird nur ein Achtel davon angezeigt und Neustartrn bringt nichts, die Maus ist bei mir ebenfalls oft verbuggt aka ich habe die normale Maus und die ingame Maus parallel ingame was bedeutet das du dich nicht umdrehen kannst was auch bedeutet das du leaven musst was auch bedeutet das du deine Speicher verlierst da man nur bei bestimmten Punkten speichern kann also nicht im Menü, du hast einen 30 FPS lock

Now that konami is trying to revive the Silent Hill saga with the remake if SH2, and new releases they should fix this piece of garbabage this port is. i give it a chance and bought it in an offer for like 2€ and still i feel robbed. Use the money to either buy 4 on GOG or SH2Re."

They(other games) have an overwhelmingly positive reputation, so my advice is, if you have a real decent and updated system setup, just put a very decent ssd on it, because 80% of these issues(problems) will disappear.


And here is a fix for the black screen:

if you still experience black screen on launch.

Go to <path-to-game>\Engine\
Open vars_pc.cfg file with a text editor.
Change ScreenResHeight=
ScreenResWidth= to the desired resolution.

Notes

Resolutions above 1920x1080 may cause the map and examined inventory items to not display properly.

if a vars_pc.cfg doesnt exist in engine folder create it and add desired screen resolution



OBS: It's the closest decent thing near the ""OUTLAST"" experience, but with guns. And if this isin't enough 4 u, then i advice you to watch a movie that goes by the name of, ""House on Haunted Hill"", the 1999 version, and look for a character that goes by the name of, 
Dr. Richard Benjamin Vannacutt, and not a RPG game claiming to be a horror game.","I see lots of complaints about this game, but i play other games(EVIL WITHIM) with the same issues, glitches and bugs, and guess what?

Prós:
1.	Atmosfera e Narrativa: Silent Hill: Homecoming mantém a atmosfera sombria e a narrativa envolvente que a série é conhecida. A história de Alex Shepherd e sua busca por seu irmão desaparecido é intrigante e cheia de reviravoltas.
2.	Design de Som: A trilha sonora e os efeitos sonoros são de alta qualidade, contribuindo para a imersão no mundo assustador de Silent Hill.
3.	Gráficos: Os gráficos são detalhados e bem trabalhados, especialmente considerando a época de lançamento do jogo. As criaturas e os cenários são visualmente impressionantes e perturbadores.
Contras:
1.	Problemas de Performance: A versão para PC de Silent Hill: Homecoming sofre com diversos problemas de performance. Muitos jogadores relatam quedas de frame rate, travamentos e bugs que podem atrapalhar a experiência de jogo.
2.	Controles: Os controles no PC são considerados pouco responsivos e mal otimizados. A falta de suporte adequado para controles de jogo e a configuração de teclado e mouse podem tornar a jogabilidade frustrante.
3.	Compatibilidade: O jogo apresenta problemas de compatibilidade com sistemas operacionais modernos, o que pode exigir ajustes e patches adicionais para funcionar corretamente (melhor maneira de se jogar é apelando para mods).
4.	Ausência de Atualizações: A falta de atualizações e suporte contínuo por parte dos desenvolvedores deixou muitos dos problemas técnicos sem solução, o que é decepcionante para os fãs da série.
Conclusão: Silent Hill: Homecoming para PC é um jogo que oferece uma experiência narrativa rica e uma atmosfera assustadora, mas é prejudicado por problemas técnicos significativos. Se você é um fã dedicado da série e está disposto a lidar com os desafios técnicos, pode encontrar valor no jogo. No entanto, para a maioria dos jogadores, a versão para PC pode ser uma experiência frustrante devido aos seus inúmeros problemas de performance e compatibilidade.

The writing on this can be described as painfully literal in a world that has been built in the abstract. The art looks nice, but is mostly without thought and not relevant to the narrative at all. Certain stand-outs feel refreshing, but lack any punch when combined with a, frankly, boring and contrived world. It feels more like an amusement park where you're supposed to clap at the things you remember, rather than think about the things you see and hear.

The ending doesn't really make any sense, and it feels as if it's constructed to try and replicate the highs of Silent Hill 2. It does not land at all, and weakens a lot of the themes regarding abuse. 

Silent Hill has never really been strong in the combat department, so I wouldn't hold it too much against this game normally.

This game does it's best to try and replicate Resident Evil 4 in presentation while trying to play to the combat structure of the previous games. It fails on almost every single level. The camera and focus of the combat is very clearly focused on ranged combat, as Resident Evil 4 is, but the game restricts ranged ammunition much more than previous entries. As such you're left with a clunky combat system that ends up with just knife spam by the end of the game. 

Also Pyramid Head's inclusion in this game as Bogeyman just hurts the game. Not only is it lazy, but it's not satisfying at all. You can tell there was debate on the inclusion of ""Bogeyman"" which lead to just 2 occurrences that is very much not satisfying. Fan service drivel.

177962198,schinese,2024.09.29 12:11,✅,❌,0.6631866693,15,"童年的恐怖类游戏启蒙就是起源和破碎的记忆，之后从原版2一路体验到6，2是公认的系列巅峰，不过在我心里破碎的记忆可以说仅次于2，。寂静岭对后世恐怖游戏的发展起到了非常好的启蒙作用，寂静岭系列大概分两个时代，起初一直都是team silent来制作，科乐美从销售观察出这个系列在日本一直不温不火，主要盈利都来自欧美国家，因此科乐美在4之后解散了team silent，用外包的方式制作了起源，破碎的记忆，归乡，暴雨。但除了起源和破碎的记忆外，剩下的作品不管评价还是人气都惨不忍睹。例如归乡在ps3，xbox，steam都有，结果销量只有惨淡的20万，再加上盗版猖狂，科乐美就抛弃了pc，之后的寂静岭2/3HD，暴雨都只有PS3和xbox版本。
在体验过前面的作品后来到归乡就会感觉到风格从心理恐怖暗示变成了美式惊悚，玩家扮演退伍军人阿历克斯寻找自己弟弟约书亚，在游戏中需要紧跟他的脚步，随着剧情抽丝剥茧，逐渐接近真相，这和2詹姆士追寻玛利娅很像，但是5在这个过程中把很多暗示和解释做的很明显，没有太多2里的朦胧感，在游戏到一半就容易让人猜到真相。
在归乡中同样也有充满绣铁，发霉，血的里世界，并且在表里世界的切换表现上采用了电影里的创意，周围墙壁会有一块块掉落的效果，不过对比前面的作品还是能感受到不同，更像是废墟。其他地方也能发现很多和电影相似的，护士，教徒，以及只为客串来露个脸的三角头，感觉就像是电影的同人游戏一样。
在ui和战斗方面对比前面的作品也有了一些改变，武器可以蓄力，还可以连击，再加上闪避功能和终结，更像是个动作游戏，而且武器可以开各种锁，比如斧头可以劈开木板、小刀可以划开里世界的墙。而且这游戏小刀几乎无敌，成为继生化危机又一个小刀无敌的游戏。
而游戏的缺点也是非常明显且致命，各种bug，以及打齐了补丁都会崩溃，我的存档已经莫名坏了两次…
另一个问题就是大量的尸体，虽然说恐怖游戏几乎都爱用尸体来渲染气氛，但在寂静岭这个几乎每一个物品都是充满暗示的游戏中，归乡却没有详细说明尸体出现的原因，对比之下2在这一点就做的很好，而且从1到4，游戏里很少把尸体直接放在明面上，比如起源和2的停尸间，只会看到手或者脚。3的医院里，尸体上会用床单盖着，只能看到轮廓。当调查时候主角还会说:我不会想碰这东西。所以归乡这样大量的尸体放在明面上反而更像生化危机和死亡空间的感觉。
还有怪物的设定，前面作品里怪物都有其象征的意义，但是归乡里的怪物却几乎没有什么代表性，唯一让我印象深刻的就是娃娃boss，因为那段音乐做的很好…
1的怪物是阿蕾莎心理的恐惧映射所构成的。2是詹姆士和其他角色心理的恐惧或噩梦所具现而成的，厚布包裹的场景也是詹姆士用枕头闷死玛丽的潜意识表现。3是雪柔自身对过去的投射，蠕动的血和铁锈里世界更是造就寂静岭的经典；4的怪物都是牺牲者化身的，以及颠倒世界代表主角小时候去找妈妈时，对城市复杂的道路的恐惧。对比之下，归乡很多东西反而更像是为了恐怖而恐怖，尤其教徒这种完全算是普通人类的敌人，从理论上不管表世界或里世界，都已经脱离了现实，因为只有被这个世界拉进来的人才会出现在这里，所以历代出现的人类角色数量很少。
因为这些，归乡变得像生化危机4一样，变成动作冒险游戏了，可是生化危机转型得很成功，成功继承了生化危机的名号，归乡的话如果把寂静岭这个名字去掉或许还是个不错的新游戏，但保留了寂静岭的名号又没能继承寂静岭的精髓，就导致没法被所有人接受。",

-Por lo poco que pude jugar no esta tan malo el juego como me lo imaginaba
-El juego da algo de miedo como todo Silent Hill 
-Los enemigos tienen un diseño normalito, puede llegar a asustar (muy pocas veces), pero no es algo que incomode o llegue a ser ni remotamente comparable a los diseños hechos por Masahiro Ito
-La musica de Akira Yamaoka es excelente como siempre, y se podria decir que lo mejor del juego

...

Ahora vamos con la malo y en esto hablare de la calidad de este port
-El juego esta horriblemente porteado, se me ha crasheado mas de 5 veces y los fps son una mierda, yo no soy muy exigente con los fps pero por lo menos dame 30
-El juego tiene un problema con las voces, el audio esta roto en las cinematicas, haciendo que las voces de los personajes que no sean Alex no se escuchen, para poder jugar con las voces ien implementadas tienes que descargar un mod
-La saga Silent Hill siempre se a caracterisado por tener un combate incomodo ya que los protagonistas son humanos, pero lo de este juego es otra cosa. Combatir con enemigos en este juego es una tortura, es complicado esquivar a los enemigos ya que aveces esquivas e igual te dan, y que bajen los fps a la hora de pelear tampoco ayuda; algunos dicen que los fans de Silent Hill hipocritas por gustarles el combate del remake si es lo mismo que homecoming, pero la verdad es que el combate de Silent Hill 2 es infinitamente superior y mas comodo que este
-Los controles con super incomodos y horribles
-Como dije antes no pude jugar todo el juego, y eso porque el juego se trabo totalmente porque intente bajarle la resolucion para ver si iba mejor y de esa forma el juego murio totalmente, cuando lo abro ahora solo se ve una pantalla negra

Este juego y port an sido claramente olvidado por Konami, pero no solo por Konami, tambien a sido olvidado por los propios fans, por ejemplo, el Silent Hill 2 original de PC tambien salio horrible pero los fans se encargaron de hacerle parches e incluso hicieron las version definitiva para jugar al clasico que es Silent Hill 2 Enhanced Edition, pero encontrar parches que arreglen Silent Hill Homecoming es muy complicado ya que pocos se interesaron en hacerle parches para arreglarlo, ya que el juego es visto como uno de los peores Silent Hills, lo que es normal ya que es Silent Hill muy generico

Este juego es un 3/10, no recomiendo comprarlo, Si quieres jugar en Silent Hill y aun no tienes dinero para el remake, mejor juga Silent Hill 2 Enhanced Edition o los demas clasicos en emulador ya que este no es un buen juego para empezar la saga",

This port is trash, there is not much more to say unfortunately...it crashes roughly every 2-3 hours and when it doesn't fully crash it completely freezes for 20-30 seconds. I've tried both PC and Steam Deck with same results.

电子游戏发展至今，有一款恐怖游戏广为人知，即使你没有玩过游戏，也很大概率听说过它的名字——寂静岭。（评论区提供汉化方法）
[h3]F**K Konami[/h3]
众所周知，有钱不赚是傻蛋，而科乐美正是这样做的傻蛋。由于科乐美的原因，寂静岭系列目前在Steam上对中国区锁区且没有官方中文。早有耳闻寂静岭系列第五代《寂静岭：归乡》是寂静岭集大成之作，当我在steampy看到低价大甩卖的激活码时，就买了一个。然后在网上找到了汉化补丁。
[h3]痛并快乐着[/h3]
本作在视听效果上下了很大功夫，里面的怪物仿佛是从设计者的噩梦中逃出来的，光是造型就让人竖汗毛冒冷汗。不过，这些怪物基本上都是战斗力为五的渣渣，你大部分时候可以选择弄死它们或者撒丫子逃跑。因此，一开始的害怕感会逐渐消散，理智逐渐占据上风。优质的配乐，与场景的契合度没有百分百也至少有百分之九十了，有几次我甚至特意控制角色停下脚步，只为了多听一会儿。
[h3]高情商恐怖[/h3]
在游戏选择上，我不是一个只看外表的人。对我而言，游戏的画质并不是重点。所以我可以耐着性子看完每段CG，剧情给我感觉不是一般的那种无脑的恐怖游戏。随后在网上了解了一下游戏背景，是讲述邪教与类似于克苏鲁背景下，普通人的悲剧与救赎。寂静岭系列主打玩法是解谜，战斗是其次，但五代归乡战斗的占比感觉也可以说是主要玩法了。玩完本作之后，我发现其实我不会像之前那样，想要急切跨区购买，尝尝二代重制版咸淡。
[h3]后日谈[/h3]
本作故事上走的悬疑路线，同时满足了玩家猎奇的心理，但不是纯粹让人看个爽。至少是通过悲惨的故事让我意识到邪教和迷信可以有多可怕。通关后我想说，这游戏是我玩过最深刻的反邪教游戏。但是解谜对于我来说，在我一边爽玩的同时又在消磨着我的热情，所以我现在可以肯定的是，我能等到寂静岭2重制版打折时，甚至进包？的时候再出手购买了。

Eu curto muito o enredo desse jogo, sua narrativa nem tanto, mas me interesso no mistério da família shepherd, o final recompensa com as revelações mas acaba de forma seca e sem sal demais e os personagens secundários são fds kkk (e tem toda essa patifaria de outra cidade além de silent que pow, pataquada do karai kkkk). A gameplay do jogo é bem truncada e alguns QTE não funcionam sempre mas no geral eu consigo ter uma gameplay minimamente satisfatória, e os gráficos pra época eram decentes, (as expressões faciais dos personagens em gameplay são HORRÍVEIS kk) o map design deixa muito a desejar mas não me incomoda muito. O que realmente quebra é essa otimização no PC que é INFAME, UMA NOJEIRA, jogo travado a 30 fps e com quedas bruscas, lotados de bugs e crashs que entendo quem desistir no meio por isso. diante disso tudo, sei que não é grande jogo, mas ainda assim me apetece muito e gosto da história dele.",

On newer systems, it's nearly unplayable, with constant technical issues. The game crashes frequently, often setting you back far too much, I have crashed 2 times at the same point and it would put me back nearly 15 min of game-time and 1 fully unavoidable cutscene. 

The story itself is decent, but it's hard to appreciate when you're fighting through bugs and performance problems.

This port just isn’t worth the frustration and headache. If you're interested, wait for a steep discount—I picked it up for $9. At $40, it's just absurd.

Do NOT minimize the window, you'll crash when you try to reopen it.
Do NOT use the steam overlay, your cursor will get messed up and you'll have to minimize to fix it, and then crash.
There's a glitch where projectile weapons don't make collision, so test a save file. Shoot into a wall, bullet hole = good to go. No hole = reload the save file.

Above all, when the game freezes. DO NOT MOVE OR PRESS BUTTONS. Just let it load. Towards the end, the freezes take up to 60-90 seconds, but it will come back if you don't hit additional inputs.

-Well first off the gameplay is janky, clunky, and aggravating. Why the fuk do I have to click shift from going from running to combat mode. I've played games with jank movement but this game takes the cake. 0/10 gameplay

-Secondly the graphics are something atrocious, certainly an eye straining hell. I get that it came out in 2008. But what else came out that year? Dead space. No excuse for this game to look worse than a fuckin PS1 game!!!!

-Third game freezes up at every save spot and at random occasions. Let's play a game of Is It GOnna CrASH?

-fourth unskippable dialog hell. Say you die. Well now there's a good chance u lost progress up to a certain point and gotta talk to characters. You have to listen to them all over with now way to skip. STFU and let me skipppp ffs...

-Fifth a $40 price tag. I mean I got it on sale for $8 and honestly that much was a rip. This garbage should be free but well.... EVEN FREE I'D NEVER PLAY THIS CRAP!!!

-The only redeeming quality is the atmosphere and story but it is ruined by how aggravated I was playing this trash. Oh a scary monster appeared? I'm not immersed or scared because the combat is so jank that the rage induced is burning my blood pressure so high that I'm gonna have a hard attack in my 30's.

Grafika 4/10 - Hra vypadá šíleně zastarale, má dost prázdné lokace kde je třeba 10 dveří ale vejít můžete jen do dvou, kde se někdy i nic nenachází. Proto hra vypadá dost nedodělaně

Gameplay 5/10 - Hra má alespoň trochu zábavný bojový systém, ale u hádanek někdy blbnou věci třeba když něco chcete přetáhnout tak to nejde atd... Ale to bych asi přiřadil k tomu špatnému portu.

Příběh 7/10 - Je to klasický Silent hill příběh o tom že se vracíte domů a začínáte si vzpomínat co se vlastně stalo.

AI 6/10 - Postavy nejsou moc chytré a jsou to dost blbci.

The game itself is rather clunky, which is honestly to be expected of a Silent Hill entry, as the traversal nor combat are ever the main focus. Silent Hill is meant to be digested as a both, horrific yet cultish-ly-whimsical experience. Admittedly, this entry is one of the more gory, more slasher-esq entries, sparing no expense by featuring some of the franchises more gruesome body horror to date. Homecoming has three rather big things going for it, two of those being its creature designs with the previously mentioned 'body horror' Homecoming is ripe with. Arguably, Homecoming has some of the best boss designs IN THE FRANCHISE.

The latter in the same vain of design being the Otherworld. It's choice of reddish/brown/orange tones paired with the heavy, grime-y, rusty industrial foundation, paired with some clever sound design tricks and the like, Homecoming's Otherworld feels much more heavy ambiance-wise, while also looking neglected yet inhabited. 

On the topic of sound design, and the final real strong-sturdy bone this game has is in its music. Akira Yamaoka is known for the kind of work he's done, and his style is virtually unmatched, even deified by some, with how it's moved not just this franchise, but franchises Yamaoka has had involvement in with his various musical arrangements. If you want it in short; Homecoming's soundtrack is immaculate. It's some of the best music in the entire franchise, with Mary Elizabeth McGlynn's vocals tying it all together to create music that's never left my mind even after a decade and some change.

What causes Homecoming to be seen as a 'black sheep' to me is its attempts to be seen as a more defined entry, rather than a spin-off, making constant nods and attempts to tie in characters from previous titles into itself, and going further by having an incredibly lackluster story. The twist is delivered like a weightless punch, and too many of the supporting cast seem to not want to take this game seriously, causing some rather stilted, nearly bordering uncanny or strange line deliveries. 

Alright, onto the actual port of the game, being what actually holds this game back on PC at least; 

It's ABYSMALLY BAD. 

I had to patch my copy of the game using a patch from 'unknownproject', which luckily makes the game playable at least, but not fully remedying it of some issues, such as textures being messed up, certain audio like voice acting to play in only one ear, and the occasional crash. This game crashed three times over the course of an almost six hour playthrough patched, I can't imagine how far you'd get un-patched. I also still kept to playing the game in 1200x800, as I feared it may be more crash happy if I pushed the resolution too far.

On the topic of ports, which is where I'll conclude my ramblings, I really hope someday they refurbish this port officially. As of writing this review on October 2nd, 2024, there is now only TWO Silent Hill entries available on Steam, the other being the remake of Silent Hill 2 set to debut days after this review. The only other 'official' entry being on GOG, being Silent Hill 4. I hope that Konami maybe tries to bring forward the ports of other Silent Hill entries, both the Team Silent and Western entries, and works with a studio that can actually get it right.

Otherwise, Silent Hill Homecoming has all kinds of lovely eye-candy and ear-candy, but feels very heavy-handed, and falls very short due to its shortcomings. Play this game on a console, it's backwards compatible via the Xbox One, and that's probably the best way to even experience the game. I dunno how this game would handle being emulated.","A black sheep in the entry of the Western Silent Hill releases. For much of the good the game does, it takes two steps back in other places.

Déjà, l'ambiance du jeu reste vraiment top. La vibe inquiétante, le design des bestioles… tout ça me plonge directement dans les souvenirs. 

Problème, l’optimisation sur PC est clairement à la ramasse. J'ai passé plus de 2h à essayer de le configurer et finalement, j'ai juste l'impression d’avoir plus galéré pour le faire tourner que d'y avoir joué. Les crashs pendant les chargements sont tellement nombreux que ça en devient juste ridicule. À chaque fois que je pensais enfin pouvoir relancer le jeu, bam, un plantage qui m’oblige à recommencer le tout. 

Si vous êtes un.e fan hardcore de la franchise et que vous tenez à l'acheter sur Steam spécifiquement, attendez les soldes, et essayez de trouver un patch, un mod, ou une boisson chaude pour pouvoir y jouer sans trop rager. Je ne recommande pas le jeu en l'état. Là j'arrive à peu près à le faire tourner, mais les crash sont réguliers. 

Update après 7h de jeu : Mon cerveau avait oublié les phases de combat de Silent Hill: Homecoming, et j'avais aussi oublié que le couteau reste la meilleure arme du début à la fin. (Le système de visée des armes à distance n'est pas efficace, et les autres armes de mêlée ""lourdes"" sont trop lentes pour les ennemis. Spammer avec le couteau permettra d'interrompre la plupart des adversaires). Les QTE marchent une fois sur deux, et le bouton d'esquive ne sert à rien puisqu'on se prend toujours les attaques. Il vaut mieux sortir du mode ""combat"", et courir ""normalement"" pour échapper aux attaques ennemis. 

Le problème que j'ai avec ce jeu c'est que je peux voir toutes les idées des dévs qui ont tirés ce jeu dans plein de directions différentes (et parfois des bonnes idées en plus, j'adore vraiment le design des monstres, et l'OST est, une fois encore un putain de banger) - mais malheureusement le produit final ressemble, pour moi, au Tupperware dans le frigo où il faut mélanger tous les restes, et où le résultat final n'est vraiment pas ouf et a un goût bizarre.",

However, for $40 this game is not worth a fraction of the price on Steam. The PC port for this game makes me more nervous about the game crashing than a monster being around the corner. If you try to alt tab out of the game and back in, the game will always crash. But that wasn't a big deal because I just knew not to do that, but if you get random popups from your computer, this will also make it crash. FPS is always at 30, but constantly drops to 1 FPS at random times and every time you click the save icon. Sometimes, when this happens the game just quits itself and you will lose 30 or so minutes of game play. The fighting mechanics arn't the best, and I got soft locked on the 3rd boss because I got pinned to the wall and no matter which way I dodged, it just hit me until I died. Many times I would just need to take a break from the game because I couldn't deal with all the bugs and still enjoy myself. 

The story is not as bad as people have made it out to be, and it did have a twist, although predictable. I liked the connections to the original games, there are many endings to get (although limited choices and not all endings are great) and although I saw many people say it didn't feel like Silent Hill due to there being so many side characters, I don't agree with that. The side characters were only for small sections and didn't really say too much, and the majority of the game play was Alex by himself (I would say that Silent Hill 2 had similar amounts of side characters although they weren't revolved around the main character like Homecoming). 

Overall, if you just want to experience every Silent Hill game, then sure play it and have fun. But if you are looking for a cool game to play and don't like the series enough to be dealing with all of the issues and annoying moments the game carries, then don't waste $40.

This game has been broken since release and will never be fixed, I was also unable to get a refund as I bought it on disk in store but then linked it to my Steam account, bad idea.

My history says I have played 18 hours, but this is only since game time was being recorded. I bought the game on release and never been able to play it all the way through, most of this time is trying to play it after an upgrade, often starting from scratch.

I have experienced all of these bugs on every machine I have tried to play it on, and on Windows XP,. 7, 10 and 11. In the interest of fairness, the only CPUs I have tried to run it on are a Pentium 4, and the rest are AMD (Athlon, AthlonX4, Gen 1 Ryzen 7, Gen 3 Ryzen 5, Gen 5 Ryzen 9).

""Minor"" inconveniences :
- keyboard mapping is not persisted between save points
- gamepad mapping is not saved/used in any capacity
- all mappings will often reset themselves without reason or warning
- sound often does not work as expected, or at all
Game breaking bugs:
- there are frequent load screen crashes throughout the game
- I cannot get past the Shepherd house as the loading screen crash is consistent, this is common
- new ones after applying unknownprojects patches, it is still better than unpatched:
  - wire mesh for level visible from certain points in Nightmare
  - Using numpad 6 for straif right in config seems to be ignored (I'm left handed)
  - pushing 1 CPU core to 100% and framerate frequently dropping to ~7FPS for some reason. Running a 5950X and an RTX3060 that plays cyberpunk like butter
This game is still worth playing and I do enjoy it on other platforms, and it has some of the best death scenes ever, DO NOT BUY IT ON PC, look for an Xbox360 or PS3 version if you can.","*** DO NOT BUY IT ON PC ***

[h2] Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5) [/h2]



""Silent Hill: Homecoming"" is an atmospheric masterpiece that successfully captures the essence of what makes the Silent Hill franchise so compelling. From the moment I stepped into the fog-laden streets of Shepherd's Glen, I was greeted with a chilling sense of nostalgia. The game expertly blends haunting environments with a gripping narrative that kept me engaged until the very last moment.

The graphics are stunning for its time, with disturbing yet beautiful design choices that bring the town’s eerie ambiance to life. The character designs, especially the terrifying creatures, are both inspiring and unsettling. Every monster tells a story, adding layers to the unsettling atmosphere that the series is known for.

The gameplay mechanics are well-balanced, providing a satisfying mix of exploration, combat, and puzzle-solving. The combat system is more fluid than in previous entries, and I found myself enjoying the adrenaline rush of facing off against nightmarish foes. The puzzles are challenging but fair, requiring thought without becoming frustrating.

What truly stands out, however, is the narrative. The story dives deep into themes of guilt, trauma, and the search for redemption. The character of Alex Shepherd is relatable and deeply flawed, and watching his journey unfold was both heartbreaking and captivating.

Additionally, the soundtrack perfectly complements the haunting visuals, drawing players deeper into the experience. Akira Yamaoka's score is as memorable as ever, evoking a sense of dread and urgency throughout the game.

While it might not be everyone's favorite in the series, ""Silent Hill: Homecoming"" stands as a worthy entry that deserves recognition. Whether you're a long-time fan of the franchise or new to the series, this game provides a thrilling ride that will resonate with those who enjoy a deep, immersive horror experience.

In conclusion, if you're looking for a game that combines psychological horror with an engaging story and atmospheric gameplay, look no further than ""Silent Hill: Homecoming."" It's a journey that will leave you pondering long after the credits roll.

A lot of things that make the game vomit-inducing and a MASSIVE chore to play. 

The only reason I persisted is because I always wanted to play a SH game and I genuinely love the music of SH (helps me sleep!) and its universe but damn this game has left a foul taste in my mouth as if I ate out Pyramid Head's ass. 

The game was a very generous OK up to the point where the game starts dishing out puzzle after puzzle after goddamned puzzle as if there wasn't already enough of that shit already... I spent hours trying to solve one glitched puzzle (apparently a well known issue with the clock puzzle) before finally downloading a save file for just after that so I could move on. At many points I was just ready to give up but in a masochistic sort of way I was enjoying it. 

The game is also extremely stingy with save points, ammo and health - it makes the game even more stressful because you just never know if the game is going to crash and make you do everything all over again. A lot of enemies require distance between you and them - so where's my fucking ammo, bitch? Health is actually a little more manageable if you're careful but still.  

Honestly, the game just started to drag in the last half of the game and all of this combined with yet again more puzzles and more annoying enemies (more than you've encountered elsewhere) and a difficult boss is what finally broke this camel's back!

Did I mention that the combat fucking blows? Even the first RE game wasn't this bad and I think that game actually worked too. I've played my fair share of older titles but this takes the complete and utter piss; it's not even worth the hassle of trying to fix either, unlike a lot of older titles. Mediocrity made manifest.  

The only redeeming quality is that it's Silent Hill - the vibes are all there with the music, setting, gritty graphics and atmosphere. But that's it. Everything else is shit. It looks like shit, runs like shit and overall, it's just shit. 

Unless you're a massive fan of the series then I would say steer well clear of this piece of crap because more than likely you're going to be left sorely disappointed one way or another.

It has basically no GFX options and fullscreen can only be turned off via a config file. The game's locked to 30fps with no proper XB prompts. It also crashed a couple of times during startup.

So basically you can choose between 30fps with no proper icons or it just outright crashing with the community patch, which has no real install instructions either and you gotta piece things together yourself by looking for info online (not even PCGW has the proper instructions, lol).
Horrible port that'll never get fixed officially, because Konami doesn't care about a 15 year old game.","Horrible port.

i dont want to oversell it (and you Do have a helpful and affable black guy cop buddy for several parts of the game), but what all this means in sum is that, in some universe, there is a version of homecoming that i am stubbornly contrarian about. it wouldnt be the first unintuitive unpolished unfun game i rly enjoyed! i proved myself able to deal with the awful animations that make it unclear where your invincibility frames are, or make it needlessly difficult to anticipate attacks on even basic enemies. i was able to deal with the dodge u seemingly have no control over the direction of, with the million ways to be stunlocked into oblivion, with the lack of a run button. i was able to deal with the fact that all my most consistent strategies (stunlocking with the lightning-fast starter knife and maneuvering to behind) totally destroy the vision for dodge and parry one on one duels. after a while, i was even able to deal with the knock-off resident evil 4 controls, which have neither the utility (no quick turn button???) nor the genuine weight and texture that came with the restrictions

half of the issue is that All of this moment to moment bullshit comes from a deeply condescending need to not merely change silent hill but ""fix"" it for a mainstream audience circa 2008, ofc. but what's really unforgivable for me is that while it is condescending to the previous games, it is also crassly cannibalizing them...just a totally noxious, rotten-to-the-core bit of artistic chemical reaction that absolutely nothing could recover from. its alessa's otherworld, it's james' faceless sexy nurses, its something that looks vaguely like the closer from sh3, its fucking pyramid head

u ever think about how literally all four team silent games have nurse enemies. u ever think about how different they are, how they were all approached from the ground up to fit their respective otherworlds and accompanying characters. somehow, with core ideas as malleable and creatively stimulating as silent hill's, team silent are thus far in the series still the *only* ones to actually take advantage of that fact. i dont know where blind copying out of creative laziness ends, where genuine reverence and unproductive fandom begins, or where corporate mandates from konami fit in the middle...but the end result is a game that is totally unable to express even its good ideas artistically...a total lack of aesthetic and emotional interest or cohesion

a story with some compelling ideas, a few cool boss designs, and a few good tracks from a very checked-out yamaoka is not enough to achieve anything close to the totally singular objects that are the team silent entires, especially when its drowning in a sea where the silent hill cliches are only outnumbered by the Video Games Circa 2008 cliches. past the conception stage it feels like every single creative decision was made on the path of least resistance, so little effort or discipline, so uninvolving even at its most inherently evocative. if i still dont totally hate the game, i dont wish to give it enough of a pass that would imply this shit is okay even for a standalone game, much less something riding on the coat tails of artistic giants. the type of suffocating myopicness that makes the whole world feel a little smaller for its existence.

A história em si é muito boa (gosto pessoal), tem suas reviravoltas e o final é bem surpreendente. Pela história vale a pena.

Ambientação, cenários, trilha sonora são pontos altos do game, tá bem caprichado.

Diferente de outros jogos os monstros não tem significados, não tem a ver com os traumas ou a personalidade do protagonista, só foram jogados aleatoriamente. (Ponto baixo, vacilaram)

Agora a parte que merece realmente atenção. O JOGO POSSUI MUITOS PROBLEMAS TÉCNICOS!

Não possui legenda em português (em 2008 nem GTA vinha legendado, mas vale a pena ressaltar esse ponto)

O jogo não reconhece nenhum controle mais novo que o controle do Xbox 360 e sinceramente eu acredito que só tenha suporte para o controle do 360 mesmo. Se quiser jogar no controle vai precisar fazer umas maracutaias pra emular o controle do 360 pro jogo reconhecer os comandos. Então esteja preparado para jogar no teclado e mouse sim ou sim. 

Por mais que o jogo permita ser jogado em resolução até 4K, se você selecionar qualquer resolução acima de 1600x900 vai perceber um problema. Acima dessa resolução você não consegue visualizar o mapa ou itens coletados no cenário porque é como se os itens vazassem da tela, o que não faz sentido já que todo o resto do jogo funciona normalmente em uma resolução normal.

Não importa sua config, você vai ter problemas com quedas de fps em alguns momentos, principalmente quando de fato você entra na cidade de Silent Hill.

Ao mudar de cenário, entrar ou sair de algum lugar vai sempre aparecer uma tela de loading que de certa forma é demoradinha e quebra o ritmo do jogo.

Não se surpreenda se do nada o jogo simplesmente fechar sozinho, esse problema acontece às vezes durante o gameplay.


Prós: História, cenários, ambientação e trilha sonora.
Contras: Inúmeros problemas técnicos que atrapalham muito a jogatina, não oferecer suporte à maioria dos controles ou não consertar um erro que não permite a visualização de certos itens no inventário quando se joga em uma resolução muito alta é o cúmulo da preguiça... mas esperar o que da Konami não é mesmo?

Vale a pena? Pelo preço e pela história talvez. Dependendo da promoção o jogo fica quase de graça, mas se atentem à esses problemas antes de comprar.",

En esa época los juegos de Pc venían terriblemente porteados a PC. Si lo compran instalen el parche de unknown project. Me lo acabo de pasar a 60fps con las animaciones corregidas a 1440p con Dldsr lo cuál hace que las texturas luzcan muy bien. Tuve un crasheo al inicio y otro a la mitad del juego, de ahí en fuera el juego me fue perfecto. No es el mejor Silnet hill, de hecho es de los peores pero en mi opinión es un buen juego y dadas las circunstancias de Konami por esos días creo que DH hizo su mayor esfuerzo. 

Pros: Música, ambientación, historia (aunque no canónica) los diseños de los jefes son GOD
Contras: Gameplay acartonado, los puzzles terribles, las cinemáticas y cambios de cámara se sienten baratos.

Apesar de o que mais ter aqui é crítica, eu ainda estou recomendando o jogo, apesar dos problemas que ele tem, ainda tive uma experiência positiva, mas mais pela estética, puzzles que o jogo trás. Gosto muito da ambiência de Silent Hill, aquele vazio com neblina é impossível dar errado, os puzzles que são a parte chave do jogo foram até que interessantes, senti falta da escolha de dificuldade que é a marca do jogo... teve poucos puzzles também, mas os que tem são bem difíceis por envolver interpretação, o clássico puzzle poético... O combate funciona, senti raiva algumas vezes mas acho que é mais pela incompetência minha do que injustiça, mas é muito difícil terminar uma batalha sem pelo menos tomar uma porrada, mas enfim...
Partindo pra parte negativa, o port do jogo é >TENEBROSO< começando pela otimização, MESMO usando fix pra consertar os problemas, ainda tive bastante problema de performance, em uma das jogatinas, depois de ficar mais de 1 hora jogando, simplesmente o jogo derreteu e fiquei jogando com 15 FPS constantes e foi um sofrimento até achar um save e reabrir o jogo. Falando em reabrir, não poder dar ALT + TAB é horrível, de o jogo crashar instantaneamente, isso me deu raiva algumas vezes por acabar esquecendo disso. Muitos problemas com compatibilidade com controle, não cheguei a jogar no teclado e mouse, mas acredito que deve ser quebrado tanto quanto.. Agora partindo pro principal problema que afeta diretamente a imersão do jogo: o som.. É simplesmente quebrado, funcionando só de um lado, a voz dos personagens sendo menor que a música ou som ambiente, muitas vezes ficando totalmente abafado não dando pra ouvir ou as vezes até doendo a audição de tão distorcido e ruim que ficava o áudio, isso me deixou muito decepcionado, estragou MUITO minha experiência com o jogo, pois eu era obrigado a deixar o áudio MONO pra conseguir ficar decente.. e mesmo assim  tirando imersão pelo problema do som abafado, agudo estourado...
Apesar de todos esses problemas, foi legal revisitar um jogo que eu amava tanto quando menor, mesmo que só assistindo meu pai jogando. Se você tem paciência, de ir atrás dos fixes, configurar etc etc só pra tentar ter uma experiência ok do jogo, posso recomendar, se não, não vale seu esforço por algo tão quebrado, ao invés disso, posso 100% recomendar quem tiver o próprio XBOX 360, pois jogar pelo PC é complicado..",

Apparently a slightly different angle to a lock-on camera, a slight dodge to the side, and manually aiming your gun is tantamount to being a DMC clone? I guess?

Homecoming is a perfectly solid game in terms of design and writing. Double Helix was made up of people who knew how to do good melee combat that still has bite. And that's the thing - unlike prior Silent Hill games, running is a bit riskier. You can't just moonwalk your way through this. The enemies are harrowing. Resources are scarce, especially if you ignore side puzzles. The puzzles themselves are great, particularly the House setpiece towards the midpoint of the game.

As for the story, you want the quick and dirty version? [spoiler] You're not actually a soldier! You're heavily implied to be an adult with arrested development running around in his father's uniform. The spirit of your brother is vengeful and wants payback for what happened to him and his fellow kids sacrificed by your parents' cult. Your bro appears as the Pyramid Head in this game. It's not the same PH from Silent Hill 2. The entire game is about choosing whether you'll follow him in being wrathful or be merciful.

The real issue is that the PC/360 versions, which are the ones readily available, have the most bugs. If you can track down a physical PS3 copy, it's worth it. At least the Xbox backwards compatible version will have a much higher resolution than Homecoming likes to run at on PC.

Just like most of the Silent Hill sequels after Team Silent, it's not that it's a bad game. There is a nigh-impossible to please fanbase that just wanted the high of Silent Hill 2 again so bad that they got their wish with the Silent Hill 2 Remake... which has a lot of design decisions in common with Homecoming.

[h1]Un secreto familiar[/h1]
Alex Shepherd acaba de volver a casa tras pasar un tiempo en un campamento militar, pero el deteriorado estado en el que encuentra su pueblo no es más que la punta del iceberg. Y es que [i]Shepherd’s Glen[/i] esconde un oscuro secreto que empieza a salir a la luz. Aunque el ritmo de desarrollo no es el más acertado, la trama es más interesante de lo que creía, con algunos personajes convincentes y ciertas elecciones durante su transcurso que alteran el final.

Siguiendo la estela de anteriores entregas, se trata de un juego de terror y supervivencia en tercera persona, con cierto hincapié en la exploración y puzles. Lo que sí es distinto es la linealidad con la que está concebido. En los anteriores había muchas salas y pasillos por los que moverte, haciéndolo confuso y necesitando consultar el mapa con bastante frecuencia. En este encontraremos la mayoría de caminos cortados con excepción de aquel que debemos seguir para avanzar en la trama. Los puzles son sencillos en general, excepto el del desván, que es de un tipo de puzle que detesto. Y, como víctima de la época, la presencia de QTE ([i]Quick Time Events[/i]) es más molesta que otra cosa.

La exploración cobra importancia a la hora de encontrar objetos curativos y munición para sobrevivir. Bebidas saludables serán los más comunes, que regeneran la mitad de la vida, y los botiquines, que curan toda la barra de vida. Existe un tercer tipo, los sueros, que además de curar toda la vida la aumenta un poco de manera permanente. Dibujos y fotografías son los coleccionables opcionales del juego. Y si estamos atentos podremos encontrar una mejora para cada tipo de arma.

Han intentado hacer el combate un poco más complejo que en anteriores entregas, con aquello de la experiencia militar del protagonista, pero el resultado no es tan bueno como debería. Podemos fijar la cámara en un enemigo, esquivar, contraatacar y tenemos acceso un simple sistema de combos alternando entre ataque rápido y fuerte. Lo malo es lo tosco de los movimientos y el sistema de colisiones, en especial la de un ataque enemigo y nuestro esquive. Al menos es funcional. Además de acceso a armas cuerpo a cuerpo, también contaremos con armas de fuego, que pese a su escasa munición cobran mucha importancia en los puntos más difíciles de la aventura.

Existen dos dificultades: media y alta. En alta los enemigos hacen más daño, encontraremos menos munición y los objetos curativos sanan la mitad. El juego no tiene compatibilidad con mando pese a ser un port de consola, pero sí funciona. Eso sí, los botones que muestra son poco precisos, con números en lugar de colores y en ocasiones falla a la hora de mostrar qué pulsar. El control con teclado y ratón me parece bastante bueno, posiblemente mejor que con mando.

La ambientación con la que cuenta el juego, el modelado de los personajes y el diseño de los jefes y enemigos (algunos basados en la película de 2006) son bastante acertados, pero la baja resolución de las texturas y los escenarios poco detallados, dañan la apariencia general del título. El audio no está mal, exceptuando cierto detalle que comentaré un poco más adelante. Por otro lado, la banda sonora, nuevamente en manos de Akira Yamaoka, es extraña y buena a la vez (lo habitual en la saga). El juego viene con voces en inglés y textos en español, aunque la traducción no es ninguna maravilla, con muchas frases traducidas de manera demasiado literal que no quedan bien.

La historia debería durar unas 10 horas. Dependiendo de nuestras decisiones en tres puntos concretos tendremos acceso a cinco finales distintos. Estos finales no son pequeñas variaciones, son muy diferentes unos de otros. Una vez terminado se desbloquean trajes y armas para futuras partidas en función del tipo de final obtenido.

En cuanto al estado técnico y estabilidad del título, es terrible. Independientemente de lo que marquemos en las opciones, el juego sólo funciona a 30 FPS. Sólo soporta audio 5.1 con lo que si no dispones de dicha configuración, durante las conversaciones el audio sonara únicamente por un altavoz, junto con otros detalles. Los QTE no funcionan como deberían. Es muy posible que el juego te eche al escritorio en el momento más inoportuno. Y más. Un port sorprendentemente flojo. Por suerte, existe un parche hecho por el usuario Unknownproject que soluciona la mayoría de problemas. Aun así, no es definitivo y cuanto más avanzaba más problemas aparecían, en especial las salidas al escritorio y pantallas de carga cada vez más largas.

[b]Silent Hill: Homecoming[/b] no es mal juego y, aunque le cuesta arrancar, cuenta con una historia bastante interesante y un buen diseño de enemigos en general. Pero existe bastante margen de mejora en muchos de sus aspectos, y el estado en el que recibimos este port desequilibra la balanza en su contra de manera irredimible.",

Pros:
[list]
[*]Akira Yamaoka does good work again, although whether or not the track used fits the situation is entirely a coinflip.
[*]Some neat visual effects (though they were mostly ripped from the movie)
[*]There's a few neat enemy designs.
[/list]
Cons:
[list]
[*] More crashes than the opening of Final Destination 2. Played through the same sequence on five occasions in the span of an hour and because of crashing continuously lost progress. Savepoints are few and far between because it's a survival-horror, but because the conditions of the port are more horrific than anything found in Silent Hill, it's very possible you could get soft-locked because the game just decides to crash before you can find a point to save. There's a file somewhere down in the reviews to patch it and stabilize it, apparently.
[*] Despite it initially releasing on the Xbox 360 and PS3 in 2008, there is no controller support unless you find a custom file to force it to work on a controller.
[*] Lots of garbage enemy designs. Cool names, but there's probably four or five good designs, and two of them aren't even original to this game. 
[*] Game is definitely from 2008 with all of the Q.T.E.s. Click multiple times to chop down boards in a cutscene when it could have been one-and-done. Rapid Click to pull your hand free from a cutscene wall. And sometimes you'll be given a prompt for the Q.T.E. and it won't matter anyways, you were at low enough health that you still die even though the prompt was there, but your health doesn't go down gradually, just upon impact or death.
[*] Pacing is awful. Stop a heart-pounding cutscene and sequence to tell you that you got a new item. Exit one cutscene, be stuck in a single spot pacing back and forth unable to actually do anything until the next designated cutscene pops in.
[*] The combat. This combat is bad. And not bad like how Silent Hill should be. The game flip-flops between wanting to show off its horrid combat system and remembering that Survival Horror wants players to flee from encounters. Enemy placements are ridiculous; at some points you'll be placed with one enemy in a wide open space and you can easily dodge it, which is fine, but other times there are so many aggressive enemies placed in one tight corridor or around the corner without being warned via The Radio Static (Police Station pops to mind) that you'll end up running into a mass of four enemies that all charge, and you'll just never be able to hit the right one or find a way out. This only serves as a frustration rather than a genuinely scary situation 90% of the time. You can only fight in your combat stance, requiring you to toggle it on and target the nearest hostile, except there's a good chance you'll target another guy farther away and try to hit him with your Super Weapon Combos, letting the closest thing skewer you in the process of hitting the wall conveniently  between you and your Silent-Hill-Homecoming-Combat-Designated-Target. 
[*] Game crashed again while I was writing this. There's only so many times I can handle ""load, wait for NPC, cutscene, run sequence, cutscene, get your items back from the police chief's office, cutscene, spawn 5 schisms in a corridor, die, gamecrash"" before I just call it quits for the evening. 

 I haven't tried the community patch that allegedly fixes the crashing, but even with the patch I can't recommend paying $40 for this sad excuse of a port. If you find it on sale for $20 or less, then sure, grab it and grab the patch and play a mid action-horror game. Otherwise just skip it entirely and just watch a playthrough of it.","Probably the most shameful legitimate video game I've played on here. Charging $40 for a broken port of one of the worst Silent Hill games is laughable. I honestly wouldn't even advise buying it when it's on sale unless it's something like $5.
Pros:
[list]
[*]Akira Yamaoka does good work again, although whether or not the track used fits the situation is entirely a coinflip.
[*]Some neat visual effects (though they were mostly ripped from the movie)
[*]There's a few neat enemy designs.
[/list]
Cons:
[list]
[*] More crashes than the opening of Final Destination 2. Played through the same sequence on five occasions in the span of an hour and because of crashing continuously lost progress. Savepoints are few and far between because it's a survival-horror, but because the conditions of the port are more horrific than anything found in Silent Hill, it's very possible you could get soft-locked because the game just decides to crash before you can find a point to save. There's a file somewhere down in the reviews to patch it and stabilize it, apparently.
[*] Despite it initially releasing on the Xbox 360 and PS3 in 2008, there is no controller support unless you find a custom file to force it to work on a controller.
[*] Lots of garbage enemy designs. Cool names, but there's probably four or five good designs, and two of them aren't even original to this game. 
[*] Game is definitely from 2008 with all of the Q.T.E.s. Click multiple times to chop down boards in a cutscene when it could have been one-and-done. Rapid Click to pull your hand free from a cutscene wall.

Este game até parece ser divertido, porém o jogo trava ou fecha sozinho toda hora, você faz um progresso bom no game, daqui a pouco perde tudo porque o jogo simplesmente fecha, estou desistindo de jogar já, porque assim é muito desmotivante. 

Eu acho que este game esta muito datado, envelheceu muito mal, mesmo sendo um game ai do final de 2008, parece ser um jogo mais antigo, não suporta nativamente o controle do Xbox. 

Outro ponto muito negativo do game é que ele é travado a 30fps, e mesmo editando o arquivo que o pessoal na internet diz para editar, o ""vars_pc.cfg"" o game não respeita a configuração que esta ali e simplesmente roda a 30fps, até existe um patch / mod que vi pela net que da para instalar, mas eu não quis arriscar baixar e testar softwares desconhecidos que possam conter códigos maliciosos.

Além do game estar a 30 fps, ele ainda é meio ""descompassado"" da impressão de estar rodando com framerate variando, não sei se isso é mais uma das incompatibilidades do game, já que meu monitor é de 165hz. 

Estou rodando o game em um Avell com uma RTX 3060 6GB , Core I7 11800H, 32GB RAM, 2TB SSD, monitor ASUS FullHD 165Hz G-Sync compatível.

Infelizmente, apesar de ter zerado o Silent Hill 2 e 3 pela primeira vez este ano de 2024 pelo Xbox SX (versão HD Collection) não terei como zerar este game porque esta ""injogável"" no PC e no Xbox não existe para venda!
Konami, empresa sem responsabilidade nenhuma com o cliente para deixar uma versão tão problemática assim a venda, acho que este game deveria ser banido da loja!

It's actually insane how this game is available on Steam and it's the only SH game here. The vanilla version runs at 30fps, has broken qte's, crashes a lot, it makes an already poorly made game even worse. I installed a patch that fixed those issues for the most part, I probably wouldn't have finished it if not for that.
The game's story is meh, it could be better but it's also not the worst thing in the world. The main character isn't very interesting but he could've been worse, it's the same thing with side characters. I also can't believe they used Pyramid Head in this for like 3/4 scenes, it's hilariously bad. The voice acting and sound design is mostly bad, with sound effects often just not playing.
The atmosphere is nice during a few sections but it's mostly lacking.
The combat system here is kinda bad, it's not that responsive and sometimes your attacks don't even affect an enemy when it should. It's pretty barebones but it's an interesting change from previous titles, just not a very good one. The game also makes you fight some enemies or you'll have a hard time exploring some sections so that makes you get even more bored of the combat and the way it works.
The enemies are a very mixed bag, some have interesting designs (specially bosses) but they're mostly a chore to fight against.
Overall, it's not a good SH game. As a horror game, it's playable (with a patch) but you'd be better off with pretty much any other horror game.","4.5/10

-la historia: digamos que es un plagio pero mal hecho y flojo del 2, se me hizo bastante predecible y no es tan llamativa pero esta bien, es un 6, nada del otro mundo.

-Graficos: Aun se mantienen hasta del dia de hoy, son decentes y no son tan brutales pero para fecha de salida, envecio bastante bien. 7

-jugabilidad: es facil de entender, el problema son sus mecanicas, es como un re 4 pero mal hecho, el sistema de esquive es tosco, los enemigos te pegan enfermos y aveces cuesta esquivarlos, tambien hubo ciertos momentos donde no podia sacar el arma, por que estaba bugeado, quitando eso, cuando entendes lo basico es entretenido. 7 

-Mapeado: Me parecio muy bien hechas las zonas del mapa, la ambientacion es buenisima. 8/10

-Musica: buenisima, un 8. 

-monstruos: la verdad, no hay mucho que decir, los diseños estan god, son incomodos de mirar (salvo las enfermeras) llega a dar mucha incomodidad cuando te toman por sorpresa pero en general son un 8 (Algunos parecen reciclados pero con un ligero retoque).

-Bosses: me gustaron todos, muy buenas mecanicas y diseños, lastima que son poquitos, le doy un 8.5

Rejugabilidad: si queres sacar logros, o probar trajes y armas que se desbloquean, es bastante genial, incluso podes subirle la dificultad si te consideras bastante bueno, aunque no recomiendo sino queres ser oneshoteado por cada cosa que te cruces. eso ya es opcional, en mi caso, con una vez me basto. tengo muchos juegos pendientes. 

por ultimo, los finales, son bastante meh la verdad, a expcion de ALERTA DE SPOILER .. 


el del verdugo y el final bueno, yo me saque el final UFO a la primera y me cague de risa. 


NOTA FINAL: No es un mal Juego, lo que resta muchos puntos es que esta mal porteado y su historia algo predecible, por todo lo demas es bastante disfrutable, buen silent, aunque no llega a ser God como la trilogia original. Un lujo haberlo terminado, me gusto el juego Y si te gusta algo de accion y la exploracion te lo recomiendo,. no puedo recomendar el titulo a aquellos que busquen solo terror y historia por que este titulo no ofrece lo que buscas. es una experiencia para otro tipo de jugadores mas añejos.

[i] Obviamente no es el mejor silent hill pero cumple lo suyo es divertido, y el combate es mejor que otros juegos de la misma franquicia, la historia ira de ir a buscar a tu hermano con bastantes escenas que te van dando pistas de lo que esta pasando con muchos finales por descubrir, juego muy corto unas 5 horas, 4 jefes disfrutables pero muy fáciles y nada memorables, el final que saque es donde se van en un OVNI , muy a lo suyo, aun con todo lo bueno y lo malo sin duda no deberías perdértelo.

[i] Aunque el juego sea bueno, hasta el momento de hoy, solo este juego de la saga es posible comprarlo en steam y el port es lamentable, enserio no exagero crasheos, bugs visuales, los controles, bloqueado a 30 fps. no soporta resoluciones altas , ya se imaginaran un port sin ganas.
Por suerte esto es PC y existe un chico que hizo un mod para arreglar esto, aunque con el mod puesto, arregla todo menos los crasheos constantes. así que ten en cuenta que te crasheara el juego mínimo una vez. si no quieres batallar con todo esto juega la versión de consola y evitate todo esto.

Hay un fix de esto, pero yo no me calenté mucho la cabeza con programas y cosas externas y puse el sonido de windows en ''mono''. A veces este juego se cuelga. Recomendable que lo juegues a 30fps (como te viene de base sin modificar) porque te da menos errores. Que piramid head esté en este juego es una tremenda fumada sin sentido (fanservice) el combate no me gustó mucho, pero tampoco me quejo. No hay mucha variedad de enemigos. En general no está a la par de las 4 primeras entregas, pero eso lo sabes tu y yo sin necesidad de jugar este título. 
Con tantas cosas negativas. ¿Por qué lo recomiendo?. La trama está entretenida, hay diseños de enemigos que son turbios y molan. Me gusta mucho Silent Hill. Legalmente solo puedes jugar en PC al SH4 (JUEGAZO) y a este.

Review:
Dude, totally into the whole series vibe, but gotta admit, this game's been a rollercoaster of suffering for me, especially with the hardcore mode. Like, there are these enemies you just can't even touch, and they gang up on you. Heads up, gameplay's kinda meh, feels like stumbling into a Dark Souls without the whole attack pattern thing, The Needler and the Schism can shove a metal pipe up their ass.

Honestly, if you wanna enjoy the story, better off watching a gameplay vid cuz it doesn't really add much to the Silent Hill lore, aside from a couple of endings.","<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<[REVIEW BELOW THE OVERALL]>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

It does that weird thing American horror games do where when a new monster shows up it grabs the camera, some stage lights make all the blood, spit, and leather/plastic/metal on it sparkle, and the monster does a little tap dance just to make sure you get to see all the work the character modelers did despite the fact that whatever Freudian mess the design team thinks is scary is way less scary than battling your own instinct to want to know what the hell that thing you sort of see in the darkness is and not wanting to find out if it can murder you.

Overall not horrible, but also I wouldn't consider it worth the time to play.

My friend helped me figure out how to make this work!!?!?!  It still crashes occasionally and has its bugs, but I am now halfway through the game!

First of all, it helps tremendously to change the display resolution to 1280x720.  Then we used DXWnd to make it run in its own modal, fixed-ratio window.

And that was it!!  Like I said, still a bit touchy... but totally plays!!!  Will update my review later with whether or not I actually would recommend this game.  So far it's still a 'no', but I'm not hating it that much (otherwise I just wouldn't play it lol).

What, those words aren't enough to convince you this is the weakest of the main entries?

Well, I guess I'll elaborate.
Homecoming, in contrast to its four predecessors and Origins, is a linear experience: It focuses on combat with some light puzzle solving, and the combat owes more to Condemned: Criminal Origins than it does Silent Hill: Combos like ""Light-Light-Strong"" and ""Strong-light"" rule the melee space, and firearms are literally overpowered, the handgun killing enemies in two shots if you aim properly. Making things worse is that unlike in Condemned, ammo drops are as present as any other main Silent Hill game (albeit reduced to the power of a gun this time) This means the game utterly fails as a Silent Hill game despite it sharing DNA with what came before. And further more, the nickname of ""Silent Hill: The Movie: The Game"" is well earned: This game owes far more to Chris Gans' loose adaptation than the series prior. The Nurses and The Boogeyman (Pyramid Head) all return in their appearances from that movie, the Smog is LITERALLY a redesigned version of the film version of the Lying Figure from 2, and the game lacks the brand of subtlety from the series prior much like that film. Because of this, Silent Hill: Homecoming feels like a very blatant attempt by Konami to ride the coattails of Capcom's success with Resident Evil 4, and the results are... flawed.

So... Why do I find this game to be overhated despite also being the weakest one?
Don't get me wrong: It's flawed, the PC port is inert without the UnknownProject patch, and all the reasons above. But Homecoming is still a damn fine outing in its own right: The controls feel fine, the combat mostly clicks (ESPECIALLY ranged due to the guns being OP), monster designs are pretty fun, and the atmosphere feels genuine. Scare-wise, the game is home to the best version of the iconic Otherworld, and there are a few good monsters and jumps that will catch first-time players off guard, so it does work as a horror despite the aforementioned flaws. You can tell as you play that developers The Collective were doing the best with what they were given, and it's pretty fun despite its flaws. It's honestly tied with Daikatana as the best ""bad"" game I've ever played. So if anyone is curious about Silent Hill as a franchise... Start with Silent Hill 2 with the Enhanced Edition mod. But still go ahead and buy this. You can do much worse than Homecoming when it comes to survival horror.","Silent Hill: The Movie: The Game.

Tanto a história, personagens, cenários, monstros e as musicas são muito boas. E se você for como eu que se assusta com coisas bobas... bem vindo ao barco.
Dito isso, o jogo não é perfeito, ele apresenta muitos problemas de desempenho, como lag, travamentos, lentidão e principalmente crashes, acabando muitas vezes com o ânimo e o proveito de muitos fãs do game. Problemas esses que por ser um porte é até esperado, mas vindo de uma empresa grande é um tanto desapontante se comparado com outros portes feitos por fãs que existem por aí. Um exemplo seria o porte do SH2 para PC que temos que concordar... é um bom porte. No meu PC pelo menos ele nunca crashou :D . Por fim, recomendo imensamente o game, mesmo tendo esses problemas, porque é tão bom quanto os anteriores...

I've heard that the story sucks, & that it fails to capture the spirit of Silent Hill. Well, let me tell you from a totally unbiased standpoint that this game is a perfectly good, spooky, uneasy time. Of course it isn't going to be better than the original Silent Hill, but that isn't what it needs to be. This game is spooky, mysterious, & definitely feels like a true Silent Hill title. Almost all the mechanics are still intact from the map system to the way you explore the town to the enemies. The only real impactful difference is the combat system, which I do admit is fairly clunky at times, but definitely not unplayable garbage. Now, the bugs are definitely an issue, but the game is definitely still playable. Especially for a game that didn't get a single bug patch or any post release support whatsoever. If you like Silent Hill & have been back & forth on playing this game, just remember that bugs are an issue, but as long as you save as often as you're supposed to then you will have a good, fun Silent Hill experience.

As a game that I am going through with my daughter, I think it's pretty amazing. I haven't played a silent hill game since ""The Room"". This game is scary and all, but it's a lot of puzzles that are fun to solve too. The fighting system is different than other Silent Hill games but that's ok because the main character is a soldier, so it makes sense you should be able to kick ass. Graphics are pretty good but not great. They really ""fit"" the Silent Hill graphic style, so it's kind of gritty.

The bad:
I don't like how I can accidentally progress through the game without picking up certain weapons like the Rifle. That really blows because sometimes I like to move forward in games thinking I can go back later with the missing piece to a puzzle. So I was not happy when i keep finding Rifle ammo and I never found the rifle. That might be why the game is randomly really hard sometimes, but I it's all still possible. 

The Ugly:
Daily crash or two during our gaming sessions. Sometimes, like for example, when loading the save menu, it hitches for a long time. It eventually works, but for a game that crashes so much, it is nerve wrecking because you don't know if it's a hitch or a crash. My PC doesn't crash on anything else, and I run most things on Ultra, so yeah, the code is just obviously a little unrefined to say the least. 

Sumamry:
If you like Silent Hill franchise then you have gotta play it with the caveat that you may get a crash from time to time...also make lots of saves in case you mess up and have to go back.","The good:

- Good sound design;

- Monster design (which is probably the best part of it);
- Various narrative choices;
- Really well done Otherworld and dimension switch;

- Almost no true exploration,not even in the town;
- Hitboxes and enemy stunlock attacks;
- QTEs (f*ck those ferals especially in the streets);
- Terrible performances and visuals that are partially fixed by some patches (good bless these modders).Resident Evil 2 Remake runs 10x better;
- Puzzles design (they even decided to repeat the same puzzles more than one time...);
- Animations and models that,absurdly,can't even keep up with Silent Hill 3 (a game from 2003) AT ALL;
- Stupid,not interesting and not tense fights against other humans;
- Aiming mechanics (just use the knife the entire game and you will never regret it);
- Predictable and rushed story (didn't keep me interested at all) with such an empty,full of questions and unsatisfiying ending (atleast the one I got);
- It's so bad that they didn't even translate the menus in other languages so I could not use my language or I would have missed some options;
- Too short (my total time is mostly about me trying to make it work and run decently) and don't really give you more reasons to play it;
- Many boring and kind of annoying levels;
- It still cost 19.99 with no sale.

É um jogo extremamente datado com uma jogabilidade horrível. O jogo se propõe a ser desafiador, frustrando o jogador a todo instante: os inimigos têm bastante vida e atacam muito rápido ao se aproximarem. O sistema de aparar e desviar dos golpes é sofrível; muitas vezes o personagem fica preso em um canto ou esquiva para o lado errado, recebendo dano e morrendo em momentos cruciais. Com os chefes, a esquiva é muito lenta; no caso do último chefe, por exemplo, é quase inútil. Além disso, a orientação da câmera do jogo atrapalha constantemente durante o combate, criando pontos cegos e atravessando paredes.
A história do jogo é razoável, mas não se compara com Silent Hill 1 e 2. É mais um clichê americano: cidade pequena, seita, desaparecimentos, unidos à ideia de Silent Hill. Nesse quesito, acho que Alan Wake faz um trabalho muito melhor. Na minha opinião, não vale a pena comprar. Não é canônico com os clássicos dos anos 2000 e nem tem a mesma qualidade.

Si bien Homecoming tiene sus cosas que podría decirse intenta ser un buen SIlent Hill como el diseño de sus jefes y su trasfondo, el inicio del juego que es inquietante y muy bien desarrollado, después de que pasas esto, el juego es mas plano y sin sentido que hasta da pereza, el protagonista simple, personajes secundarios para nada interesantes. La verdad que recordaba el juego mal y ahora que lo volví a rejugar pensé que el tiempo le daría algo a su favor.

La jugabilidad no es Silent Hill, quisieron aprovecharse del boom de RE4 para poder hacer su juego mas accesible y la verdad fue un error fatal, el arma mas OP de todo el juego es el cuchillo, arma que tienes desde el inicio del juego.

147237398,russian,2023.08.29 01:11,✅,✅,0.6425791383,9,"Камрад! Первое, что следует знать про Silent Hill: Homecoming — это то, что данная игра проклята. Нет, это вовсе не происки зловредных богов, а вполне конкретное разгильдяйство программистов из Double Helix. Немодифицированная (или же «ванильная») Steam-версия представляет собой слабоиграбельный, тормозящий и вылетающий кусок программного кода, способный отвратить от себя любого мало мальски уважающего себя и своё время ПК-юзера. 
Если ваша уверенность непоколебима и желание ознакомиться с SH:H всё ещё не пропало, то вот небольшой рецепт, как свести свои мучения к минимуму и хоть как-то получить от игры удовольствие:

1.	Ради Метатрона, Пирамидоголового и святой Алессы — ставь фикс на разблокировку ФПС! Просто заменить в папке «Steam/steamapps/common/Silent Hill Homecoming/Bin» один-единственный файлик и избавить себя от консольного «кинематографического опыта». Негоже это пека-боярам, негоже. Да, постоянно честные 60 кадров в секунду тут держаться не будут, нередко попадаются локации, в которых ФПС у меня опускался аж до 20 и менее. Также останутся периодические зависания на 15-30 секунд (это как-то связано с автосохранениями), но в целом, это значительно, ЗНАЧИТЕЛЬНО лучше, особенно когда дойдёт до стычек с врагами. 
2.	Установить патч на исправление некорректного позиционирования звука. Разрабы сотворили что-то непотребное, полагая, что стереосистемой 5.1 обладают абсолютно все игроки и в итоге если у вас обычное 2.0, большая часть звуков идёт только через один канал. Патч целиком не исправляет проблему, но в моём случае стало опять-таки значительно приятнее.
3.	Ещё можно поставить фикс на корректное отображение кнопок геймпада (а играть в данную игру желательно именно с ним), чтобы не путаться в QTE.
4.	Русификация опциональна, текстовый фанатский перевод пусть и не идеален, но вполне пристойного качества.

К сожалению, вылеты всё равно могут случаться, у меня они изредка бывали во время загрузок между локациями и после загрузки чекпоинтов во время битв с боссами (чтобы избежать вылета может попробовать выход в главное меню и загрузка ручного сохранения).Я прошёл игру со всеми указанные исправлениями использованы и подтверждаю удовлетворительную стабильность и работоспособность игры. Патчи взяты из раздела «Руководства» из центра сообщества игры в Steam, желающие найдут их без особого труда. Дерзайте.

Пробовал ставить большой патч от Unknownproject, объединяющий практически все эти исправления и до полицейского участка всё было отлично — ни одного зависания, частота кадров ни разу не снизилась ниже 55 и лично для меня, запомнившего её несколько иначе, игра прямо таки расцвела, раскрыв весь потенциал. Однако, стоило попасть в полицейский участок, как малине пришёл конец, когда поломавшийся скрипт поставил в моём прохождении жирную точку и братишка Уиллер упёрся в стену вместо того, чтобы открыть Шепарду дверь. Поэтому игру пришлось переустанавливать и данный патч рекомендовать не могу. 

Теперь касательно самой игры. Ранее я проходил все каноничные части Silent Hill и вот теперь я наконец одолел и Homecoming, который стал завершающим в моём списке. Понятно, конечно, почему фанаты Сайлент Хилла в своё время так негодовали и предали пятую часть анафеме, понося американских разработчиков на чём свет стоит. 
Игра американская, да. Это заметно в приёмах запугивания и структуре сюжета, который стал совершенно прямолинеен. Сама история с культом и жертвоприношениями неплоха и нормально вписывается в лор серии, но подаётся местами очень топорно. Раскрытия персонажей и глубин характеров можете не ждать.
Атмосфера подсмотрена из первой экранизации Кристофа Ганса и почти все стилистические решения взяты именно из кино: концепция незатухающих пожаров угольных шахт под городом, из-за которых постоянный смог; дизайн и поведение медсестёр; архитектура Церкви Ордена и облачения культистов и конечно же приглашённая звезда Пирамидоголовый. Я могу понять, почему так было сделано, но насчёт уместности поспорил бы.
Боёвка. Можно смело сказать, что разрабы пошли навстречу тем, кто был недоволен запиныванием врагов в Сайлент Хиллах от Team Silent. Тут боевую систему изрядно прокачали: огнестрельное оружие никуда не делось, но прицеливание осуществляется как в шутере от третьего лица (с плеча), а столкновения с врагами в ближнем бою стали напоминать чуть ли не полноценный слэшер/бит-эм-ап с комбо-связками, перекатами, уклонениями и блоками. К каждому виду врага нужно подбирать своё оружие, но в большинстве случае стартовый нож и связка «быстрый-быстрый-быстрый-сильный удар» оказывалась ультимативным средством против медсестёр (тут особенно соблазнительно пышногрудых), собак, вагинолицых и культистов. Противников редко бывает больше одного за раз, второй как правило ошивается в сторонке и по-джентельменски ждёт своей очереди озвездюлиться от Шепарда. Я сам изрядно посмеялся в начале, но к концу игры поймал себя на том, что сражаться с врагами тут, в общем-то, весело (разве что не понравилось, как персонажа магнитит к врагу) и даже не надоедает. Плохо ли это для игры, претендующей на звание survival-horror? Решайте сами.
Боссы. Одна из самых сильных сторон игры. Достаточно запоминающиеся, жуткие, стильные и требующие определённой сноровки. 
Загадки. Их оказуалили в угоду доступности, больше никакого головоломного пианино и проверки эрудиции творчеством Шекспира, большинство здешних задачек решается без особого напряжения нейронов головного мозга. Единственное, что не понравилось, так это ремонт электрощитков, где нужно тупым методом перебора подобрать правильную последовательность. Тупо, долго, неинтересно.
Музыка. Акира Ямаока и Мэри Элизабет МакГлинн на месте и вновь радуют слух прекрасными вокально-инструментальными композициями. Не являюсь меломаном и не считаю, что Ямаока после The Room исписался. Его музыка и эмбиент делают 80% фирменной неповторимой атмосферы, которая тут, пусть и в изменённом состоянии, всё же угадывается.
Графическая часть. Тут всё неоднозначно. Насколько я знаю, игра использует модифицированный движок Slayer из древней игры про Баффи. Но тут она снабжена физикой Havok и всё окружение обладает непривычной в 2023-м интерактивностью: стулья, столики и прочую мелочовку можно опрокинуть (зачем-то). В целом уровень картинки очень хорош для игры с Xbox 360 и PS3. Туман (ах да, тут это как в экранизации — смог) и городские пейзажи Шепардс-Глена и Сайлент Хилла (пусть практически неотличимых друг от друга) вполне симпатичны, а их потусторонние адские версии с оранжевым заревом, пробивающимся сквозь решётки и вентиляторы так и вовсе выглядят потрясающе и атмосферно. Ещё на врагах остаются корректные порезы в тех местах, где им был нанесён урон, такое и сейчас-то диковинка. Но вот модели персонажей… Протагонист Алекс Шепард детализирован и анимирован нормально, чего не сказать про остальных. Меньше всего повезло судье Холлоуэй, которая превзошла любые ужасы Сайлент Хилла: при первом же взгляде хочется в ужасе бежать куда подальше от этого адского отродья с неестественно гладкой, низкодетализированной физиономией, округлой кривой ухмылкой и выпученными глазами без век. 
Double Helix не самые худшие разработчики в мире, но стоило ли отдавать именно им в руки судьбу одной из культовых игровых серий? На этот вопрос мы уже не узнаем ответа.

Вердикт: Silent Hill: Homecoming — это нормальная игра, которой чертовски не повезло. Её загнобили фанаты старых частей, страдающие синдромом утёнка, её испортили сами криворукие разработчики, не сумевшие нормально оптимизировать свой продукт. В контексте всей серии её можно рассматривать как непомерное богохульство и отход от канонов, как деградацию и скатывание в бездушный конвейер. Однако, спустя 15 лет после релиза, какое это всё имеет значение? Серия Silent Hill мертва (пока что), равно как и жанр survival-horror уже давно испустил последний всхрип. Если вы истосковались по старорежимному атмосферному хоррор-экшену и не испытываете отвращения от около-слэшерной боёвки, попробуйте. Скорее всего вы не пожалеете.",

145871645,russian,2023.08.07 23:39,❌,❌,0.6677840948,14,"Многострадальнее серии чем [b]Silent Hill[/b], наверное, нет. После прекрасных первых четырех частей, созданных оригинальной командой [i]Team Silent[/i], издатель Konami Corporation принимает непонятное решение распустить студию, а бренд пустить по рукам малоизвестных студий.
Таким образом [b]Silent Hill[/b] попадает в руки к американцам из [i]Double Helix Games[/i], которые на рынке игр практически неизвестны. Тем не менее они берутся за разработку, и в 2008 году появляется неоднозначный [b]Silent Hill: Homecoming[/b].

Сюжетно игра никак не перекликается с предыдущими частями, это цельный самостоятельный проект во вселенной [b]Silent Hill[/b] с совершенно новым главным героем и второстепенными героями. История повествует о некоем Алексе Шепарде, который возвращается в свой родной город Шепардс-Глен после службы в армии и застаёт его в удручающем состоянии. Младший брат пропал, престарелая мать, похоже, сошла с ума, а отец отправился в Сайлент Хилл в поисках сына. Кроме того, в самом городе творится чёрте что: люди пропадают, кругом разруха и упадок. Естественно бывший вояка (по крайней мере он так считает) изъявляет желание во всём разобраться и, заодно, отыскать пропавшего брата.

Как видно, сюжетная завязка предельно проста и по-американски стандартна. Тоже самое и с персонажами: по сравнению с японскими они совершенно неинтересны и не харизматичны, за исключением, разве что, Кертиса Акерса — владельца свалки, который даёт Шепарду пистолет.
В предыдущих частях серии у всех персонажей имелась своя история, свои грехи и поступки, здесь же всё это либо отсутствует напрочь, либо показано слишком поверхностно. Не в последнюю очередь в этом виноваты диалоги, которые растеряли былой шарм, глубину и скрытые смыслы, чем японцы всегда славились.
То же самое произошло и с миром игры: если настоящее выполнено вполне в духе серии, то есть городки Шепардс-Глен и Сайлент Хилл выглядят как и раньше — туманными, атмосферными и неплохо проработанными, то над потусторонним миром откровенно поглумились. Запихали в игру какие-то непонятные светящиеся текстуры, снабдили странными элементами, вроде разрезающейся ножом плоти и огромных вентиляторов, а также убрали все детали. Также присутствуют странные геймдизайнерские решения, так, например, в тесной канализации расставлены остовы машин. What the fuck?

В серии [b]Silent Hill[/b] управление всегда было какое-то особенное, не всегда удобное, но со временем ставшее практически визитной карточкой игры. В [b]Silent Hill: Homecoming[/b] с этим покончили: теперь нет бешеной камеры и специфичной боевой системы, управление стало привычным и простым. Для заядлых фанатов это вряд ли плюс, а вот для новичков — несомненно.
В целом, разработчикам удалось сохранить и общую механику игры: по-прежнему исследуем город, тыкаемся в закрытые двери, решаем головоломки и применяем различные собранные предметы там, где это необходимо. Но всё это сделано как-то... бедно что ли. Не дотягивает до заданной в [i]Team Silent[/i] планки качества.
То же самое с графикой — то ли бюджет у игры был совсем мал, то ли движок такой скудный, но предыдущим частям игра проигрывает вчистую. В проекте появилась честная физика и тени, а толку? По части картинки игра не выдерживает никакой критики, и единственное, что мне в ней реально понравилось — это модели машин. Невероятно, но факт.

Также серия [b]Silent Hill[/b] всегда славилась своим бестиарием, то есть монстрами. Многие из них что-то символизировали, да и сами игры строились вокруг одного большого символизма. В этой части всё это опять же куда-то утеряно, из старых противников остались только медсёстры и пирамидоголовый, который, в общем-то, и не противник. Всех остальных противников придумали заново, и получилось это как вся остальная игра — не очень. Нет ни малейшей мотивации с ними бороться, хочется просто пробежать мимо, если это возможно. Такая же ситуация обстоит и с боссами. Они тоже не особо интересны и не западают в память, хотя и лучше чем рядовые монстры.

Совершенно очевидно, что передача серии в чужие руки сыграла с проектом злую шутку, он... просто не нужен. Лучше десятый раз перепройти какое-нибудь из творений [i]Team Silent[/i], чем раз за разом бороться с собой и играть в Сайлент Хилл, который сделан какими-то людьми по контракту и просто, чтобы было. Хотя, пройти и забыть как еще одну неудачную игру всё же можно, благо мир Сайлент Хилла не перестаёт затягивать в себя всё новых жертв.",

Inimigos excepcionais e chefes melhores ainda, definitivamente o combate é o diferencial desse game, apesar de ter quem torça o nariz para as mecânicas implementadas. O jogo vale bastante apena tendo em vista que em promoção você pode pegar ele por 3 reais.

Recomendo o jogo ""Silent Hill: Homecoming"" para os fãs de jogos de terror psicológico que buscam uma experiência imersiva e atmosférica. Com sua narrativa intrigante, elementos de horror e quebra-cabeças desafiadores, o jogo é uma ótima adição à icônica série ""Silent Hill"".

2 - Resumo completo do jogo:

""Silent Hill: Homecoming"" é o sexto título principal da série de jogos de terror ""Silent Hill"". Desenvolvido pela Double Helix Games, o jogo segue a história de Alex Shepherd, um veterano de guerra que retorna à sua cidade natal de Shepherd's Glen para encontrar seu irmão desaparecido e desvendar os mistérios sinistros que envolvem a cidade.

A jogabilidade mistura elementos de survival horror com ação, enquanto os jogadores exploram ambientes sombrios, enfrentam criaturas grotescas e resolvem quebra-cabeças complexos. A atmosfera sinistra e a trilha sonora perturbadora contribuem para a sensação de tensão constante, enquanto a narrativa mergulha nos temas do sobrenatural e da psicologia.

3 - Pontos Positivos:

Narrativa envolvente: A história intrigante e cheia de reviravoltas mantém os jogadores engajados ao longo do jogo.

Ambiente atmosférico: A cidade de Shepherd's Glen e o mundo alternativo de Silent Hill são ricamente detalhados, criando uma sensação imersiva de horror.

Quebra-cabeças desafiadores: Os quebra-cabeças são complexos e bem integrados à narrativa, exigindo raciocínio e exploração.

Design de som e trilha sonora: A trilha sonora e os efeitos sonoros contribuem significativamente para a atmosfera assustadora.

4 - Pontos Negativos:

Mecânicas de combate: As mecânicas de combate podem parecer um pouco rígidas e desajeitadas em comparação com outros jogos do gênero.

Bugs e problemas técnicos: Alguns jogadores relataram problemas técnicos, como glitches e travamentos.

Nota: 4/5

Conclusão:

""Silent Hill: Homecoming"" oferece uma experiência de terror psicológico envolvente e atmosférica, perfeita para os fãs da série e para aqueles que apreciam uma narrativa intrigante e ambientes assustadores. Embora possa apresentar algumas questões técnicas e mecânicas de combate menos refinadas, a atmosfera sinistra, a narrativa cativante e os desafios de quebra-cabeças fazem deste um título que vale a pena jogar. A nota final para ""Silent Hill: Homecoming"" é de 4/5.",

It has multiple bugs and errors like broken actions or interactions, some fights animations get stuck or enemies do not respond and there's a lot of random crashes. Sometimes NPCS get stuck and you cannot advance in the game. It took me 19h and a lot of headaches to complete 1 of the 5 different endings. If it weren't for all these reasons I would totally recommend it.

Better get it for console if you have the opportunity and the hardware. If that's not an option and you want it anyways, wait for a sale, download the patch (will find it in steam guides, thanks for making it), notepad++ and prepare yourself to edit some game files.

I suggest (this worked for me after trying multiple configurations) to patch it, to do not exceed 60fps (works better in just 30fps) set 1280x720 (720p) [change your default screen resolution to this resolution too] and windowed (not full screen). This seems to minimize crashes and bugs. Debug function for collisions worked for me one time an NPC was blocking the way. Do not use Windows compatibility options.

- ÚNICAMENTE COMPRAR EN DESCUENTO

Critica abierta:
Por que?: El juego tiene demasiados bugs, crasheos, mal producción de banda sonora haciendo que escuches mal todo el juego. Nunca se dignaron a arreglar dichos errores y dejaron el juego en un estado malo. Pero no pienses que con eso el juego ya esta muerto, por suerte la comunidad hermosa de, si los fans de la franquicia de Silent Hill crearon un parche que corrije y soluciona el 80% de los bugs que el juego tiene (Eso incluye los crasheos instantaneos en las pantallas de cargando, no mas sufrimiento con eso).

Fuera de eso, el juego tiene una historia relativamente interesante, pero el rumbo que este juevo va comparado a los silent hill pasados es diferente, ya no es un survival horror en si, es solamente un survival sin mucho miedo con una mecanica de combates medianamente mala (aunque puede que yo sea la mala aqui), aunque no por eso quita el echo que la historia de juego es bastante interesante.

Recomiendo comprarlo?, unicamente y puramente si lo vez en descuento, su precio completo no vale para nada la pena. Y un enorme agradecimiento a 𝓩𝓪𝓹𝓸𝓬 que fue quien nos compartio el Fix en estas criticas, y obviamente a Unokwn project que fue los que arreglaron lo que Konami debio hacer.",

lo que se puede mejorar:LA HISTORIAAAA, la historia no me gusto mucho la verdad, encuentro que el final del juego me dejo mucho que desear, esperaba un final mas satisfactorio tal vez?, para que me recompensen con la pésima experiencia de juego que dieron.

L'avevo droppato due anni fa, ma di recente ho provato a dargli una seconda possibilità. Disinstalla, formatta e reinstalla. Ma niente, sempre gli stessi problemi. Allora per quanto mi riguarda questo gioco può marcire nell'inferno in cui è ambientato.

Плюсы: 
Хорошая атмосфера; интересный сюжет (хоть и предсказуемый); приятно сделанный кошмарный мир; разнообразие концовок.
Минусы:
Скучные загадки: сопоставь провода, покрути диски, поиграй в пятнашки (после пианино из sh1 и часов sh2 очень слабо). Плохая боевка и стрельба. Зачастую ближний бой превращается в тупое закликивание. Стрельба выполнена просто на ужаснейшем уровне, нет никого разброса при прицеливании, чувства, что ты выстрелил тоже нет, персонаж, как будто просто является gif-кой. Не удобное управление (действие на лкм прицеливание и боевая стойка на L shift, 2 инвентаря на e и q). Уродливые лицевые анимации. Способ получения концовок (за всю игру будет только 3 выбора влияющих на концовку и все они почти в самом конце игры, что делает перепрохождение не имеющим смысла)
Итог:
В данном обзоре были упомянуты проблемы и плюсы исправленной версии игры. Если учитывать еще проблемы steam версии, то сюда можно, добавить ограничение на 30 fps, постоянные фризы, вылет игры при сворачивании, отсутствие обозначений кнопок. Homecomming стал неким возвращением серии к истокам после 4 и origins. Можно сказать, что игра была бы отличной в более опытных руках.

Bu oyunun bu kadar kötü olmasının ana nedeni, korkunç oyun mekaniği ve kötü tasarlanmış kontrollerdir ve PC versiyonu daha da kötüdür, ilk defa kontrollerin yapılandırıldığımdan farklı davranmaya başladığına inanamadım. Sonra bu 30 liralık çöplüğü oynamak için bir x360 kolu satın aldıktan sonra, bu oyunda savaş mekaniklerinin ne kadar KÖTÜ olduğuna şaşırdım. Shepherd'ın eski bir denizci olması gerekiyor ama yorgun yaşlı bir adam gibi hareket ediyor ve bir çocuk gibi dövüşüyor. Düşmanlar çok can sıkıcıdır ve çok şanslı olmadığınız sürece tek bir vuruşu asla kaçırmazlar, bu oyun gerilim ve korku yerine aksiyona odaklanmıştır. İlk bulmacalar kolay ve tüm atmosfer iyi ve oyunun temel korku yönlerini korumayı başardılar, ama o bildiğimiz ürkütücü ve hüzünlü müzik nerede? Karakterler çok topal ve sıkıcı, mekanlar cehennem gibi tekrar ediyor ve düşmanlar hep öngörülebilir yerlerden çıkıyor, oyuncuları o kadar korkutmuyor. Ayrıca düşman tasarımı tekrarlayıcı ve sıkıcı, düşman her zaman savaşta avantaja sahip ve saldırılar çok ucuz ve yetersiz, bazı öldürme animasyonları iyi ama diğerleri tam bir şaka, 2 karelik animasyon gibi, işte BU KADAR korkunç. Günün sonunda bu oyunu ait olduğu yere, çöpe atmak isteyeceksiniz, tam bir felaket ve Silent Hill oyunları koleksiyonunuz yoksa veya serinin hayranı değilseniz almanızı tavsiye etmiyorum.

Contras

-No compatible con Alt Tab y dos monitores (el mouse se vuelve loco y se termina por desplazar por los dos hay que reiniciar juego)
-Mientras mas progreses en el juego mas lento se va a poner (Clipping de audio aveces)
-Crasheos por hacer doble clicks debes en cuanto.
-Tarda mucho en cargar el juego entre escenarios (incluso puerta y puertas cada tanto)
-Se parece mucho a Silent Hill 2 pero le falta un poco de picardia que se le dio a el Silent Hill 2, aveces es como muy instantaneo (Como cuando muere la madre), no hay tiempo de parar el timing narrativo como le pasa a James en SH2.
-Se le sale el ingrediente que sh1 ,2 y 3 tienen, no se siente mucho a un Silent Hill, parece un resident evil de momentos.

137636691,russian,2023.04.01 23:05,❌,✅,0.5688322783,3,"Начну с того, что чтобы поиграть нормально в игру нужно установить патчи, ведь поставив в настройках 60 кадров, она все равно будет выдавать 30 (Некоторые вообще думали, что игра не может выдавать больше 30, но нет, может, разработчики просто говна поели). Но к сожалению даже патчи не помогли мне исправить звук, который громкий в правом ухе, но тихий в левом. Мне буквально пришлось ставить монозвук на моих наушниках, чтобы нормально поиграть. У игры отвратительная оптимизация, постоянные просадки кадров (особенно когда сражаешься против врага, который пускает дым. Разработчики даже дым нормально не смогли сделать), очень долгие загрузки, НО ЧТО САМОЕ ГЛАВНОЕ постоянные краши, из-за которых теряешь много прогресса. Почему? Да потому что разработчики похоже не смогли сделать автосейвы, а сейвпойнты расположены обычно в таких местах, что вообще постоянно задаешься вопросом были ли у игры хоть какие-то геймдизайнеры? 
В отличие от других игр серии в этой части решили сделать очень интересную и проработанную боевую систему. Жаль, конечно, что они сделали её очень убогой и топорной. Главный герой не может таскать больше двух обойм патрон в запасе (КТО ПОДУМАЛ, ЧТО ЭТО БУДЕТ ХОРОШЕЙ ИДЕЕЙ???), и из-за этого вы почти всегда будете использовать ближний бой, от которого вы не будете получать удовольствие. Наоборот, вы будете страдать. Особенно если на вас нападает больше одного врага, тогда лучше просто убегать, но только от некоторых монстров. Почему? потому что разработчики не смогли нормально распределить урон атак врагов. Некоторые могут ударом снести половину хп, некоторые вообще практически не наносят урон (кто-то, конечно, скажет, что так и было задумано, но когда собака сносит больше, чем существо с длинными когтями, начинаешь очень сильно в этом сомневаться). Это очень классно учитывая, что хиллок в игре не много и если вдруг вы их все использовали и сохранились, то вы можете начинать всю игру заново, так как некоторые моменты в игре просто невозможно пройти без урона. А теперь конкретнее про врагов. В игре встречаются медсестры и Пирамидхэд из второй части серии. Добавлены просто, чтобы прибавить популярности игре, ведь ЭТО ЖЕ ПИРАМИДХЭД, ИКОНА СЕРИИ, КАК И МЕДСЕСТРЫ, ОНИ ВООБЩЕ ТАКИЕ КРУТЫЕ, вот только (я конечно не удивлен) разработчики похоже даже не играли в игру, из которой они появились, ведь тогда бы они знали, что эти противники были связаны сюжетно с Джеймсом и их наличие в Хоумкаминге лишь показывает отсутствие хоть какого-либо уважения к серии. Остальные противники на удивление оригинальные и некоторые даже имеют некий символизм (который должен иметь каждый противник, но да ладно).
Сюжет в игре такой же тупой как и главный герой. Алекс постоянно задает просто наитупейшие вопросы таким же тупым персонажам. А вы тоже даёте дробовик психически больному человеку, который может быть абсолютно непредсказуем? А вы тоже расклеиваете листовки о пропавших людях в городке, на улицах которого бродят монстры, убивающие всех подряд? Интересно куда же пропали все люди? К вам подходит мужчина, который ищет своего умершего брата и вы, зная, что его брат умер, собираетесь ему помогать в поисках? А концовки-то какие в игре... Вы можете получить шуточные концовки при первом же прохождении, выбирая определенные варианты в диалогах. Вы убили мать? Теперь вас похитят в конце игры НЛО. Вы убили батю? Теперь вас превратят в Пирамидхэда в концовке(????????????) и так далее.
Меня вообще всегда удивляли люди, которые говорили, что эта игра не такая уж и плохая. Как можно играть в это и терпеть ужасную боевку, отвратительную оптимизацию, тупейший сюжет, и потом говорить о том, какая же игра нормальная. Возможно такие люди никогда не играли в первую, вторую или третью часть. (исправляйтесь) 
Музыка - единственная по-настоящему хорошая вещь в игре. Я в Акире никогда не сомневался, но я точно не думал, что треки в этой игре будут НАСТОЛЬКО ХОРОШИ. Даже для такой ущербной игры он постарался на славу.

Silent Hill 1-4 deserve to be added to Steam so that a new generation of horror fans can experience these masterpieces.

I saw a lot of ads for it when I was a kid, and the Lurkers scared the shit outta me. So as I was exiting my comfort zone and starting to dabble with horror games, I figured I'd look into the game. That's what's kinda funny/sad about Homecoming: it's a great Silent Hill game for kids. SH Lite! It's full of action, gore, cliches, cheap scares, and easy puzzles. The level design is the most linear of any SH game too. All of this made it a great experience for me as a middle-schooler.

But looking back on it, no, it is NOT a good SH game.

It does have great music though! And the story could have actually been really good if it wasn't for the sloppy execution. There's a lot of decent symbolism, and the monster design here is pretty great. Sadly, it's SO American. Big-titted Nurses and a buff movie-Pyramid Head shoehorned in just for the sake of having them there, a black sidekick who at one point literally says ""oh hell nah"", a forced love interest that has nothing to do with the plot... Like I said, all this seemed like it rocked when I was a kid. When you're not spending an hour walking (there's a LOT of walking), you spend a few moments doing macho war-hero combat. But fighting monsters, especially in this half-baked PC port, is more frustrating than anything. Once you figure out the right combos for each weapon, and nail the dodge timing, you should be fine. But there are still some attacks that feel cheap and unavoidable, especially when fighting Smogs or Scarlet. I do like the ""realistic"" battle wounds, but only when they actually show up. Blood and other effects like to simply stop showing up at times, even post-patching.

Speaking of patches, you probably need to patch the game in order to play it here on Steam. While I only had it crash on me once pre-patch (while trying to change the resolution of all things), Konami has never been known to make good PC ports, dating as far back as SH2-4. It's really sad that this is the only SH game on Steam, and even more sad is that they still sell it for $40. Get a Kinguin key or wait 'til it's on sale.

Despite the copious cons, I'm blinded by the few pros thanks to nostalgia. Hot take: I think it's a lot better than Downpour. I'm giving this a positive review because I have had decent fun replaying it. But also, just do yourself a favor and figure out a way to play the first 4 games.

I cannot express in enough words how much I despise what not only this game stands for, but for the game itself.

The gameplay is horrible. The story is dogshit. The characters are as tasteless as a piece of cardboard, fuck that's an insult to cardboard. Worse than that. The atmosphere is absolutely trash, the game is not at all scary (got about one jump scare that appeared out of nowhere), the puzzles are the worst in any of the entire series, legitimately just fill into the shaped blocks.

There was one puzzle I got stuck on, but at that point my brain was so unbelievably fried from this heated piece of 45 (celsius) degree garbage bag day that I just clicked things until they set into place eventually, which it did. It was legitimately just a sliding block puzzle with half 1x1 squares and half 1x2 squares and there was no way to reset it other than to reload the game (I think, didn't even try) but my stubborness to just sit there and pointlessly click was probably a form of mental defense by delaying the game and not wanting to play any further.

Why did I push further? Because I love Silent Hill. The original four games were absolutely amazing (and Origins was pretty good as well) and I figured, maybe Homecoming was underrated.

Nope this is FUCKING GARBGAE PIFECE OF SHIT GAME FUCK HTIS SHIT QET)QI(#$OHG0823h98 gh32.

Anyway, this game is trash. From start to finish you are drip fed complete garbage, the animations are terrible just EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS IS TRASH.

EVEN THE GAMES I CONSIDERED BAD WERE NOT ACTUALLY THAT BAD THIS IS BAD THIS IS THE NEW LOWEST EVER GAME FOR ME HOLY FUCK WHAT A PIECE OF GARBAGE KONAMI YOU SHOULD'VE ERASED THIS GAME FROM TEH FACE OF TYEH REARHT HOW COULD YOU EAVEN THING THTAT HTIS WAS A GOOD IDEA FUC KM E.

Moving on, lets talk about the game.

Combat. It sucks. You can hold less bullets than in Silent Hill 4 and half the time the guns either don't work, occasionally won't register your input to shoot and if you're in a ratio beyond 16:9 the guns will just not work correctly at all. There are also some monsters that guns are just straight up ineffective against.

Looting and items. While you can find ammo, you have a maximum limit.. So, say you have a fully loaded pistol with 5 bullets (wtf man 5? fuck you cunt) and spares of 9 bullets (max 10 fuck you double shitstained helix), if you pick up handgun ammo, which would normally give you 5, it will delete the item on the ground and give you 1 bullet because you can't go beyond max. So you effectively lose 4 bullets. (by the way the max handgun ammo you can hold including what's inside your fully loaded Mk 23 Handgun, your first handgun, is 15 fucking bullets, that's 1.5 magazines in Silent Hill 4 and in that game you were mostly limited severely anyway but at least you could bring a up to 9 magazines technically..)

Are you cunts fucking stupid? One of the fun parts of Silent Hill is looting, hoarding and using ammo/weapons/meds when you want/need to. When you drip feed ammo and let me hold 3 bullets for a handgun that can barely dispatch one enemy, you force me to use the dogshit melee system.

You can also gunbutt, which is incredibly slow and does fuck all so there's no reason to ever, ever use this shit. Fuck you single shitstained cuckfuckix.

And oh my fuck the melee system. If any of the mainline Silent Hill games' melee combat systems were bad, this is so far below it that you can't even consider it combat, this is shitbat. or comshit. cumshit.

Half the time your dodges don't even work and you can parry for some reason but half the time you can't even punish if you land a perfect dodge/parry. If you're not locked on either, you will always roll but it will have no iframes or any sort of invulnerability or ability to actually dodge. Fucking retarded.

The knife is the best weapon, because it's fast, you can stunlock enemies and the heavier weapons take so long to hit that often times the enemy does a quick attack and breaks you out of it anyway. Not only that, heavy weapons barely feel like they even do that much more extra damage over the knife to begin with..

Strong Attacks/Charge Attacks are just dumb. Just spam light attacks and occasionally charge a heavy when you can, simply because the charged attacks can knock-over enemies, but damage wise it feels like it does about the same amount across all attacks.

So basically, everything is unbalanced and you should just use the knife the whole game.

Also, the game barely gives you any fucking supplies whatsoever. I once went through, probably about 5 hours of gameplay, exploring every corner and eventually I found 1 health drink, which heals around half of your hp. 5 fucking hours of enemies, puzzles and progression for 1 health drink. Did none of your fucks at double shitstained helix think about balance you retards? This isn't even about difficulty you're just a stupid fucking mongoloid retard who doesn't know how to balance a game. I bet you didn't even have testers for this piece of garbage because who the fuck would want to play this shit.

The story. It's so fucking shit. The reveals are shit and most of the mystery is just told to you immediately so there's no room to think for yourself. Everything is given to you on a platter and everything on that platter is just poop shit dung and the platter is also made of hardened poop shit. You know what, I'm gonna spoil it for you because fuck double shitstained cucklicks and fuck everything this game tries to stand for. Fuck you for 'Thanking Silent Hill fans' when none of us ever want to see you attempt to make any game, let alone a Silent Hill ever again. Fuck you cunts. Your character is just insane the whole fucking time. Yep. That's the reveal. You're just crazy. Amazing. Also you killed your brother, he fell in the water which for some reason you decided to go out on the lake with him and he didn't even struggle in the water he just sank. Nice, that makes sense. Then the next scene is his dad holding your brother in his hands? What? And the sacrifices, the bosses. Even the monsters, the fuck are they doing here? Why the fuck is Pyramid Head here? Why are the Nurses here? None of it makes sense. Eventually, you don't even fight fucking normal monsters anymore YOU FIGHT FUCKING STANDARD HUMAN CULTISTS IT'S NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST BIT SCARY EVERY SINGLE FUCKING BOSS FIGHT MADE ME BREAK OUT LAUGHING THIS IS SO FUCKING BAD AND BETTER YET THEY TOOK FUCKING REFERENCES FROM THE MOVIE THAT NO. BODY. FUCK. ING. LIKED. AT LEAST NOT ANYONE WITH A FUCKING BRAIN THOSE MOVIES WERE A MEME FUCK YOU SHITCUNT HELIX BUTTFUCKS AND FUCK YOU KONAMI FOR THIS SHIT WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU. Also, the same boss is copy-pasted like 8 times for a boss fight.

The characters. Not even sure I should call them characters, even TES Morrowind and TES Oblivion had less 2D characters than this fucking game. How do you even pull that off? It's incredible. Incredibly FUCKIGN SHTAR SHMEGMA>.

The puzzles. More than half the time the puzzles are solved for you and they are way too obvious that it's like they were making a game for actual children. Legitimately match the shapes puzzles and sliding puzzles.. Garbage. A lot of puzzles are also constantly recycled and some of them aren't even technically puzzles.

The atmosphere. It's trash, it's not scary, it's unspired.

The maps/area ARE TRASH. 90% of the doors are locked, broken or inaccessible. They give you a massive area, all with closed doors and a linear path. The fuck man? And when you explore the entire map, they give you the most uninspired dialogue/lore text whatever the fuck it is that is just not good. Oh, and also 3 bullets and a health drink. For exploring a massive area. Nice. Well done retards. -999/10. 

Fuck everyone who thinks this is good, you're a fucking retard who should never have an opinion. Retarded cunts.","Oh boy, this game is a legendary impure piece of galactic piece of immense immeasurable whale poop shit.

I cannot express in enough words how much I despise what not only this game stands for, but for the game itself.

The gameplay is horrible. The story is dogshit. The characters are as tasteless as a piece of cardboard, fuck that's an insult to cardboard. Worse than that. The atmosphere is absolutely trash, the game is not at all scary (got about one jump scare that appeared out of nowhere), the puzzles are the worst in any of the entire series, legitimately just fill into the shaped blocks.

There was one puzzle I got stuck on, but at that point my brain was so unbelievably fried from this heated piece of 45 (celsius) degree garbage bag day that I just clicked things until they set into place eventually, which it did. It was legitimately just a sliding block puzzle with half 1x1 squares and half 1x2 squares and there was no way to reset it other than to reload the game (I think, didn't even try) but my stubborness to just sit there and pointlessly click was probably a form of mental defense by delaying the game and not wanting to play any further.

Why did I push further? Because I love Silent Hill. The original four games were absolutely amazing (and Origins was pretty good as well) and I figured, maybe Homecoming was underrated.

Nope this is FUCKING GARBGAE PIFECE OF SHIT GAME FUCK HTIS SHIT QET)QI(#$OHG0823h98 gh32.

Anyway, this game is trash. From start to finish you are drip fed complete garbage, the animations are terrible just EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS IS TRASH.

EVEN THE GAMES I CONSIDERED BAD WERE NOT ACTUALLY THAT BAD THIS IS BAD THIS IS THE NEW LOWEST EVER GAME FOR ME HOLY FUCK WHAT A PIECE OF GARBAGE KONAMI YOU SHOULD'VE ERASED THIS GAME FROM TEH FACE OF TYEH REARHT HOW COULD YOU EAVEN THING THTAT HTIS WAS A GOOD IDEA FUC KM E.

Moving on, lets talk about the game.

Combat. It sucks. You can hold less bullets than in Silent Hill 4 and half the time the guns either don't work, occasionally won't register your input to shoot and if you're in a ratio beyond 16:9 the guns will just not work correctly at all. There are also some monsters that guns are just straight up ineffective against.

Looting and items. While you can find ammo, you have a maximum limit.. So, say you have a fully loaded pistol with 5 bullets (wtf man 5? fuck you cunt) and spares of 9 bullets (max 10 fuck you double shitstained helix), if you pick up handgun ammo, which would normally give you 5, it will delete the item on the ground and give you 1 bullet because you can't go beyond max. So you effectively lose 4 bullets. (by the way the max handgun ammo you can hold including what's inside your fully loaded Mk 23 Handgun, your first handgun, is 15 fucking bullets, that's 1.5 magazines in Silent Hill 4 and in that game you were mostly limited severely anyway but at least you could bring a up to 9 magazines technically..)

Are you cunts fucking stupid? One of the fun parts of Silent Hill is looting, hoarding and using ammo/weapons/meds when you want/need to. When you drip feed ammo and let me hold 3 bullets for a handgun that can barely dispatch one enemy, you force me to use the dogshit melee system.

You can also gunbutt, which is incredibly slow and does fuck all so there's no reason to ever, ever use this shit. Fuck you single shitstained cuckfuckix.

And oh my fuck the melee system. If any of the mainline Silent Hill games' melee combat systems were bad, this is so far below it that you can't even consider it combat, this is shitbat. or comshit. cumshit.

Half the time your dodges don't even work and you can parry for some reason but half the time you can't even punish if you land a perfect dodge/parry. If you're not locked on either, you will always roll but it will have no iframes or any sort of invulnerability or ability to actually dodge. Fucking retarded.

The knife is the best weapon, because it's fast, you can stunlock enemies and the heavier weapons take so long to hit that often times the enemy does a quick attack and breaks you out of it anyway. Not only that, heavy weapons barely feel like they even do that much more extra damage over the knife to begin with..

Strong Attacks/Charge Attacks are just dumb. Just spam light attacks and occasionally charge a heavy when you can, simply because the charged attacks can knock-over enemies, but damage wise it feels like it does about the same amount across all attacks.

So basically, everything is unbalanced and you should just use the knife the whole game.

Also, the game barely gives you any fucking supplies whatsoever. I once went through, probably about 5 hours of gameplay, exploring every corner and eventually I found 1 health drink, which heals around half of your hp. 5 fucking hours of enemies, puzzles and progression for 1 health drink.

Felizmente, o jogo está muito barato em promoções e há patches de fãs que já corrigem diversos problemas, mas aguardo esperar alguns anos até que o jogo esteja mais redondinho.

### História

Começando pelo básico, em Silent Hill Homecoming, você é Alex Shepperd, um residente da afastada (e vizinha de Silent Hill) Shepperd's Glen em busca de seu irmão que está desaparecido, fim. 

A princípio bem simples, entretanto, a história é contada de maneira bem críptica, escondida em desenhos de criança, mapas e arquivos espalhados ao longo do game, nada é clichê ou óbvio demais, talvez exigindo uma segunda jogatina para entendê-la como um todo.

Há diversos problemas: inspiração e ousadia nos desenvolvedores, o jogo imita e replica momentos de outros jogos anteriores da saga, alguns inimigos como a enfermeira gostosa perigosa ou o Pyramid Head são inseridos para puro fanservice, o protagonista é um grande coitado condenado a resolver problemas dos outros, as escolhas de diálogos são muito idiotas e inúteis, etc.

### Gameplay

O gameplay mudou bastante... saiu de uma câmera semi-fixa para uma câmera sobre o ombro do personagem principal. O combate do jogo foi alterado para ter mais ação com um sistema de esquiva, os inimigos tem um padrão de movimentação e ataque muito claros.

Entretanto, o sistema de esquiva simplesmente não obedece os comandos, uma hora você está pressionando para a direita e aperta esquiva e o boneco vai para a esquerda ou para trás, você solta o botão de combate mas o jogo não detecta e você fica vulnerável a ataques, os inimigos simplesmente repetem o padrão repetidamente sem deixar você reagir ou esquivar, os indicativos visuais do jogo são quebrados... várias vezes, o boneco claramente não te acertou mas você toma dano, outras o boneco te acerta mas você não toma dano e assim sucessivamente, e outros bugs que estão presentes somente na versão de PC.

De maneira resumida, se você topar o desafio, esteja preparado para passar raiva, pois você vai morrer e vai morrer, e morrer e morrer novamente.

### Cenários

Não tem muito o que falar, é típico de Silent Hill, mas senti que os cenários estão menores e mais lineares que os jogos anteriores da série... baita downgrade.

### Gráficos

Bons para a época, muito bugados no pc.

Throughout the years, [u]Homecoming[/u] has received mixed criticism. Those who like it will overlook its mediocrity and claim that even though it may not be the best entry into the franchise, it at least still has the ‘soul of Silent Hill.’ And you know, I’m inclined to agree. There is something creepy here. A mysterious title. A town haunted by a troubled past and inhabited by a host of dark monsters. All of which makes Shepherd’s Glen worthy of the canon. 

Just like the 2006 movie, [u]Homecoming[/u] is enjoyable and nostalgic. It’s a true effort at a new story. Series regular Akira Yamaoka (who also composed for the movie) returns with a melancholic and haunting score. That is not the only aspect it borrows from the movie. The transition from the town to the otherworld is the same 'peeling-off' sequence where the surrounding environment turns to ash. 

One aspect I admired in [u]Homecoming[/u] was the enemy design. Specifically, this game has some of the best boss designs in the franchise. Bosses like Scarlet and Asphyxia are my personal favorites. The combat is crude and difficult, emphasizing their dark and macabre design.

It has been interesting to read that some fans were upset at how Team Silent was not present in [u]Homecoming[/u]. They critique the Westernization of Silent Hill. By that they mean that Western developers like Double Helix Games (DHG) prioritize action over horror. This perspective is honestly a mixed bag. I largely agree with it, but it can be misleading. The combat can be lackluster at times. It can also distract from some of the grimmer themes of the game. Because of this, the game can seem less intense than some of its predecessors. However, more action is not a death sentence. DHG also introduced good new steps, like how in this game it is the first time the player can select dialogue responses that impact the ending. They also upgraded the franchise's graphics to another level, bringing a cinematic quality to [u]Homecoming[/u] that some previous entries may lack.

[u]Technical Epilogue[/u]

One of the most common complaints I’ve seen here in the Steam Reviews is that this PC port is horrendous. This is true. The vanilla port is riddled with technical problems. It is poorly optimized, and the game will crash at every loading screen. However, all you have to do to alleviate this issue is to go check out the [url=https://unknownproject.github.io/silent_hill.htm]Unofficial Patch[/url]. If you do this, problem solved. If not, then [u]Homecoming[/u] will be a needlessly frustrating experience.","[u]In Defense of Homecoming[/u]

SH games are great because they're generally good at sucking you into an anxiety inducing maze-like and alien world with grotesque monsters themed around body horror that torture the main character with psychological experiences. It's not about jump scares. It's not about fun and stimulating game play. It's not about collectibles or crafting or quests or anything like that. It's about feeling generally uncomfortable. The world itself is somewhat familiar in that it's an old backwater town but it's alien in how it shifts between a limbo-esc mist and ashy reality and a rusty, bloody and serrated nightmare reality. It also usually has a story well told about sins, cults, and existentialism and end up feeling hollow, and horrified. 

This game unfortunately focused on the wrong things. Firstly it's almost entirely about game play and collecting resources. You can't run away from enemies to conserve ammo and avoid injury, they'll just chase you down and force you into a combat scenario where each enemy has to be taken down with a specific weapon and has a unique set of attacks that you must familiarize yourself with and learn to block or dodge with QTE level accuracy. Even the starting enemies you must deal with one by one so it steals the focus away from anxiously running to standing and fighting with clunky combat mechanics. It wasn't fun. I found it to be more annoying and frustrating. Then the next part that this game unfortunately get's wrong is the maps. I don't know if it's because of the closer 3rd person camera and faster movement speed but the maps all felt considerably more linear. Save the HUB town of course. That's not inherently a bad thing but again this game doesn't really do much with 'em. More of a way to constantly lock you into melees with packs of monsters. Like more Dead space and less Resident Evil 4 but much less fun than both. I guess if the story was good, it could have possibly made up for it but the story is just kind of dumb. Standard religious cult wacko shenanigans and a main character with amnesia, conveniently forgetting their horrible sin. It wasn't really interesting or engaging. (spoiler alert), Main guy acted like a prick and accidentally knocked his little brother into the middle of the lake and the kid just died. Just *bump* *splash* *dead*. Dumb. He was gonna be the cult's super important sacrificial lamb anyways which is revealed long before you remember the kid's death so I don't see why your so racked with guilt over it. (spoiler alert over) All around, not even comparable to SH1-3. It feels like a bad fan game. The puzzles suck, the game play sucks, and it does a bad job of sucking you into the world.

Lately wanted to experience again those Silent Hill vibes that I loved when I was a kid, and since I do not recall to have ever played this chapter, thought to give it a chance even if I knew it wasn't one of the most beloved chapters in the series. 

The main problem that I have with this game is with the attitude of the protagonists and how improbable the dialogues unfold, like, I can't really immerse myself into it since no human being would act, respond or approach that kind of situation like the characters in this game ( especially the main character ). I mean, in the first 15 minutes you come back in your hometown, which is completely empty, roads suddenly disrupted, your mom walks into the house completely wet and in state of shock, and you don't ask why the fuck she looks like that and why she's soaked in this greenish wet stuff and dangles in shock with a gun on her lap. And instead of creating some sort of dialogue that would resemble any kind of real human interaction, you simply get out of the house and start stabbing monsters that for no reason are living in your backyard, no line of dialogue or thought about what the heck is going on, nor any kind of facial expression that would show how the protagonist is shocked to find out that his hometown is now hell, a normal Friday in Shepherd's Glen I suppose. 

You do not even have to worry about finding any fancy weapon to fight monsters, 99% of the time you're okay with your knife and smash combos like in Dragon Ball Xenoverse and literally stun and kill whatever you will find on your path, doesn't even matter if there are multiple creatures. 

So in the end you go on just cause you spent some money on it, hoping to find out if there's a finale where you can somehow kill that unsufferable brother of yours, just cause would be fun to ruin the miserable life of the main character as much as the developers tried to ruin yours if you bought it at full price. 

It is worth mentioning the musics and sound effects, those are really good and overall help to immerse a little bit into the situation and the city.

This version doesn't have achievements so thank God I do not have to play it all over again for another five times just cause I have OCDs and need to complete whatever I start.

Assombrado por pesadelos que giram ao redor de seu irmão mais novo, Josh, Alex encontra o lugar tomado por uma estranha névoa e sua mãe em estado catatônico. Para tornar a situação ainda mais intrigante para ele, o ex-combatente descobre que o pai desapareceu ao sair em busca de Josh.
Logo Alex passa a ser atormentado por visões aterrorizantes de figuras célebres da franquia, além de outras referências ao passado que só fãs da série irão reconhecer. Tudo piora quando ele se vê explorando a cidade de Silent Hill, que é vizinha de Shepherd's Glen, e começa a desvendar um grave segredo ocultado por sua família a respeito das origens do lugar.

Oyun, Silent Hill serisinin bir parçasıdır ve birinci şahıs bakış açısından oynanır. Oyunun ana karakteri Alex Shepherd'dir, Amerika Birleşik Devletleri Ordusu'ndan emekli olmuş bir askerdir.

Oyunda, Alex'in genç kardeşi Joshua'nın kaybolması sonrası, doğum yeri olan küçük kasaba Shepherd's Glen'e dönmesi konu edilir. Shepherd's Glen kasabasında, Alex hayatında bazı tuhaf olaylar yaşar. Ayrıca Silent Hill kasabasında bir hastanede uyanır ve kardeşini aramak için buradan çıkması gerektiğini anlar. Oyunun amacı, Alex'in kardeşini ararken kasabanın sırlarını keşfetmesidir.

Oynanış açısından, Silent Hill Homecoming diğer Silent Hill oyunlarından farklı değildir. Oyuncular, kasabayı keşfederken, etraftaki nesneleri toplayarak, ipuçlarını birleştirerek ve gizemleri çözerek ilerlerler. Oyunun mekanikleri, oyunun korku ve gerilim unsurlarının etkili olmasını sağlayacak şekilde tasarlanmıştır. Örneğin, oyuncuların karşılaştıkları canavarlarla savaşmaları gerektiğinde, düşmanların korkunç tasarımları ve müzikleri, oyuncuların gerginliğini artırmaktadır.

Silent Hill Homecoming'in grafikleri oldukça iyi seviyededir. Oyunun atmosferi, karanlık ve kasvetli bir atmosfere sahiptir ve oyuncuları gerilimli bir şekilde tutar. Oyun ayrıca, önceki Silent Hill oyunlarından farklı olarak, daha fazla aksiyon odaklıdır. Bu, bazı hayranlar için hoş bir değişiklik olabilirken, diğerleri için serinin önceki oyunlarından daha az korkutucu olduğu hissine neden olabilir.

Genel olarak, Silent Hill Homecoming, oynanışı ve hikayesi ile birçok Silent Hill hayranını memnun etmiştir. Oyunun korku ve gerilim unsurları başarılı bir şekilde kullanılmıştır ve oyuncuların kasabanın sırlarını keşfederken gergin bir atmosfer içinde tutulmalarını sağlamaktadır.

Playing the game of course the combat system is clunky, very clunky, the story is stiff, as in characters feel mechanical, they just don't deliver dialogue, or show enough personality to even appear human. It's almost like a robot wrote the story. 
The monsters are stupid looking, why does everything have a 'sex-pun' attached to it? It's ridiculous, and you have no idea how funny and stupid it is to be running from a butt-naked monster that looks like they have a head coming out of their crouch, I'm not joking, that's what you'll be fighting. Devs, that's not scary, that's just silly!

Here's a tip: you can spam the knife, I don't even use the shotgun with the same results as going in with a knife, I can take down over 8 feet tall monster bosses in this game...With just  a simple knife in a couple seconds. Even a gun is ineffective against the bullet sponge enemies that a knife can take down quickly. It's because of the flawed combat system, the faster you swing, the more time you have to inflect damage, rendering using useless.

 It's like that with Homecoming, and it's insanely immersion breaking, and kills the fear factor.

The locations do have this creepy factor, yes, but once you recognize that everything you encounter is so weak, you can beat them with a butter knife, the fear of the unknown completely disappears, and traversal just becomes a chore.

But that's not what broke the camel's back. What broke the camel's back was the game's mediocre endings in the game. You'll make seemingly trivial choices, and receive an outcome you didn't want, which makes playing the entire game seem fruitless, and pointless. You played this game for 15 hours, not realizing that the choice you made doomed you to an ending outcome you wish you can take back, but can't without playing the entire crappy game from the start. Trust me when I say you will cringe at the thought of having to sit through playing this game trying to get 'the ending you want' all over again, it feels like torture.
And you should know, the main character's love interest you finally rescue whenever you do manage to get the 'good ending' you don't kiss at the end, or nothing, it's wooden, and fruitless, you get nothing in return, and you'll waste your time trying to get it, it's just not worth it. Just so you know. Just look up each endings on youtube.
The puzzles were insanely hard with a bunch of moon logic thrown in, and you will find yourself using wiki to find out the solution, just so you can see how everything ends. 

The game has no replay value, regardless whether you're wearing a different outfit or not, because the experience is unbearably linear, the story is disjointed and uninspired, the endings are unfruitful, leaving you feel like you wasted your time trying to get them, and the maze-like go here, go there's will have you yawning as you battle weak monsters that I honestly found myself just running past instead of fighting.

Don't get this game, even if it's just 10 bucks, it is one of the worst Silent Hill games I ever played, next to The Room, and don't get me started on that one. Woo wee was this game a stinker! It's a little charming when you play it for the very first time, but sucks at the end once you realize the game just never did take itself as seriously as you'd like.","I went into playing Silent Hill Home coming with a heavily optimistic mind.

Don't get this game, even if it's just 10 bucks, it is one of the worst Silent Hill games I ever played, next to The Room, and don't get me started on that one. Woo wee was this game a stinker! It's a little charming when you play it for the very first time, but sucks at the end once you realize the game just never did take itself as seriously as you'd like."

132307022,latam,2023.01.06 11:20,✅,✅,0.5,0,"He escuchado y leído muy malas críticas del juego, en especial por los bugs. Así que decidí descargar el juego e instalar los parches que arreglaban dichos bugs. Pude descargar el juego y al día siguiente, justo sufrí un corte total de internet en todo el vecindario, así que ya no pude instalar los parches. Pero decidí comenzarlo a jugar de todas maneras. Y la verdad que, fuera de que el juego me funcionaba a 30 FPS y que al hacer ALT+TAB y que al volver al juego, el mismo se crashee y cierre, no encontré grandes bugs que hagan ""injugable"" a este maravilloso título de survival horror. Casi una semana después pude instalar el parche y si bien me arregla los fps (no del todo porque los puse en 144 pero sin embargo funciona en 60), hay cosas que quita de antes, como por ejemplo una serie de QTE en momentos donde algunos enemigos te agarran, el QTE que era simplemente hacer click muy rápido del ratón para evitar una insta-kill, desaparecen, por lo que hace el juego un poco más fácil de lo que intentaba ser. Aunque por lo visto, la mayoría de la gente odia los QTE pero yo la verdad sí los prefiero excepto cuando te agarran desprevenido en juegos como Resident Evil 3(remake), 5 o 6 en medio de cinemáticas.
Fuera de bugs y parches. El juego es fantástico. No tiene los mejores gráficos como para el 2008 pero son bastante amigables y buenos. La historia te permite sumergirte muy bien en el ambiente de Silent Hill y Sheperd's Glen (un pueblo vecino), en un principio no entendemos nada pero a medida que avanza la trama, vamos atando los cabos sueltos y se nos va complicando la situación cada vez más. El sistema de combates es dentro de todo sencillo. Solo hay dos botones diferentes para golpear, uno para esquivar y otro para encender o apagar el modo ""en guardia"" (en lo personal me gustaría que haya que mantener apretado el botón de ""en guardia"" ya que a veces al intentar apagarlo para hacer una huída rápida al estar rodeado de enemigos, nos ponemos nerviosos y lo apretamos más de una vez y al final no sabemos si ya podemos correr o no). Si bien, luego de jugar casi 15 horas, aún no domino a la perfección el esquive, no es una metodología súper complicada de combate. (Mi reseña marca que jugué 9 horas pero Steam no me está considerando las horas que he jugado durante toda la semana sin internet, así que le calculo que serán entre 13 y 16 tranquilamente)
Por otro lado, el diseño de bosses es fantástico. En lo personal, el segundo boss [spoiler](Scarlet)[/spoiler] me ha costado muchísimo, es bastante complicado de esquivar, y sobre todo para alguien que aún no ha dominado del todo el sistema de combate. Pero ese boss en particular me ha tocado mucho. No quiero dar spoilers pero solo diré que desde chico, ver vivir y/o animarse a [spoiler]muñecos o maniquíes[/spoiler] ha sido una de mis mayores pesadillas, así que sí, ese boss me hizo sufrir psicológicamente. También tiene puzzles bastante sencillos pero que sí te harán pensar un rato. Por ejemplo había un rompecabezas sencillo en la [spoiler]casa del protagonista para poder abrir un cajón[/spoiler], pero me hice un lío mental y estuve casi dos horas para resolverlo.
Ya estoy por finalizar el juego, me encuentro en la última parte. Decidí jugarlo directamente en dificultad alta a pesar de ser la primera vez porque a veces soy salvaje en ese sentido. Al principio cuesta, pero a medida que vamos encontrando mejores armas y mejorando nuestra curva de aprendizaje para los combates y tomando conocimiento de los mounstros, todo mejora. Eso sí, para armas a distancia, la munición no es que precisamente sobre. Muy eventualmente llegamos a un punto en el que no se nos permite recoger más munición, pero no me ha pasado más que un par de veces. Cada mounstro tiene su propia técnica para matar, y lo bueno (o malo dependiendo el punto de vista) es que los tips para hacerlo sólo aparecen durante pantallas de carga y en especial para los bosses, en la pantalla de carga una vez que nos han matado a nosotros y se está cargando de nuevo para volver al ataque.
Por otro lado, para los speedrunners, las cinemáticas se pueden saltear (excepto algunas excepciones donde hay diálogo y opciones de diálogo para seguir con la trama). Y por último pero no por ello menos importante. El juego sí que nos hace dar varios julepes (sustos). En lo personal no soy tan fan del survival horror, sino más bien prefiero el terror psicológico, onda outlast, amnesia, entre otros donde para sobrevivir solo podemos correr y escondernos. El hecho que un juego de terror te dé las posibilidades de matar a tus enemigos, le disminuye un poco la sensación de horror para mi gusto. Me gusta mucho más sentirme indefenso.
Lo negativo que tengo es el soundtrack. La verdad no es una banda sonora memorable, excepto tal vez la canción del menú principal y la canción de los créditos finales. Pero bueno, eso es un tema totalmente subjetivo. Pero por lo general siempre tengo presente las bandas sonoras de los juegos de terror. Esta entrega de Silent Hill es una excepción a la regla lamentablemente.

A la espera de la salida de Silent Hill 2 remake, terminaré este juego y luego jugaré Silent Hill The Room que se encuentra en la otra plataforma de juegos. Es una lástima que solo estén disponibles (al menos en tiendas oficiales) solo Silent Hill Homecoming (creo que es la sexta entrega) y The Room (creo que es la cuarta) para PC, ya que es una de las sagas de survival horror más alabadas de todos los tiempos.
100% recomendado, y si quieres mejorar la experiencia de juego, instala los parches que no son tan complejos de instalar. Van a mejorar algunas cosas como el brillo y la luz ambiente, además de los FPS.",

[b] Advertencia: el juego está lleno de problemas críticos y de bugs graves que de no ser solucionados o de no estar prevenido de ellos, pueden arruinar por completo la experiencia. [/b]

Debo decirlo, este juego está lleno de problemas varios de todo tipo, algunos menos serios, y otros que lo son tanto, que te pueden estropear totalmente la partida; desde fallos fácilmente solucionables, como una mala configuración de sonido, hasta crasheos al minimizar el juego o en las pantallas de carga que te pueden hacer perder el progreso y obligarte a volver a empezar desde el último punto de guardado manual.

Sin embargo, pese a todo esto, solventé lo que era resoluble (en la comunidad hay multitud de guías de como optimizar el juego), y he de confesar que me ha encantado poder formar parte de la experiencia [i]Silent Hill[/i], aun si es desde uno de los juegos menos queridos de la franquicia. 

Ha sido de lo más interesante, pues si bien no he jugado a otras entregas y solo las he visto en videos, las sensaciones que me transmite el juego son las mismas, una especie de atmósfera inefable envuelve al juego que me ha cautivado y que ha hecho que me merezca la pena hasta el último de los sinsudores que me han causado los bugs.

Asimismo, el precio es desproporcionado, especialmente al tener en cuenta la calidad del juego, así que si tienes intención de adquirirlo te invitaría a hacerlo de rebajas, lo que hará que te sientas más satisfecha con el producto que vas a encontrar cuando lo juegues.

Resumiendo: incluso con todos sus errores y desaciertos lo recomiendo, pues es la única manera actualmente de sentir en primera persona el efecto [i]Silent Hill[/i] desde Steam y, si tienes la paciencia de tolerar sus múltiples dificultades y disfrutas el terror y el misterio, es posible que lo disfrutes tanto como lo he hecho yo.",

Se um dia a Konami quiser consertar essa versão podre de PC, tente pegar de graça, porque gastar com esse jogo é o maior desperdício de dinheiro que você terá na vida, mas sabemos que essa empresa de merda não faz nada com as franquias consagradas dela além de matá-las então fique longe desse jogo pro seu próprio bem.

A história em si é OK, a gameplay é como se fosse um RE4 mal feito, as mecânicas de combate e principalmente esquiva são uma porcaria, o Alex é extremamente lerdo na hora de desviar de golpes. 
A ambientação do jogo é até bacana, talvez o único ponto positivo desse jogo horrendo. 

Só joguei esse lixo porque estava maratonando os jogos da franquia e acabei me deparando com essa atrocidade que chamam de jogo. Odiei cada segundo jogando isso daqui e quando terminei eu não quis nem saber de pegar outros colecionáveis, se um dia eu voltar a jogar isso é porque estou sendo pago, porque todo mundo tem limites, até pra se torturar.

Caso você não consiga pegar esse jogo de graça, não vale nem a pena gastar 1 real nele, guarde pra comprar um lanche ou dê uma força pra empresas que realmente se importam com os jogadores. 

Não sei nem como a Konami acordou pra vida e anunciou 3 Silent Hills em 2022, talvez seja um milagre, mas consertar esse port aqui? Nem espere deitado, sentado vai cansar e se esperar é capaz de você morrer e ela não ajeitar essa bizarrice...",

This is easily the most buggy game I have on Steam. In order to look at your map you have to play at 720p because that UI wasn't rendered properly at higher resolutions. There's also audio bugs where the dialogue and some sound effects will only come out of the right or left side of the headphones but then most audio comes out of both.

That being said, the actual game is amazing. The story is good, the environments are creepy, and the monsters look really cool. The combat is pretty clunky but out of the Silent Hill games it's the best combat. In terms of scariness I'd say it's mostly scary in the beginning, and then it gradually has more action segments after the first boss fight. However, the story is still engaging and it's overall pretty fun.

If you're willing to tolerate the bugs then this game is pretty good, but definitely wait for a sale because this is not worth $40.","Amazing game, awful port.

As a big fan of the Silent Hill series I really wanted to give this game a shot. The fact that it wasn't made by Team Silent is very visible, it clearly ""misses something"" - but it's not what made me dislike the game.

The controls are weird and they also happen to not work during significant parts of the game - mostly during quick time events. It makes the battle with the third boss absolutely unbeatable as not smashing the buttons = instant kill. I don't know, this is where I finally gave up. Fuck you Asphyxia.

The combat isn't great either, it took me half of the game to get used to it (and to realise that I can DODGE the attacks). And of course the constant crashes, oh the true horror.

Story-wise the game's not bad. It's not OG Silent Hill good but good enough to get me invested. I wasn't a big fan of the location design though. I think the only one that I liked was the ""Hell Descent"" one, it really gave me the creeps. The fight with the boss that appears in that section was also my favourite - Scarlet is the best designed monster in Homecoming imo, the battle with her sure is hard but satysfying. 

If it comes to other monsters, their designs are okay-ish, don't have any special thoughts about them apart from them being hella annoying to fight. [spoiler]And let's not talk about Pyramid Head being in the game, I don't have the patience for this one lmao.[/spoiler]

To sum up, the game is not as bad as I thought it'll be but the port absolutely ruins the whole experience. I just hope it'll get fixed someday.

Taktiež, keď hráte na sluchadlách, hlasy určitých postáv sa prejavujú na opačnej strane sluchadla ako napr. [b]Alex[/b] stojí na pravej strane a hlas sa ozýva z ľavého sluchádla. Hratelnosť je pomerne zložitá ale dá sa na to zvyknúť. Atmosféra je tiež celkom na chuja, pretože nejde o horor ale skôr akciu.

I must warn any potential buyers before this review that this game ""as bought"" here on Steam is busted and broken and a crashfest. Loading times are completely unreal and sometimes the game just freezes up for no reason for about 30 seconds.

Also get this... all the voices will come out of one side of the speaker so dont expect to use headphones.  They say there are fixes for this but I have not found a working one.  This is my warning to all potential buyers.
DISCLAIMER: This review is of it vanilla from Steam. No patch.  I hear the patch improves most all my complaints.  Besides, I truly enjoyed the core game.


NOW ON TO THE REVIEW
This is my first ever Silent Hill game.  Right off the bat Ill tell ya, I can see why the franchise so loved and from what Ive heard this is one of the worst! lol

The combat system while clunky actually works very well if you dodge at the right moment but keep in mind, sometimes the game just doesnt take your input.  You press dodge and the game says ""nope"".  WACK! Every single freaking time.

I pushed through and I found the game actually pretty darn good!  I enjoyed the combat after a while and the one dimensional characters kinda grew on me after a while.  It seems to be a rare moment of mediocrity actually not being so mediocre.  It helps if you go in with low or no expectations and get it on sale...

I loved the monster designs and found them unique and different than anything else Ive really seen.  They really mastered that body horror that is very sexual and fruedian.  All the puzzles are nearly an afterthought with all the answers usually close nearby.

I guess I just really enjoyed it because I really wanted to play a Silent Hill game.  I have Silent Hill 4 on GOG that I will be attending to next.  All in all, I would recommend this to someone who is up for some punishment which kinda fits the motive of the game.  I pretty much feel the game is cursed.  Had to kill the final boss three times to see the end because power went out each time.  On top of the 20+ crashes I had.  Was it worth it?  You know, I dont know.  I enjoyed it but maybe it was my mind made up before I even played it.  

Anyway, take it how you will.  7/10","WARNING WARNING WARNING WARNING

Para empezar debo decir que el estado de este port es HORRIBLE, muuuy mal optimizado, el sonido funciona re mal, tiene muchos bugs, fallos gráficos y crasheos, también cuando quieres jugar con mando de Xbox o Playstation no te da la opción de usar sus botones (te salen números de colores) por lo cual es medio raro a la hora de interactuar en los comentarios donde te dan a elegir diferentes caminos de la historia, pero bueno, luego te acostumbras. 

Para evitar los bugs y demás tuve que utilizar como 4 o 5 parches de la comunidad que mas o menos lo mejoraron y terminó siendo jugable. Es una pena que sea así pero bueno, gracias a la comunidad es que podemos disfrutar de este gran juego.

Ahora mi opinión sobre el juego en si es: 
*La Historia: la historia es un 10/10, con varios finales diferentes que puedes elegir, toca temas muy serios y que puede que te sientas identificado con ellos (como en mi caso), la historia tiene algunos giros que te dejan re loco y alucinando, es imposible no reaccionar con cada susto, escena, o cosa que pasa en el juego porque está muy bien hecho eso, la historia es súper atrapante y ninguna parte se te hace tediosa o aburrida, al contrario, yo intenté disfrutar cada segundo del juego y tratando explorar cada rincón pero la historia me atrapaba muchísimo y cuando quería ver tenia 4 o 5 horas seguidas jugando.  Como todo Silent Hill en este ámbito es un 10, salen de la típica historia de horror y te entregan un guion excelente! 

Banda Sonora: La música es por mucho lo mejor del juego, intenté escuchar cada canción y sonido hasta el final porque la verdad que es gooood esa banda sonora, al igual que todos los Silent Hill. Hasta terminé creando una lista de reproducción en Spotify con todas sus canciones porque me encantaron. En mi opinión todos los SH tienen un 10 en banda sonora, es música de mi estilo y ojalá mas juegos tuvieran música como la de los SH. 

Jugabilidad: Creo que es la parte floja del juego, el combate es muy tosco y las peleas son tocar el boton de atacar muchas veces y listo, esquivar cuesta muchisimo y casi siempre esquivas y te agarran igual así que es medio al pedo. Lo que sí está muy bien es tener varias armas (como máximo 6) a las cuales podes mejorar pero bue, importa poco, casi siempre vas a melé para ahorrar balas. 

Enemigos: tiene muchos enemigos distintos y todos son brutales, los diseños son ultra turbios y te dan miedo. Los jefes ni hablar, son una joyita. 

Para concluir me ha encantado el juego, lo disfruté muchísimo y quiero seguir jugando el resto de la saga. Para quienes no lo hayan jugado se los recomiendo un montón! Usen los parches de la comunidad para que sea mas jugable y listo, a disfrutarlo! :)",

The game has its problems but I would give the game a 6/10 or 7/10 on controller its a good entry in the series and if you give it a try and get past the first boss you will fall in love with the soundtrack. Fuck the combat though just wait until you get the gun then you are good.

125818264,schinese,2022.10.20 17:22,✅,❌,0.5,0,"寂静岭归乡这部作品被交给了美国的制作组Double Helix制作。角色的造型、场景很大程度上沿用了寂静岭电影版的设定，取消了打倒怪物后必须再踩一脚才死的设定，增加了连锁攻击。在人物塑造上，打破了“主角是普通人”的传统，虽然阿历克斯确实是普通人，却能流畅做出前后、左右滚翻，闪避反击等动作，和在某些情况下攀爬比自己高的平台等等。

科乐美以“本作品不适合日本市场”的原因，取消了在日本的发售， 官网中也没有归乡的位置。 因此在老派玩家间很多人认为归乡是外传，拒绝认为它是正统作品，而同时推出的资料集（欧洲官网的Alex Diary.pdf）也是不值得参考的。而且很多地方照搬寂静岭2、3，缺乏原创性。本作在众多媒体中的评价偏低，通常在寂静岭系列的倒数第2、3位。

本作比较成功的一点就是剧情和人物设计的巧妙：

男主阿历克斯一心寻找弟弟约书亚的踪迹，历经磨难，不断逼近真相，最终找回记忆，却发现实际是自己误杀了弟弟，而正是此次事件强烈刺激了阿历克斯的精神，造成他罹患精神分裂症，篡改了自己的记忆来逃避现实。

所以，“归乡”根本就不存在，他从未离开过家乡去参军和经历战争，而是一直呆在精神病医院被强迫治疗，这种故事和人物设定，相当精彩和具有黑色幽默，有莱昂纳多的电影《禁闭岛》的影子。

当阿历克斯真正第一次与父亲面对面，得到了关于自己的部分骇人真相，这种残酷性，隔着屏幕我都能深深感觉到，不得不说，这是游戏对故事和人物塑造的巨大成功。

除了关于男主经历的秘密，游戏解密的另一条主线，就是阿历克斯揭开了关于牧羊人溪谷小镇“四大家族”的残酷秘密和骇人行径，这里就不剧透了。

这些故事背景和情节设计虽然极具张力，但一些重要逻辑性细节其实是经不起认真推敲的，毕竟游戏设计是以服务游戏性为主，这个完全可以理解。

游戏一共设计了多达6个不同结局：

完美结局：阿历克斯在战胜了内心的恐惧以后，与青梅竹马的艾尔一起离开了牧羊人溪谷小镇，去开启新生活。

从阿历克斯的经历来看（从小一直被父母冷落、虐待，不幸造成弟弟的死亡，而后罹患精神分裂，甚至被迫有“弑母”情节），可以说是寂静岭历代主角里面最悲惨的一位，这样的结局，我觉得才对得起这样颠沛流离、历经磨难的灵魂。

溺水结局：阿历克斯在家里被自己的父亲用浴缸溺毙，成为祭品，而通过父亲的说话可以得知，弟弟约书亚则是活了下来。

从整个故事背景来看，这个结局其实才是最黑暗的，这意味着牧羊人溪谷小镇的阴暗面和疯狂得以继续存在下去。

三角头结局：阿历克斯内心的邪恶抉择，最终让他彻底蜕变成了“三角头”怪物，这也代表了阿历克斯的内心彻底堕入了黑暗。

UFO结局：阿历克斯和艾尔被突然降临空中的UFO吸走，而威勒副警长也活了下来。

精神病院结局：阿历克斯在游戏过程中的选择仍然是极度不愿意面对现实，所以结局就是他仍是精神病人，实际仍在精神病院的手术室内接受残酷治疗，之前的一切经历都不过是他自己一厢情愿的幻想。

隐藏结局：阿历克斯在约书亚的房间发现约书亚仍然活着，发出一声惊叹。约书亚为阿历克斯照了一张“拍立得”，相片里的阿历克斯显然是个“精神病人”…这个结局蛮有希区柯克的风格。

这些截然不同的结局设计，强调了“因”与“果”之间的关系，你内心愿不愿意面对现实，愿不愿意作出改变的努力，作出“善”还是“恶”的决定，会让命运之路开始分叉，最结出截然不同的命运果实。

对人类个体心理创伤、潜意识世界和心灵生活的复杂性、冲突性、丰富性的微妙描绘和表现，一直是寂静岭系列的拿手好戏和永恒主题，也是寂静岭系列最大的价值所在，这种高段位的主题和表现力，可以毫不吝惜地讲，让寂静岭系列从艺术成就上要远高于一般的游戏作品。

人的信仰、勇气、自我反省、抉择与努力，可以决定自己的命运，人并非完全被命运无端摆弄之物，迷雾之中的心灵冒险背后这一核心主题，极富哲思，也相当迷人。

寂静岭归乡主要的问题在于差劲的优化、过于强调动作体验破坏了游戏的恐怖氛围，bug多。这个即使打齐了补丁还是有几率崩溃的，属于比较恶性的bug一类。",

I should have listened when people told me this was a bad port.  A bad port is an understatement.  Its a COMPLETELY BROKEN PORT.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!

Graphics first. Game is locked to 30 FPS.  You can get the game to run at 60 FPS instead of 30 FPS via a mod that WAS NOT straight forward to install, but thats hardly the worst part of this port.  You will have to put in some SERIOUS EFFORT to get the port to even work halfway and even then its not worth it.  It requires a metric ton of tinkering to even get to be in a moderately playable state.

The audio is TOTALLY BROKEN and ONLY comes out of the right side speaker.  You can install a mod to fix this, but the mod itself usually isnt enough and you have to install some third party drivers to trick the game into thinking its running 5.1 surround (THE ONLY audio available).  Believe me, this alone is reason enough to stay away from this game.  Even with guides, mods, etc, the game STILL runs like hell and crashes frequently.  I was never able to get the audio problem fixed properly.  it was ALWAYS jacked up even AFTER installing the mods to get it to work.  It was a technical nightmare even for someone who knows what they are doing, trust me.  Also, getting a controller to work with the game is another nightmare altogether.  The keybinds are JACKED UP, and cant be rebound properly.  I was able to get around it by mapping the controller to keyboard binds, but thats a half assed solution AND it leaves you with keyboard prompts instead of button prompts...Seriously, TAKE MY WORD FOR IT, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PORT - ITS NOT WORTH IT.  

If you MUST play this game, you need to emulate it.  After spending WEEKS (yes, I MEAN WEEKS) tinkering with this game to get it into a somewhat playable state, i finally gave up and went the emulation route.  SO MUCH BETTER.  Just save yourself some serious heartache and dont purchase this god awful port.  I am NOT KIDDING, this is one of the worst ports of ANY game i have EVER seen.  I am baffled that Steam is even selling it on its platform considering its a totally broken game.

TL;DR - This game DOES NOT work out of the box, and even with a TON OF MODS and a TON OF TINKERING, it still just falls short and isnt worth your time.  I wouldnt even install this game FOR FREE - thats how bad this port is.","***BUYER BEWARE - STAY AWAY FROM THIS BAD PORT!***

As únicas coisas boas do jogo são sua gameplay e trilha sonora, além da história desse Silent Hill ser interessante, porém, é apenas isso, os gráficos deixam muito a desejar, além da remixagem de som ser horrível, sendo quase impossível ouvir o que os personagens estão falando.

125382503,english,2022.10.13 04:46,❌,✅,0.5,0,"Well, it started off strong, and I really liked it in the beginning. I always wanted to play all the Silent Hills, but there was no PC version. I still remember playing Silent Hill on my old Sony Ericsson phone some years (decades) ago, so I was hyped once I bought this game. But...

Oh well, let's start off with the goods, shall we? Let's not always look at the glass being half empty:
The story was pretty good, in my opinion. A little bit of history, mystery, surrealness etc. The soundtrack was also pretty cool, the monsters are unique and scary in their own way. There are no lame jump scares, but that doesn't mean the game is not scary. I wouldn't say it's Amnesia level of scary, but it's decent enough. Also puzzles to keep the game interesting.

...and now, the bads. And there are plenty of bads. Which is the reason I am giving it a negative review, although the game itself is pretty good:
The notorious crashes. I'm not sure if I even installed the patch for this game, but judging by other people's reviews and experiences, it looks like it doesn't even matter. It wouldn't be so annoying if the game had checkpoints or game saves that are frequent (or manual save for that matter), but in this game you sometimes have to look for a save point for 30-60 minutes, which is not very practical if you do not have a lot of free time: You feel bad for quitting without saving but then you're wondering when the hell is the next save point??
Also, it crashes at the worst possible times, I don't know how many boss battles I had to repeat because of crashes. It even crashed at the very end, literally before the ending cutscene, so I had to do the final boss battle twice, not to mention that it kinda ruined the moment....

So I guess that's why it's a horror game, nothing is scarier than the game freezing after it's been a while since you've saved the game.
The loading times are ridiculous, even for some small rooms. I feel like GTA V has a faster loading time for the whole map. The gameplay is clunky, the audio is stuttering, has uneven volume and randomly cutting out, sometimes only playing on one side of the headphones/speakers. Boss fights, or even regular combat is just weird sometimes, dodging doesn't always work, and don't even get me started on guns sometimes being completely useless because the enemies' hitboxes don't always register hits....

I mean.... I liked the game, kinda, but with all these issues present I simply cannot recommend anyone to play this version of the game.","Well, it started off strong, and I really liked it in the beginning.

Dito isso, dizer que eu recomendo o jogo assim de forma simples é um pouco demais, o mais correto seria dizer que eu recomendo apenas para pessoas que já jogaram ou viram algum Silent Hill antes e gostaram do universo. Não é um jogo recomendável de jogar para pessoas que vão ter a primeira experiência com a saga e aqui vão os motivos:

> O porte pro PC, valha-me Deus mas que porte horroroso. O jogo é travado a 30 FPS (o que não chega a ser um ponto negativo mas pra alguns possa ser), existem crash's constantes, até recomendo salvar o jogo sempre que puder mas não se assuste se demorar pra carregar os saves é o charme dele, cutscenes travam com frequência, o jogo trava em algumas áreas pra que ele possa carregar o resto, contudo não é algo leve de alguns milésimos, são alguns minutos. Não recomendo o uso de ALT TAB. 
> Existe uma variedade maneira de inimigos, onde cada um fica mais fácil com uma arma específica. MAS, o combate é ruim, muito duro (foi o que ela disse). O jogo tenta ter um combate dinâmico com esquivas e piruetas baseadas no treinamento militar do personagem principal porém fracassa, além de parecer dificultar ainda mais o jogo. O sistema de lock on no inimigo é bem precário e muitas vezes irritante (principalmente em lugares estreitos, a câmera vira o inimigo). Alguns inimigos te agarram e nem sempre o botão de ação, o qual tu tem que praticamente clicar como se estivesse jogando LoL, funciona.
> A história é legal apesar de curta, mas nada digno de roteiro do ano.
> A ambientação é um ponto forte, algo que sempre foi durante toda a saga Silent Hill. A trilha sonora é boa e ajuda a criar uma tensão. As vezes o áudio tem problemas de saída, como por exemplo em algumas cenas que o som sai apenas de um lado sendo que toda cena é centralizada.
>O gráfico é bom pra o ano que foi lançado. Um ponto que vale a pena mencionar são os olhos dos personagens, são bem expressivos e o movimento deles correspondem muito bem com a situação da conversa ou do ambiente. A boca falha um pouco em questão de relação com as palavras as vezes até continuam se mexendo quando não tem nenhum áudio.

De forma geral, eu dou uma nota 5, apenas por ser um Silent Hill e eu ser um fã da saga, se não poderia ser bem pior. E vale dizer que seria bom comprar ele apenas em promoção, pagar preço cheio nesse game é triste demais.","Antes de tudo queria dizer que joguei o jogo de forma crua, ou seja, sem nenhum mod, patch ou configuração além do que o jogo oferecia.

Este Silent Hill es de lejos el peor título de la saga que haya jugado. Empecemos por lo básico; el juego de base está roto, nada más instalarlo y empezar a jugar, vas a notar problemas en tema configuraciones gráficas, de sonido y ni hablar de los controles que de hecho el juego no es capaz de reconocer un control de Xbox One ni de PlayStation. Por cierto, también ¡crashea todo el maldito tiempo!

Dejando de lado este tipo de problemas (graves) la historia es pobre, es obvio que la gente de Double Helix Games no entendió del todo la saga y lo que significa el lore de la misma, los personajes son bastante olvidables, quizás el único punto rescatable es el diseño de monstruos y escenarios, pero no compensa todos sus puntos negativos.

Solo lo recomendaría si realmente eres fan de esta saga y estás jugando todos los títulos disponibles que tiene. Pero eso sí, prepárate para hacer corajes y lidiar con ¡LOS MALDITOS CRASHEOS DEL DEMONIO!

NO TIRES TU DINERO, AHORA ESTÁN EN OFERTA VARIOS JUEGOS POR HALLOWEEN Y TIENES MEJORES OPCIONES QUE ESTE TERRIBLE PORT PARA PC. 

Pensé que los comentarios estaban mal y decidí comprarlo por que esta en oferta.

Tengo un core i5 10th y una tarjeta de vídeo gtx 1650, puedo jugar gow 5 a 90fps en gráficos medios/altos, recientemente me baje Alan wake y me va a 120fps en gráficos altos.

Pero con este y aun que sus gráficos son terribles, tiene unas caídas terribles de FPS. 

Te da la opción de ponerlo como máximo 144fps y aun así, apenas logras los 30fps y con unas caídas terribles a 20fps.

Es increíble que steam tenga este tipo de ports para pc.

Pero de los 53 minutos que he jugado y siento que eh avanzado bastante en ese tiempo solo me a ocurrido un error, el de que se cierra el juego. Y eso la verdad no me molesta nada. Puede molestar algunas veces porque el juego pudo haberse cerrado y no habias guardado tu partida o en un momento desafortunado en el juego. Pero como digo de lo que voy del juego ese fue mi unico error. Es totalmente jugable, OJO, hasta el momento, quien sabe que despues empeora la situacion y aparecen mas errores. Hablando del juego tienen buena historia, diferente a los otros Silent Hills pero tiene su esencia que lo hace unico. Recomiendo este juego ademas ahora que estan las ofertas de Halloween esta a mil pesitos asi que denle una oportunidad. Cabe resaltar que si el juego estaria con su precio original no lo compraria por todas sus reseñas variadas que tiene. Eso queso",

it's not the best of the series but it's far from the worst, it's a slightly above average game

[h1] positives [/h1]

1. the story is good and there is good attention to detail.
2. the best bosses in a Silent Hill game from fight mechanics and every boss has symbolism behind him 
    and the second boss reminds me of Dark Souls.
3. combat is improved and it's fun when it works properly.
4. the weapons have different uses outside combat and you get better versions as you play.
5. nearly all the other word segments are done very well
6. the art and music is good

[h1] negatives [/h1]

0. this is a major one, characters have weird looking teeth.
1. the game crashes, it crashed for me only two times the first time I started it, and on the loading screen of 
    the second boss but I died a lot of times so maybe its a feature like when you open Clash of Clans for a long time and it tells you to get some rest from the game in this logic I think they were the first to implement this feature and I like to thank them personally for thinking for the player mental health when they die a lot and I hope the team behind Serious Sam 3 learn from them.
2. this is a major problem that will affect your game it freezes a lot every time I want to save it freeze and when 
    cutscene starts and at random times but it does not take a long time to recover 30-40 sec.
3. I don't know if the dodging is not that good or I'm just that bad at the game.
4. sometimes the monster will lock attack on you and you can't go out of it in tight areas usually.
5. not a major thing but picking items up looks weird and there are edges to the item display.
6. you can choose what to say and it will not change anything so it's pointless.
7. the endings of the game are very bad and they have you can get the joke ending in the first playthrough.
8. no idea why they put pyramid head in the game removing him will not change anything.

Minha maior critica é os problemas de desempenho, o port feito para PC é mediocre, tendo os graficos um pouco inferiores aos lançados para consoles, problemas no som, fps caindo a cada 10 segundos, o jogo chega a fechar em certas ocasiões e muitos bugs, há um patch de correção feito por um fã, recomendo baixarem caso estejam afim de comprar o jogo, também recomendo pegar numa promoção, por exemplo eu paguei 3 reais neste jogo, resumidamente, é um jogo mediano, mas dá para se divertir.",

TO GET THE GAME RUNNING:

ONTO THE ACTUAL REVIEW (please note that my recorded playtime as of reviewing is incorrect because I played a lot of it offline):

The actual game is… fine, I guess, although it takes a bit of a dump all over the continuity. If you pretend it’s from a different franchise it’s an okay horror/action game.

The plot, without going into spoilers, is interesting enough, but is somewhat of a rehash of previous entries. The combat is kind of annoying with the way it makes you lock onto enemies, but not unbearable or anything. You can’t really avoid enemies because you just end up with a big line of guys chasing you down the street. Because of this, you’ll be using way more health drinks than you should be, which is annoying because the game is pretty stingy on them. Keep multiple saves so you don't softlock.

Save point placement is awful. When you first get into town, your first objective is to get to your house. There is no save point in your house. You are expected to go to the town hall whenever you want to save. This would be fine if it just told you to go to the goddamn town hall in the first place. There are a lot of points where there is no save point available after doing a particularly long level/""dungeon"", or a puzzle, or basically any time where you’d expect there to be a save point. It literally feels like the developers stuck the level maps to a wall and threw darts to decide where to put the saves.

The inventory system is pretty badly designed, in the sense that it’s kind of awkward to use and it’s way too easy to accidentally use your consumables.

If you can get past all of that, it’s a decent enough game. I really wish steam had a middle option, because it isn’t a terrible game and I enjoyed what I played of it, it’s just that I can’t recommend it with the amount of flaws that it has. It feels like it needed another few months in development.

Good things in this game:
Fun boss fights
Decent monster design
Good ideas/plot outline, even if it isn't always executed well
Real-time otherworld transformation. *chef's kiss*
Great soundtrack as always
Decent atmosphere

I highly recommend reading the 3 diary entries on the Silent Hill wiki before you play because they establish the backstory and characters.

Also get it on sale because the full price is absolutely ridiculous for what it is lmao","(edited for formatting)

Putting all these aside the game's strong points are the ambience; they nailed the SH fog and the OST (By the legend himself Yamaoka Akira). I've heard the lore is pretty good, With 7 hours on the game I didn't get very far into the story but it was okay.

I cannot recommend this game to anyone at full price. It occasionally drops to $2 ish, you can get it then. It's not a huge waste, but even with the fan-made patch, it was unplayable for me.","This isn't a horrible game, but a horrible port. I couldn't finish the game because my save file corrupted, I'll try to keep it as neutral as possible:

Technical Issues:
- Controller support sometimes works, sometimes doesn't (If it doesn't you have to remap it manually from the system files, but that's how I got my save file corrupted)
- Constant crashes (You have to reload your latest save, no checkpoints)
- Unskippable cutscenes
- Locked at 30 FPS

Game Issues:
- The combat was quite clunky
- It seldom gave any sort of healing
- Bland voice acting, mediocre animations

- Scarlet boss fight (miniboss asi v polovině hry) je brutálně těžký a po mnoha neúspěšných pokusech jsem musel nahrál předchozí checkpoint a vyzbrojil se i palnými zbraněmi a i s nimi to byl tvrdý oříšek 
- chybí hororová atmosféra - jde spíše o akční hru 
- hra je zamčena na 30 FPS
- bez ohledu na nastavení jsou občas dialogy vůči ostatním zvukům velmi tiché  
-  Unknownproject's Patch zlepšuje vizuál, odemyká FPS, zrychluje nahrávání, ale hra je pak extrémně nestabilní a  ve Quick Time Eventech se nezobrazuje, jaké tlačítko / klávesu máte zmáčknout - bohužel nepoužitelný patch

[u]HODNOCENí:[/u] 
I přes ne zcela ideální technický stav konzolového portu pro PC, nepoužitelný neoficiální patch a střetnutí s jedením opravdu nefér téměř nesmrtelným bosse v polovině hry  se jedná o titul, který má i v roce 2022 potenciál nabídnout milovníkům žánru dlouhé hodiny kvalitní zábavy. [h1]70%[/h1]",

I could go on about how it misunderstands the series and it's lore, but ultimately I don't care about all that as long as the rest of the game is good. It's not. This game is awful to a almost comedic level. The gameplay is awful, the story is awful, the characters are awful, its not scary, its not fun. 

The PC port is so fundamentally broken that even after I installed mods to help fix the game, it still didnt work. On a fresh install it would crash randomly and 100% crash every time I tabbed out. I have a friend who couldn't play the game stable in anything but a 600x900 window. AFTER I installed the fixes the game would STILL crash at random points, and the save system was completely broken. If I ever died or loaded a save, instead of taking me to where I saved, it would take me to the nearest checkpoint. These checkpoints are only present at the start of new areas. This means every time I got to a new area I needed to play through the entire section till the boss without dying or the game crashing, or I would have to replay the entire thing. This game is 9 hours, my playthrough took 18 because of this. And all that is only maybe 10% of the issues I had.

There are only 3 things in this entire game which I actually think were well executed. The music as always for this series is great, the otherworld visuals and monster designs were for the most part interesting, and maybe 15% of the time the atmosphere was nice until it got interrupted by a glitch or the awful combat.

No tiene buen diseño de personajes, pero tenes parry como en el dark souls. No tiene sentido la cantidad innecesarias de armas que agarras pero tiene combos como en el dark souls. No tiene buena musica pero hay jefes como en el dark sous.

En resumen, la historia es malisima parece que la hubiese escrito mi sobrino. La musica sin sentido y en situaciones que nada que ver. Los personajes eran todos iguales. Y las armas cualquier cosa por que te daban 6 armas a mele y 2 range. Y el final fue mas malo que el de breaking bad. 

Este juego tenia todo para competirle a aquellos que se golpean el pecho diciendo que silent hill 2 es mejor pero la pechearon como benedeto contra corinthias. 

SI TE LO REGALAN COMO EN MI CASO, bueno que podes esperar, jugalo y listo esta bueno, le terminas buscando la vuelta xq los pve estan buenos. Ahora si tenes que comprarlo, solamente te diria si esta barato y para que confirmes con tus ojos que es medio poronga.

I really enjoyed the first 2 Silent Hill games because they provide a lot of interesting narrative and unique ideas to the horror genre. 3 wasn't the worst thing I've ever played, but it sure wasn't great. 4 has somehow evaded me to this point, but I can emphatically say that with the concept of The Room, at least they are trying something different when compared to this game, which is a massive flop of old ideas poorly executed. 

I did not finish this game, and I feel no need to in order to finish a review for it. My opinion at the end of the game would most likely remain largely the same as it is right now, and I feel no obligation to torture myself with 10 more hours of something I don't enjoy. 

The combat feels like it belongs to a different game. Someone in my chat described it as suffering from the RE syndrome of the early 2000's where every horror game suddenly wanted to be both horror AND action, I think thats a good way to put it. The enemy encounters are far too frequent and more annoying than scary. The combat itself feels clunky and while I'm sure there is strategies to overcome this, I shouldn't have to cheese the game to win.

The story is... lacking? I should mention, that Deputy Wheeler's character is a marvel to exist in a horror game from the 2000's. He subverts so many tropes. He sees the monsters and isn't part of the ""well you're just crazy, I'm gonna keep on moving instead of helping"" crowd, and he is a black character that DOESNT IMMEDIATELY DIE in a horror game. Seriously, that never happened, so thats pretty awesome to see. 

That being said, the plot overall is almost like watching one of the later Saw films. It still has the bones of the originals, kinda, but ends up just retreading ground that didn't need to be walked over again and doing it in an uninteresting and ultimately unenjoyable way. 

Its worth mentioning that the game crashed on me 4 times, one resetting me about a whole half hour back, and I have a pretty high end PC, so I would tend to blame it on the port rather than something my PC is doing. 

Pass on this one, there are a lot more horror games you could spend your time AND money on, or just go emulate SH1 and 2 again, those both hold up and will give you some good times if you haven't played em yet.

I've played this game some time ago on an old PS3 and the game itself isn't bad (although it's still one of the weakest Silent Hill games, and I have played them all). 30 fps lock isn't that big of an issue for me, the biggest problem is constant crashing, extremely long loading times and corrupted saves.

Even with unknownproject's patch, my save games refused to work (the game would crash as soon as I load them). This is really annoying especially how far in between save points are (you could lose 20-30 min of progress just because the game decided to screw you over).

As for the gameplay itself, well it sucks. The game has puzzles here and there and they are not difficult (apart from that annoying sliding puzzle, use a guide for that one unless you want to get stuck forever). The combat is a total mess, but if you learn to stun lock the enemies with knife/ceremonial dagger, you could get some enjoyment out of it. You can also use guns in this game and you are given the opportunity of free aim, since the game plays in third-person view.

Also, use only knife/ceremonial dagger for melee combat and don't even bother with other melee weapons, and use guns only against bosses and tougher enemies.

Los Silent Hill siempre serán increíbles y, personalmente, este fue el primer SH que jugué y completé, y debido a ello siempre tendrá un lugar especial reservado en mi corazón. Pero así como digo unas cosas, también digo las otras: este juego es uno de los peores de la saga. 

La historia, los personajes, la atmósfera tétrica y decadente, la ambientación infernal y la banda sonora son, como siempre, lo mejor de lo mejor. En cuanto a temática de horror refiere, cualquier Silent Hill deja muy por atrás a la mejor entrega de Resident Evil, y eso yo lo valoro y respeto. Los personajes están bastante bien logrados, la historia es poderosa, entretenida y muy intreresante, la ambientación es espectacular y, personalmente, la banda sonora de este título me parece la mejor de la saga. Pero... Aquí es donde el vino se vuelve vinagre.

Normalmente, al criticar los puntos negativos que tiene un juego, trato de desligarme un poco de las opiniones generales, pues nunca me ha gustado ser una especie de canario que solo sabe repetir lo mismo. Esta, sin embargo, es una excepción, pues no solo la comunidad tiene razón en sus quejas sino que, comparándolo con otros juegos de la franquicia, el terrible bajón de calidad es como una patada en el trasero con treinta metros de impulso. La cosa está potente, así que empecemos de una vez.

- Primero, y lo más importante: el pésimo port de PC. En la versión de ordenadores el juego, en ocasiones, se vuelve injugable. Bugs, crasheos, bajonazos de frames, algunas cinemáticas se traban... Los tres peores que me han ocurrido son los siguientes. Uno, en el que, cada vez que vuelvo a abrir el juego y cargar partida, algunos de los controles se desconfiguran, y eso me putea demasiado. Dos, que puede arruinarle la experiencia a los más try hards y puristas, ya que si te atascas en un boss por cualquier motivo, haces Alt+F4 y vuelves a entrar, por algún motivo los jefes son mucho más fáciles. Y tres, el peor de todos: cuando vuelvo por segunda vez a Silent Hill y trato de buscar una forma de entrar a la prisión, el juego crashea y se queda en el umbral entre la pantalla de carga y la zona a medio cargar. Puede quedarse así perfectamente por 5 horas y no va a cambiar. Cuando lo jugué pirata hace algunos años me pasó lo mismo, y no pude acabarlo debido a ello (cosa que no ocurrió cuando lo jugué por primera vez en consola). De verdad, el port de PC es de lo peor que he visto.
- El juego se siente demasiado lineal, más acción que survivial horror, y eso le quita la esencia. La dificultad no está mal, pero no va acorde al espíritu de la saga. Los tiempos de carga son excesivos. Siento que, en ocasiones, la voz de los personajes está increíblemente baja.
- Homecoming tiene los mismos problemas de serie de la saga Silent Hill: jugabilidad torpe y acartonada, gráficos de van de lo regular a lo malo, mal rendimiento general... Normalmente, al ser defectos ""de fábrica"" serían más perdonables, pero solo resaltan más los fallos del propio juego.
- El fanservice es excesivo. No me molesta en lo absoluto que Pyramid Head aparezca en un cameo (algo de fanservice bien hecho nunca queda mal), ya que al propio Alex lo corroe la culpa. Pero no hay ninguna excusa con el resto de los enemigos que, básicamente, son todos de anteriores entregas. El peor ejemplo son las enfermeras. Eso arruina por completo el espíritu de Silent Hill, donde cada monstruo, cada lugar y cada situación significan algo. Los bosses están bastante bien. De hecho, perfectamente colocaría a Asfixia y Amnion en el top 5 o 7 de los mejores jefes de la saga, por todo cuanto representan, su diseño y su lore, pero con tan pocos jefes y tanto reciclado de enemigos no puedo simplemente disfrutar este título como se merecería.

Si eres pionero en la saga Silent Hill no lo recomiendo, o puede que la experiencia tan regular que ofrece te coarte y te prive de experimentar la que es la franquicia de terror por excelencia. Empieza por el 2, el 3 o el 4, pero no por este. Homecoming está hecho más que todo para los veteranos y puristas de la saga, y aún nosotros quedamos insatisfechos. Sigue siendo mi juego favorito de la franquicia (porque fue el primero que jugué y todo eso), pero no quita que sea uno de los peores de la saga. Aún así, recomiendo jugarlo para aquellos que deseen disfrutar de una magnífica historia, con personajes interesantísimos y una banda sonora de primera categoría, todo en una amalgama que forma una increíble experiencia de terror y horror psicológico. Eso sí, prepárense, pues no les aseguro que la experiencia jugable sea tan siquiera agradable.

Si quieres jugarlo, consíguelo pirata, en un emulador o espera a alguna rebaja, pues realmente no vale el precio que tiene.

Comparar esse game com outros da série chega a ser desleal, tendo em mente que os três primeiros jogos da franquia são muito acima da média, e estão no topo do gênero. E isso deixa a imagem de Homecoming abaixo do que ele realmente é. Quando o colocamos em uma prateleira de jogos de terror genéricos, com poucas expectativas de grandeza, ele tende a ser um jogo divertido.

Ainda assim, conseguimos encontrar pontos positivos a se destacar. Dentre os quais, a trilha sonora de Akira Yamaoka, o designer de algumas criaturas também devem ser levadas em consideração e eu diria que até certas partes do roteiro e a atmosfera que ele constrói. Mas seus grandes defeitos, e os pontos negativos que mais me atingiram, ficam a cargo do péssimo porte do jogo no PC. Entre bugs, crashs, engasgos e inclusive, desses o que mais me incomodou, os tempos de load, que são muito muito altos.

Eu só te recomendo jogar Silent Hill Homecoming se você realmente quiser muito jogar, porque do contrário, as chances de você desinstalar o jogo depois do primeiro crash ou bug são bem altas, e eu sei que existem mods para corrigir esses problemas, mas a grande realidade é que pessoas que jogam casualmente não querem se preocupar com essa dor de cabeça.

➤HISTÓRIA DO JOGO: A Trama é muito bem trabalhada, você começa sem intender nada do que está acontecendo e termina o jogo chocado por compreender como tudo se encaixa perfeitamente;
➤GRÁFICOS: Obra de Arte impecável, nível de detalhes absurdos, vai rodar no seu PC sem problemas é bem otimizado mesmo que não tenha placa de vídeo;
➤JOGABILIDADE: Muito intuitivo, o jogo te explica muito bem o que você tem que fazer ""sem dizer o que tem que fazer"";
➤PUZZLE: São difíceis se você não prestar atenção nas coisas como elas se apresentam, foram feitos para quem nota detalhes e presta atenção.
➤ No geral a Gameplay se torna viciante, o mapa é grande, bastante exploração, enigmas para desvendar sem ficar com trava mental sem saber oque fazer pois é tudo bem objetivo, nada repetitivo ou enjoativo e toda luta é unica.

➤Agora vou falar dos pontos ruins... tenho que ser franco com você, mas te darei as soluções para os problemas:
✅O jogo não tem legendas Português (Mas tem na GameVicio só baixar e instalar pelo navegador)
✅O jogo Crasha do nada (Patch2.5_PreRelease corrige isso e muitas outras coisas que melhoram o que ja era bom antes)
✅O jogo é travado 30 fps (Fix 1.7 - Steam006 corrige isso, você fica com 60fps e te disponibiliza a resolução 1360x728)
🔲Usando a Resolução 1360x728 você não conseguira fazer os dois primeiros Puzzle (Estante do Quarto do Josh e Caixa de energia em Silent Hill por problemas de resolução, terá que usar 1280x720 ""padrão do jogo"" até passar por essas duas etapas, então salve o jogo e inicie em 1360x728 que não terá mais nem um problema depois desse tipo) 
✅ O jogo pode Crasha quando você for abrir seu jogo salvo (Relaxa é so fechar o jogo e os programas que não esteja utilizando no momento e o mais importante, de um Atualizar na área de trabalho, resolve sempre você não perde seu save nunca pode ficar tranquilo)
🔲✅ O áudio do jogo, Usando fones de ouvido de qualquer tipo, do lado direito você escutará os sons de passos e ações enquanto do esquerdo as trilhas sonoras e sons ambiente, Não creio que isso seja um erro e sim um diferencial porem você não saberá de que lado o inimigo está vindo, fato curioso 'as vezes da pra escutar eles no lado esquerdo vai entender, mas não é algo que atrapalhe só um diferencial mesmo.

Au début, je pensais que le jeu allait tenir puisque je n'avais pas rencontré de bug/freeze ou quoi que ce soit, mais à partir d'une heure de jeu, j'ai complètement changé d'avis sur le jeu ! 

Silent Hill est une très bonne licence, mais celui-là, vaut pas la peine surtout ce PC qui n'est pas du tout optimisé pour.. Le jeu est bien bloqué à 30 fps même si on peut régler ça dans les fichiers du jeu, mais pour moi ça me génait pas réellement, en revanche, les freezes et crash me gène énormément, c'est impossible de jouer sans crash ou de freeze tout les 20 minutes, dans chaque cinématique, dans chaque sauvegarde, et même au plein milieu du jeu, c'était vraiment horrible, on prend pas du tout le plaisir de jouer à cette licence comme j'ai pu avoir sur les autres Silent Hill. On sauvegarde pas par peur de mourir mais par peur de crash.

Je comprends pourquoi les autres Silent Hill ne sont pas sur PC si c'est pour nous vendre de la merde comme ce jeu, croyez-moi, ça vaut pas la peine.

A ne surtout pas acheter, même en promo (1.99€) où j'ai pu souffrir durant 8h de jeu, en priant à ne pas crash.",

Puntos a favor:
+El soundtrack es muy bueno porque obviamente Akira Yamaoka es un Dios y Elizabeth McGlynn es una genia.
+Jefes espectaculares, Asfixia es uno de los más terroríficos que se hicieron.
+Buen apartado gráfico, lindo a la vista.
+Buena historia, atrapa desde un principio y muy buen plot.
+Mecánica y gameplay divertido.
+Buenos personajes y buen protagonista.
+Curioso sistema de decisiones que no viene mal, lastima que la terminaron de cagar con el Downpour.

Puntos en contra:
-Pesimo port, jugarlo en un emulador me sale más barato.
-Enemigos, todos reciclados de juegos pasados. 
-Poca exploración, es demasiado lineal.
-Es un survival horror donde no te sentís indefensos porque acá podes dar hasta volteretas, cualquier cosa.
-Occidentalización completa de la entrega, es demasiado yankee este juego y perdió toda esa cultura japonesa que venía con los anteriores, sobre todo el SH4.
-Pyramid Head es una representación personificada de los deseos de ser castigado de James Sunderland, así que no sé que c*rajos hace acá él.
-Las enfermeras también, ellas eran parte del trauma de Alessa en el hospital. Así de sexualizadas era por la frustración sexual de James, otra vez, no sé que hacen acá.
-Demasiado fanservice y dos millones de referencias a juegos pasados, literalmente el pueblo y apellido de Alex es Sheperd (Apellido de la ex mujer de James) dejate de joder Konami.

Conclusión:
Como juego funciona y es divertido, en menos de 6 horas tranquilo te lo pasas. Como Silent Hill es creo que el peor que jugué con diferencia, por no decir que este es el culpable que la saga perdiera el rumbo junto la esquizofrenia de Konami. Recomiendo este juego en oferta grosa, porque realmente no vale lo que cobran.

This game is hell, If it weren't for me streaming this game with friends I would have turned it off very quickly, theres just so many things wrong with it, ignoring the fact that it's not a good fit for a Silent Hill game.

Crashes - Plenty of them, mostly when I entered or exited the Shepard house, losing approx 40mins to and Hours worth of my time.

Freezes and Slow load times - Especially when saving or entering new areas in later stages of the game, i'm talking a solid minute or more by the end.

Lighting Issues- Pretty minor to be honest, but often characters eyes and teeth would be blacked out

Sound issues - Sound only coming through on ear, badly balanced, or some enemies appearing not to have proper voicelines play.

Lipsync - minor to me but it's bad

Puzzles that potentially softlock your game - The Mask puzzle later can and did ruin one of my save files, thankfully I was warned about this and had backups

Camera glitches - always when interacting with some objects like valves, it's clearly broken but a bit funny

Massive FPS Chugging in the later parts of the game

Guns not working ... like seemingly at all, at least the Chromehammer pistol did nothing for me the entire game


Control Issues - In general the combat in this game sucks, it's dreadful and I hated every second minus one thing which is the silly spin attack move the knife has ... but tonally It doesn't fit at all in this game, it's so stupid.

-Enemies will stunlock you, all the time. This especially goes for bosses
-You're rolls have little or no invincibility frames, so even if you try to roll you'll often get hit
-Enemies attacks and movements are faster than yours, especially Bosses, so even if you try to dodge you'll get hit, this is compounded by the lack of I-frames (Backwards dodging is the safest )
-Hitboxes are fucked, enemies will hit you when you clearly rolled away, and you won't hit enemies when you clearly did
-Horrible hit detection, especially noticable later in the game when enemies stopped staggering, there was no impact sound or animation often, for guns I got no indication they did anything, and i'm sure they didn't do anything - the only indication is sometimes enemies will have weird red marks on them
-Having to lock on to attack is frustrating, I often found myself not having enough time to dodge > reposition > lock on > hit because something knocked me on my ass already, this encapsulates bossfights.

-Bosses have a stupid amount of health, it's never obvious what you have to do, like the Aspyhxia fight were you cant damage her from the from despite looking like so. And her movements don't work well with how your meant to defeat her.

-The best way to beat most enemies is to stunlock them, with something like the knife in my experience, it just saves you the headache .. which if i'm resorting to breaking the game, means it's badly designed.
-Needlers are perhaps the worst enemies in existance, having the ability to block melee and RANGED weapons by just standing still, the aim I think is to go round or to the side/back of them, but theyre so fast you can't, the lock on system just prevents you, and then if you get caught int their grab you have to do a Quick Time Event!

LET'S TALK ABOUT THOSE QUICK TIME EVENTS

They suck, a relic of the time and don't belong in this game, especially since theyre broken. I died so many times to these because I needed to cling to my mouse and slam my fingers down so fast, it was so tiring. Bosses will spam these at you forcing to use most of your healing items, and regular enemies will use these too, often killing me in parts of the game where the last save point was 20-30 minutes back.

The WORST instance by far is the drill scene where It wouldn't work, thats right I didn't even finish this trashpile of a game because the QTE was impossible for me. I tried installing fixes, using an autoclicker and other savestates but couldn't get past this section, it's broken and comes so close to the end of the game, just a massive final F-You.

-The amount of enemies the game throws at you is horrendous. In the medical offices before the 2nd boss it will spawn 5 nurses to fight you in a tight corridor or small room ... WHY, why would there be 5 nurses here and why so many? Especially when the combat is so dire.

-Items, ammo and healing placements are really bad, most of the game I had no healing items because the enemies forced me to use them all, You get a lot more near the end but presumably you need those to combat more shitty enemies. Ammo was laughable. For a good 3 hour section in the middle I had no ammo, and after that my guns stopped working, making firearms completely useless. 

-As mentioned save points were also a problem, with early on them being very far apart, which didn't help in the section where the game crashed the most and I had no healing items ... horrible balancing.

-The map is broken, a pain to look at and it just looks bad all the time

-Other enemies have very basic horror designs that don't fit very well into Silent Hill in my opinion

-The cultist enemies are stupid, the look dumb, don't belong in a SH game, have very bad VA and sound effects

-Generally the game is so frustrating and glitchy that your never afraid, enemy noises would spook me, not because they were scary but because it meant I needed to use the god awful combat system and go through my resources again.

-The story is either trite, predictable or robbing off a movie or the franchise, see Pyramid head, or scenes heavily taken from movies like Jacobs ladder or Hostel.

-If it's not those things it makes little sense

-Characters aren't nearly fleshed out enough, you might see them two or three times throughout the whole game, and often the first time you meet it's not notable at all. They try to go for something with these characters, especially the Shepard family but it all falls flat because theres no reason to care about any of them, theyre bland, look bad, and don't feel like they have a reason to exist.

-The cult plot kicks in so late into the game and is so sudden, it just falls flat

-The fact that an Objective menu needed to exist is telling to how confusing the game is, because its so hard to understand what the hell you're meant to do at any given time ... like why am I going through this graveyard?

-Often I would have to backtrack around rooms, to find something so unobvious , just confusing and messy map layout.

This game is hell, If it weren't for me streaming this game with friends I would have turned it off very quickly, theres just so many things wrong with it, ignoring the fact that it's not a good fit for a Silent Hill game.

Crashes - Plenty of them, mostly when I entered or exited the Shepard house, losing approx 40mins to and Hours worth of my time.

Freezes and Slow load times - Especially when saving or entering new areas in later stages of the game, i'm talking a solid minute or more by the end.

Lighting Issues- Pretty minor to be honest, but often characters eyes and teeth would be blacked out

Sound issues - Sound only coming through on ear, badly balanced, or some enemies appearing not to have proper voicelines play.

Lipsync - minor to me but it's bad

Puzzles that potentially softlock your game - The Mask puzzle later can and did ruin one of my save files, thankfully I was warned about this and had backups

Camera glitches - always when interacting with some objects like valves, it's clearly broken but a bit funny

Massive FPS Chugging in the later parts of the game

Guns not working ... like seemingly at all, at least the Chromehammer pistol did nothing for me the entire game


Control Issues - In general the combat in this game sucks, it's dreadful and I hated every second minus one thing which is the silly spin attack move the knife has ... but tonally It doesn't fit at all in this game, it's so stupid.

-Enemies will stunlock you, all the time. This especially goes for bosses
-You're rolls have little or no invincibility frames, so even if you try to roll you'll often get hit
-Enemies attacks and movements are faster than yours, especially Bosses, so even if you try to dodge you'll get hit, this is compounded by the lack of I-frames (Backwards dodging is the safest )
-Hitboxes are fucked, enemies will hit you when you clearly rolled away, and you won't hit enemies when you clearly did
-Horrible hit detection, especially noticable later in the game when enemies stopped staggering, there was no impact sound or animation often, for guns I got no indication they did anything, and i'm sure they didn't do anything - the only indication is sometimes enemies will have weird red marks on them
-Having to lock on to attack is frustrating, I often found myself not having enough time to dodge > reposition > lock on > hit because something knocked me on my ass already, this encapsulates bossfights.

-Bosses have a stupid amount of health, it's never obvious what you have to do, like the Aspyhxia fight were you cant damage her from the from despite looking like so. And her movements don't work well with how your meant to defeat her.

-The best way to beat most enemies is to stunlock them, with something like the knife in my experience, it just saves you the headache .. which if i'm resorting to breaking the game, means it's badly designed.
-Needlers are perhaps the worst enemies in existance, having the ability to block melee and RANGED weapons by just standing still, the aim I think is to go round or to the side/back of them, but theyre so fast you can't, the lock on system just prevents you, and then if you get caught int their grab you have to do a Quick Time Event!

LET'S TALK ABOUT THOSE QUICK TIME EVENTS

They suck, a relic of the time and don't belong in this game, especially since theyre broken. I died so many times to these because I needed to cling to my mouse and slam my fingers down so fast, it was so tiring. Bosses will spam these at you forcing to use most of your healing items, and regular enemies will use these too, often killing me in parts of the game where the last save point was 20-30 minutes back.

The WORST instance by far is the drill scene where It wouldn't work, thats right I didn't even finish this trashpile of a game because the QTE was impossible for me. I tried installing fixes, using an autoclicker and other savestates but couldn't get past this section, it's broken and comes so close to the end of the game, just a massive final F-You.

-The amount of enemies the game throws at you is horrendous. In the medical offices before the 2nd boss it will spawn 5 nurses to fight you in a tight corridor or small room ... WHY, why would there be 5 nurses here and why so many? Especially when the combat is so dire.

-Items, ammo and healing placements are really bad, most of the game I had no healing items because the enemies forced me to use them all, You get a lot more near the end but presumably you need those to combat more shitty enemies. Ammo was laughable. For a good 3 hour section in the middle I had no ammo, and after that my guns stopped working, making firearms completely useless. 

-As mentioned save points were also a problem, with early on them being very far apart, which didn't help in the section where the game crashed the most and I had no healing items ... horrible balancing.

-The map is broken, a pain to look at and it just looks bad all the time

-Exploration is also really linear and I was never really rewarded for exploring

Como Silent Hill, Homecoming siempre fue un título que me gustó. Soy un gran amante de todo lo que tiene que ver con esta saga en la cual nunca encontré una mala entrega. La primera trilogía sigue siendo pura historia inamovible de la historia de los videojuegos, junto a The Room, Origins y Shattered Memories, que para mí son unos añadidos maravillosos. 

Homecoming, aún con sus fallos y sentido del combate más imperantes, siempre me gustó especialmente por mezclar con gran acierto la vertiente más psicológica de los personajes junto a la trama del culto de Silent Hill.

Por desgracia, esta versión para PC es un producto horrible: 30fps capados y con caídas, nulas configuraciones, crasheos constantes y problemas en la compatibilidad para mandos. En la comunidad pueden encontrarse varios fix, yo por ejemplo conseguí eliminar el ruido de imagen y poder colocar los botones correspondientes a los del mando de Xbox. A partir de ahí, poco más.

This is everything I did to make the game run 'somewhat' properly:

1 patch for 60 FPS. Installing it asks to create a shortcut but I still ran it through Steam because the shortcut creates saves separately and I wouldn't be able to use a Steam custom controller configuration (more on that later)

Another patch for audio which only improved it slightly. Audio was still low most of the time. The patch also recommended installing a Razer sound driver but when I tried using it, I got no audio from my PC so I wan't able to benefit from that driver.

And another patch for controller button prompts. Unfortunately it didn’t give the prompts for boss fights so I had to fumble my way through those. Also halfway through my playthrough, the prompts changed from Xbox to Playstation and I couldn’t fix it.

[So that’s 3 patches all with unintentional side effects. When the fan made patches are as problematic as the crappy port you know it’s a total **** show.]

Lastly I created a custom Steam controller config because trying to remap controls in game is ill advised. Not only is it nearly impossible to tell what button is what because they all were all just labeled generically but I would also get double functionality on some things. 

Also, the default speed of your character is jog and I prefer walk like in the previous games and rather than just trying to hold halfway on the stick for most of the game, I instead lowered LS sensitivity so pushing it all the way would still only walk and then mapped 100% sensitivity to a button when I wanted to run. Of course I had to unmap the button so it didn’t do a game function. (I chose the weapon menu and moved it to clicking in the left stick because that didn’t seemed mapped in-game and also because you can cycle through the weapons with the dpad so the menu wasn’t all that necessary).

I then did close to the same thing for the right stick because I found the sensitivity to great but once I acquired a gun, found the sensitivity I changed it to, too low while aiming so that needed 2 different sensitivities as well. At least with that I could map 100% to the aim button without the need to unmap it like I did in creating a ‘sprint’ button.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now here is everything I encountered during my playthrough:

2 crashes. Once the game just closed after the load screen following the first boss fight so I got to do that all over again. The second time gave an error message of too many something (I can’t remember) but following this crash is when my button prompts changed for the rest of the playthrough.

I couldn’t shift focus from the game to look up what to do when I got stuck because the game would just close after I tried to go back to it so I had to use my phone to look up what to do which was at least half a dozen times.

So it’s up to you really if it’s all worth it to even play this game. I’m a huge fan of the series and while this game in particular is middle of the road at best for the franchise, I still wanted to see if I could make it work. I was able to complete the game but in order to ever play it again I need to write a guide on not just how to run the game properly but also what to do in areas I got stuck in since I can’t alt+tab away to check online.

And so while I did enjoy the game in general there is 1 more criticism I have and that's the combat. There is a dodge mechanic that just doesn't fit. Staring closely at the enemy waiting for a tell so you can dodge an attack and quickly counter attack just seems out of place for a game like Silent Hill. It's no surprise this is the only game in the franchise to have anything like that.

So after all that, why am I recommending this game? I'm actually not, it's just when all you see are reviews that are mostly negative, giving another one will just get lost in the shuffle and won't benefit anyone when in fact there can be enjoyment found in this game if (HUGE if) you are willing to put in the work.

- En primera, el port a PC simplemente es un asco por dónde lo veas. Gritches, bugs y congelaciones de pantalla será el pan de cada día. El juego tiene necesidad de descargar un parche (hecho por fans) que haga que funcione relativamente ""decente"", pero ni aún así se logra salvar.
- En segunda; El mapeo de teclado y mando es literalmente una broma, ya que se resetea tras quitarse el menú donde configuraste éste mismo, en teclado está un poco aceptable su ubicación, pero vete  olvidando de conectar cualquier otro mando/control.
- En tercera; Pensaba que por no jugar las entregas ""clásicas"" del Team Silent mi opinión sería menos ""estricta"", sí es un tanto interesante lo que le ocurre al Alex, ya que es el prota, pero se ve que querían meter de a huevo otros temas como el culto o digamos, el mismo Silent Hll como ubicación junto con su ""castigador"" guiño, guiño.
- Cuarta y última; Vamos!!! tan siquiera le hubieran metido un poco más de ganas con la originalidad y variedad en sus monstruos.

No es un mal juego, gráficamente es como volver a jugar en ps3. Su historia esta muy interesante cuyo personaje principal tiene esa humanidad hacia los demás personajes secundarios. 

Al principio sus mecánicas como esquivar o defensa son un dolor de huevos, pero a la larga te vas a costumbrando, luego se te hace fácil seguir avanzando. Los acertijos no son nada de otro mundo pero lo pasas igual. 

No es un mal juego solo que esta optimizado muy pero muy mal, cuando empiezas a jugar luego de guardar y seguir avanzando este juego se te va cortar por primera vez. El juego se cierra y si no guardastes la partida fuiste a cargar y hacer todo otra vez. 

Luego cuando pasas de zona al finalizar la carga este se congela, y tenes que esperar unos 40 segundos o algunas veces 1 minuto. Y no me vengan a decir que no tengo pc para jugarlo porque no es eso, a mi me sobra la pc y el juego funciona muy mal. 

En cuanto a la resolución de pantalla se ve bien en 1440p PERO los mapas y los objetos se ven mal como si estuvieran agrandados por una sola parte y es un dolor de huevos ver le mapa de esa manera agrandado. Lo recomendable es que pongan una resolución original de 720p, es la única manera de jugarlo bien si que el mapa se deforme. 

En el sonido se escucha mal porque por defecto se queda clavado en 5.1 y yo no tengo parlantes 5.1 yo tengo parlantes 2.0 y se escucha para tuye.  Y en algunas partes del juego se cuelga algunos efectos de sonidos como puertas o los ruidos de los bichos. 
Otra es si te morís muchas veces el juego prácticamente se cierra para ahorrarte sufrimiento, y te lo digo por experiencia. 

No es un mal juego, pero esta muy mal optimizado y tiene muchos errores, por parte de la empresa responsable ni si quiera hay un parche que solucione estos problemas y no hay que ser experto de la nasa para darse cuenta que es notorio y frustrante jugar un juego así. 

Como siempre la comunidad sacando parches no oficiales para que podamos jugar bien a este juego, yo no baje ningun parche y lo jugue así como te lo venden roto y cree me que es un dolor de huevos jugarlo así pero se pudo jugar y llegar a la final.

Actually came back to complete this game despite being disappointed a year prior.  After patching game on a new system, the only issue I experienced was CTD's when trying to alt+tab out of the game.  Combat is jank, but its a remnant of the old school combat that was present in older silent hill games that in all honesty should be left behind in any upcoming SH reboots/remakes.  Outside of the combat and HEAVY reliance on Unknownproject's patch (and any bugs of course).  The gameplay and story themselves aren't too bad and it definitely kept the atmosphere the older SH games brought to the table.  I wouldn't say this game is a particularly great game- definitely not anywhere near the best in the series, but it's decent for what it is.  Buy only one sale as the price tag is laughable.

-Original Review Below-

Even with the patch the game is a buggy mess

After attempting multiple times to get past the sewer despite multiple crashes, police station enemies not registering being shot properly (may as well just use the axe exclusively), and overall reliance on the patch and having to re-download the game a couple of times due to issues with the saves not loading/causing crashes, decided to stop playing.  Hopefully one day Konami will remaster the game properly.  This is NOT worth the money in its current state, not even on sale.","[h1] Revised as of 5/24/2023 [/h1]

Pay close attention to the player character's face during cutscenes...it's uncanny, and quite frankly disgusting. He doesn't so much speak as mill grout about his fleshy maw in a completely unconvincing manner. Play at your own risk.   ""Scariest Mouths In The Game!/10"""

Honestly, the plot is quite interesting, but is done very poorly, it really doesn't help how there's not much expressions in the game, for instance the beginning when you're in the hospital and talking to Josh, your character is really much looking at the void instead of showing any emotion, confusion of the world around him.

But I shouldn't expect much from the game, after knowing Pyramid Head, oops I mean ""Bogeyman"" was added to the game, why? Fan-service that's why, the game only added him in to lure in old time fans as-well as people that know of Pyramid Head. 
If you want to see Pyramid Head, go for Silent Hill 2. You won't be disappointed, unless you're a modern gamer that can't handle old graphics. But just know you're missing out. Once you break that mindset you will love it, trust me on that.

For anyone that sees this review and is new to the Silent Hill franchise, I and many others recommend playing 1, 2 and 3 that were developed by Team Silent. They're the peak of the Silent Hill franchise as a whole. 
If you can't afford a Playstation 1, 2 or whatever old platform that has it. Emulate it. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to link places to find them, but I recommend searching online how to set one up. (always search for popular videos), and find places to get the games.

Though I will say, this game has an amazing soundtrack. But that's not a shocker since it's composed by Akira Yamaoka, and has really made the Silent Hill games from Amazing to Masterpieces. If you haven't heard of them, I suggest listening to them, it has a unique soundtrack that many horror games can never compete with.

But other than that, if you want the Real Silent Hill Experience, stick with Silent Hill 1-3, and if you enjoy those and want more, go for Silent Hill 4: The Room. 
Though I suggest staying away from anything over that. But if you want to experience them all go for it, but I recommend not expecting much, maybe keep expectations REALLY low, to maybe get a kick out of it.

It has all the good aspects of a horror game, difficult puzzles, eerie maps, monsters that can demolish you, and a story that I find pretty interesting. I know that this game is a port of the console version, but with a bit of tweaking it is very much playable on today's technology. 

The only downfall about this game is that there are tons of glitches within the game because it's a pretty mediocre port. The game will sometimes randomly crash during a loading screen (and if you didn't save its pretty annoying). Also some resolutions that claim to be supported break the game in some way so its best to play the game at 1080p 30fps. Because I played this game at 1440p 30fps, the maps in game ceased to function, they were way too zoomed in or cut off at parts. 

(Keep in mind there are a lot of bugs i'm not denying that, but none of them are game breaking in anyway other than the resolution problem. Most of the issues are on the graphical side of things and shouldn't bother you too much) 

Overall if you can tolerate a little bit of bugginess there is a ton of content in this game making it really enjoyable and game I always come back to from time to time.","Love this game, I fondly remember playing this in my childhood.

Joguei ele muito depois de seu lançamento, então talvez minha visão pareça quase como um revisionismo, visto que na época o game foi extremamente criticado.

Na minha opinião é tem um dos melhores enredos da franquia e a forte influência que o filme teve nele é um ponto positivo.

Gel gelelim bu oyunun berbat ötesi steam versiyonuna. Oyun bir kere 30 fps kilidi ile açılıyor. Normal şartlarda bu oyunu 60 fps çalıştırmanız mümkün değil. Bir kişinin yaptığı mod ile tekrar şans verip oynamak istedim ve 30 fps kilidini kaldırıp oyunu 60 fps ye çıkartabildim. Birde oyunun çok eskiden yapılan türkçe yaması mevcuttu onuda kurdum dedim ohh miss...

ama gerçekten bu konami çok ağır küfürleri hak ediyor. oyun sürekli çöküyor. belli belirsiz ne zaman olacağı belli olmadan bir anda masaüstüne atıyor sizi. tabi doğal olarak bu tür oyunların save sistemi biraz zor. otomatik olarak sizin son anınızı save etmiyor. siz nerede en son save yaptıysanız oradan başlayabiliyorsunuz oyuna.belki yarım saat önce son save noktasından başladığınız zaman bir hayli can sıkıcı oluyor.

Üstüne birde etrafınıza yaratıklar çıktığı zaman anlamsız bir biçimde oyun kasılmaya başlıyor baya baya 20-30 fps ye geri düşüyor sonra bu sıralarda tekrar masaüstüne geri atıyor oyun. Zaten mekaniksel açıdan çok başarılı bir oyun değil ama hikaye ve atmosfer yılına göre genede hakkını veriyor.

It is worth to play this game. The setting features many hells that many characters in this game carry in themselves. After you beat the game you should read about characters and how monsters came into being.


Crashes first... This game knows to crash while loading. To avoid this, you can exit the game to windows after every save. My best guess being that this is a port game, probably written in C++, and being that port is bad, there are memory leaks. Exiting the game allows your system to recover memory.
Employing this I saved myself from crashes... for now. I did not install any patch.
Don't alt-tab.


Savegames can get corrupted but in a positive way.
By loading Hotel Atrium and City Hall saves three times, I got all my health items, Health Drink, Medkit and Serums doubled, which I did exploit.


Nasty bug happens when enemy grapple you and there you have context icon flashing with buttons to save your self.
This did not work for Ferals and Asphyxia on my machine, meaning it is game over for me if grapple happens.


You can watch ""No Damage"" gameplays on YouTube to see tactics in action.
So youtube for Silent Hill Homecoming no damage gameplay.


For what reason did development team mix Silent Hill with Mortal Kombat I do not know, but game stopped being a horror game for me when I figured out how to kill stuff with the Knife. All other weapons are slow and leave you open to attack. The hotel was most disturbing for me, then Sewers, but there you can use one doorway, to defend agains Needlers which you can see in ""No Damage"" walkthroughs on YouTube.

Я люблю серию игр Тихого Холма и «Silent Hill: Homecoming» - не стала исключением. 
Игра явна не для всех, особенно , если ты и вовсе не знаком с Туманным городом Сайлент Хилл. 
Ощущение, что это лишь дополнение, а не основная игра. Сюжет - средний. Оптимизация - её нет вовсе - это единственное, что дико басит. А так: Музыка/атмосфера - топ. Дизайн локаций и рядовых противников монстров - средний, но вот сами Боссы и то как они выглядят - прост огонь/жуть как круто сделано. 
Опять же скажу, что игра не для всех. Она имеет огромный потенциал , но хренрвый фпс , оптимизация всё портит. (Поставил бы 7) 
Оцениваю игру на 5/10",
106271688,french,2021.11.22 08:44,❌,✅,0.4848484993,0,"So let's start.

Minus

- The game is literally unplayable for most part (This includes Crashes , freezes , lose of progress , bad controls , framerate issues follow by a 30 fps cap despite having option up to 144 hz in-game)
- Crashes : mostly happen at any time but shepherd house is a guaranteed crash zone, Hotel have a few , Silent Hill have a lot of them and some others than can in any zone.
- Have some soft-lock : One of them is in the church area. If you fast forward the cut button prompt on the three paintings the game will both cut and examine the paintings. Resulting in a guaranteed soft-lock requiring to restart the game.
- Framerate issue : the game is capped to 30 FPS despite the fact that the game literally have a 144 hz options. This can't be changed and require a patch to bypass the limit. There's also a large amount of framedrop in silent hill among shepherd's glen.
- Some loss of progress : Can happen randomly (I recommand a patch to avoid this).
- Lack of 10 stars ranking from the previous Silent Hill
- Controls have some issues : mouse sensitivity and controller can bug requiring to restart the game.
- Firearm gameplay (Simply inferior to previous installment and still inferior to games from the same era)

+

+ Soundtrack by Akira Yamaoka is good.
+ the multiple endings the game offer.
+ I like the story not as good as the previous 4 but remains more in line with 1-3 than 4 in my opinion.
+ Melee gameplay (The dodge system and different combo per weapons) 

This game is underrated and way better than his successor SIlent Hill Downpour which doesn't have a PC Port. This game is good on many aspects Konami preserved the multiples endings choices , the unique unlockables and some costumes which one can be unlock with Konami code. However i'm very dissapointed
that the 10 stars ranking system was removed. hard mode was made meaningless you don't unlock anything with it except a extra bonus scene at the end.

To conclude : Without a fan patch this game is unplayable and in a very bad state. He shouldn't be even sold. I'm even surprised no one even asked Konami to either fix it or start a lawsuit about it. No games even on PC should be sold like that because not everyone like fan patch (Like myself). This game have nothing for him even speedrunner can't run it.

To @KONAMI this is an insult to your players.

Edit : Can someone make patch for the game that fix FPS limit, fix crashes and controller compatibility. Without altering the game in any way like (Like the creatures health , difficulty , or costume making no damage like the change UnknownProject did.

I want the game working and no changemade to core gameplay at all.",

This is a TERRIBLE port of an at best mediocre game. If you are so inclined as to be a Silent Hill completionist, and you want to experience Homecoming, please pick this up for the console. I played it back when it came out on the Xbox 360, and I certainly do not have memories of struggling so hard to control Alex during combat - I tried on my keyboard and on my controller. 

The game is prone to crashing. Alt tab out? Crash. Watch a cutscene during the game? Crash. And if the game doesn't crash, it WILL freeze and you will think for a moment ""Oh crap, did I have a recent enough save?"" and then it will return to normal. I lost count on how many times this happened during my recent playthrough. 

Silent Hill has never been known for amazing combat, and there were MANY times while playing (due to this game deciding to lag or freeze) when I would release the trigger control (to aim with my weapon) and Alex will still be in attack mode like a total dope and it will take a while to get out of that stance.. but in the meantime enjoy some cheap hits from the different enemies in the game. It's dangerous because there are a couple who can one shot you if you stink at quicktime events with button pressing. 

The amount that this game is listed for is ballsy. I picked this up on a sale of 75% off (I think) and I still overpaid. I should have just ebayed a 360 copy. Seriously - play this on console, not this terrible PC port.","Whew boy. Where do I begin?

Silent Hill Homecoming é um jogo feito pela Double Helix Games e publicado pela Konami em 2008 para Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 e PC. O jogo conta a história de Alex Shepherd depois de voltar a sua cidade natal, Shepherd's Glen, a partir daí ele descobre que seu pai e seu irmão desapareceram sem deixar nenhum rastro, e a partir daí, ele precisa reencontrar os dois, no entanto, coisas estranhas vão acontecendo na cidade, e aí a história começa a se desenrolar, com ele parando em Silent Hill tempos depois, e começando de verdade o jogo.

O jogo é até bacana, apesar de sua jogabilidade e controles terem mudado muito em relação aos seus títulos antecessores da franquia, com agora o jogo lembrando até mais o Resident Evil 4 do que os Silent Hill's (minha opinião), isso não faz do jogo ruim, só o faz diferente dos outros, principalmente no aspecto de câmera, com agora a câmera seguindo o jogador, ao invés daquela câmera fixa que ia alternando quando você mudava de um lugar para o outro. A trilha sonora, assim como a dos outros jogos, é sensacional (Akira Yamaoka é Akira Yamaoka né pai?). A história é até bacana, os gráficos, apesar de pra época já serem meio meh (levando em conta que era um jogo para a 7a geração de consoles), ainda sim dá para relevar, no entanto, há alguns (no caso muitos) problemas.

O jogo em si é até bacana, no entanto, para um jogo que é da série Silent Hill, esperava mais. O jogo não me deu susto algum, diferente dos outros que chegavam a me dar pesadelos. Algumas coisas da história são bem previsíveis, no entanto, o jogo continua sendo divertido mesmo com essas coisas. Agora, o que mais me incomodou foi a otimização dessa joça aqui: O JOGO É MAL OTIMIZADO DEMAIS, E CHEIO DE FALHAS!

Esse jogo é completamente injogável no PC (diferente das versões dos consoles que dá para jogar tranquilamente), o jogo crasha quando você dá alt+tab e volta para o jogo, as vezes, quando você coloca um fix e consegue executar tamanha vigarice, o jogo cai de 60FPS para incríveis 7FPS. O jogo crasha quando eu mudo para a minha resolução nativa não sei porque, aí eu preciso ficar jogando o jogo em 720p (isso aconteceu comigo, não sei com outras pessoas), o áudio do jogo as vezes só funciona de um lado do headset, isso incomoda E MUITO em muitas ocasiões, mas o pior mesmo é a questão de saves do jogo: as vezes, quando você coloca um patch fix para consertar o jogo e inicia ele, o jogo simplesmente crasha. Mesmo no new game, a mesma coisa acontece, é um negócio bizonho. Enfim, o problema do jogo é que ele não só é mal otimizado, como também ele é cheio de bugs e crashes bizarros.

Enfim, o jogo é até legal, tem pontos até desafiantes (apesar do jogo ser beeem mais fácil que os primeiros), mas fica bem abaixo dos outros da franquia (obviamente), mas dá até para jogar de boa se for num console. O maior problema, no entanto, é a versão de PC. Não pegue esse jogo para PC de jeito nenhum, o jogo tem texturas que ficam piscando (flickando) em alguns lugares, o áudio dos diálogos só funciona de um lado do headset, os loadings são bem demorados (bizarramente), e também há muitos bugs e crashes que persistem mesmo com fixes (inclusive se você der alt+tab durante o jogo, o jogo crasha ou a framerate cai drasticamente durante a gameplay). A Konami nem se importou de otimizar esse jogo para PC. Além disso, é uma grande tristeza que não tem os outros Silent Hills para Steam, deveria ter, pois faz muita falta.

Minha nota para o jogo é: 5/10 (levando em conta sua otimização e que eu perdi 2 horas de jogo devido a crashes, vlw Konami, sua preguiçosa!)",

The above sentence is what I initially published out of sheer frustration, before finishing the game. Now that I have finished it, I can safely say that this is one of the worst Silent Hill games, to the point where I feel repulsed even calling it one. It misunderstands a great deal of what the series stands for, and doesn't bring much new to the table.

Let's start with the graphics. They look noticeably worse than Silent Hill 3, a game that came out a whole console generation before this one. Most character models have something off about them, and not in the uncanny horror sense. There were also some scenes where the lighting was really messed up, which to my surprise was not just a byproduct of this PC port. I guess some of the environments are fine, but I never really got the same feel from them that I did from the original Silent Hill games.

Even if we disregard any technical aspects, the presentation is just weak. The devs clearly took inspiration from the Silent Hill movie, and some of its visually interesting aspects are faithfully recreated, but everything else pales in comparison to what the series was doing nearly a decade prior. The series' signature otherworld sections have this weird metallic lava aesthetic which is more akin to Bowser's castle than the psychological hellscapes of previous entries. The enemy design is also very hit or miss, with only some of the boss designs being truly remarkable. The story is not only mediocre, but it could actually dampen your enjoyment of other SH games if you choose to play this first.

The gameplay is probably what separates this the most from the older games in terms of deliberately doing something different, but all it amounts to is a clunky, exploitable combat system and a heap of late 2000s gameplay tropes. So if you're a huge fan of QTEs, sloppy item wheels that make you accidentally waste items, and dodge rolling, then I guess there's something for you here.

In closing, I want to acknowledge the one truly good thing here: the music. Series veteran Akira Yamaoka's soundtrack may make you momentarily forget how bad of an experience this is. That is, if you can hear any of it, because the audio mixing is also terrible.","One of the most horribly broken PC ports I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with, even with patches.

No caso desse SH Homecoming sim, temos todos os elementos que fizeram o sucesso da franquia. Ambientes fechados, sombrios, cheio de portas trancadas, puzzles para acessar outros ambientes, criaturas estranhas, ruas sob neblina, terror psicológico e enredo misterioso. Até a música é característica da série. Eu diria que depois do terceiro SH, esse é o que mais faz jus a série, até mais que Silent Hill 4 : The room. Mas nem esses detalhes salvam o jogo de alguns problemas, e o primeiro deles é o inovador sistema de combate, focado bastante nas armas de ataque corpo a corpo. O que era pra ser uma evolução na franquia, acaba se transformando, por vezes, num fator de frustração. Contando com um sistema de esquiva e ataque mais forte (e também mais lento) muitas vezes mais atrapalham que ajudam. É preciso ter um ""time"" mais apurado pra se beneficiar desse sistema, sob pena de sofrer dano antes de acertar as criaturas.  Por conta desse novo sistema de combate do protagonista, a curva de adaptação a ele pode ser um pouco mais demorado e frustrar a jogatina, já que os ataques das criaturas também foram aprimorados. O outro problema são os gráficos. Não por ter uma paleta de cores quase monocromática, mas por ter texturas e detalhes muito pobres, principalmente se comparado a outros jogos da época. Quanto a história, nada excepcional, onde temos um a volta do filho pródigo a cidade natal, e a busca por parte desse, pelo seu irmão desaparecido. O jogo sofreu forte (e positiva) influência do filme lançado em 2006 - baseado na franquia - chamado ""Terror em Silent Hill"". Recomendo aos fãs, já que nos faz lembrar de bons e saudosos momentos da série. No fim das contas é um bom jogo, mas pra quem não conhece o universo de Silent Hill, não é o melhor cartão de visitas.",

Po prostu gra odstaje od poprzednich części. Nie jest to gniot, ale gdyby w nazwie nie było SH pewnie i oceny byłyby niższe..  w każdym razie- fabuła jest całkiem ok, nasz bohater wraca do rodzinnego miasteczka i od razu odkrywa, że coś jest nie tak. No i przede wszystkim zaginął jego młodszy brat..

Oprawa audiowizualna jest ok, o ile mamy w pamięci, że gra ma ponad 10 lat.

Na pewno irytuje system walki.. jak i ogólnie sterowanie. To nigdy nie była mocna strona serii, ale w tej odsłonie, niby projekcja płaszczykiem innowacji w zakresie ruchów bohatera, gra się momentami naprawdę topornie.

Po napisach końcowych miałem wrażenie, że Homecoming to delikatna kopia SH2. Jasne, można napisać, że Double Helix inspirowało się początkiem serii, ale ja bardziej odniosłem wrażenie braku pomysłu i ogólnie wtórności. Dlatego ta gra jest.. średnia. Po ukończeniu jej kilka lat temu już do niej na pewno nie wrócę. Ale biorąc pod uwagę plusy i minusy tej gry ostatecznie daję kciuka w górę.

Za pełną cenę odradzam zakup. Będziecie zawiedzeni, nawet jeśli jesteście wielkimi fanami Cichego Wzgórza. W promocji za ok. 30 zł- już tak.

Jakby nie było, konkurencja w postaci Resident Evil chyba wygrała. Co prawda są jakieś plotki o wskrzeszeniu serii, ale ostatecznie kończy się to niczym konkretnym. Mimo wszystko, liczę na to, że Konami jeszcze raz zaprosi nas do Silent Hill. Do tego czasu pozostają nam wyprawy do Racoon City..",

It's quite clear, especially looking back, that this was a cash grab with very little effort put into making it a good game.  Example: you need two halves of a symbol in order to unlock a door.  The second half of the symbol is literally found mere feet away from the locked door.  Why not just have the door require one item if that's where you're going to put the second half?  Lazy design.

Combat is clunky and difficult.  You're supposed to be able to dodge enemy attacks and then counter attack but it's much harder in practice than in theory.  

Atmosphere: the game simply isn't dark enough.  You're given a flashlight but you'll hardly need it.  This robs the game of the atmosphere and of revealing the unknown with your light.

Level Design: not good.  The game is extremely linear even though it presents a facade of being open.  For example in the hotel there's basically just one path forward, sometimes there are rooms you can enter but they're almost always empty and every room looks exactly the same as the others.  ""This bed is really dirty"" is the protagonist's thoughts with every bed in the game, etc.  I understand technical limitations probably limit creativity but at least make some of the rooms look different or throw in a couple of health drinks for those that took the time to explore.  I realize Silent Hill 1 and 2 did this but they were dealing with hardware limitations that this game shouldn't have been so hamstrung by.  

Sound: Terrible.  Even while wearing a headset you can't locate enemies by sound alone, it'll either sound like they're coming from the left side or the right side even if they're dead ahead of you.  Also applies to cut scenes.  Very poorly optimized sound.  

On to technical issues, I didn't get the crashing that so many others experience as long as I didn't Alt-Tab.  If I did Alt-Tab the game would crash.  For some reason my down movement key didn't work, at all, which became a real problem when I encountered the first boss.  Didn't care enough to troubleshoot or find a workaround.  Game ran fairly smoothly other than that, with settings turned up high, occasional hitching during cut scenes but nothing major.  

Disappointed that I bought this because I'm past the refund window but I'm also just done playing.  It isn't fun or atmospheric, the story is somewhat interesting but I don't care to slog through the awful combat and controls to unearth more of it (since I've forgotten most of it after 13 years).","I played this when it first came out on PS3 and even then I wasn't blown away, but I'm a sucker for all things Silent Hill so I decided to replay it on PC.

pasando a los puntos en contra, lamentablemente si es un muy mal port para la pc, en este caso si hay ocasiones en las que el juego se congela por momentos en especial a la hora de guardar o cuando pasas en algunas secciones, no puedes minimizarlo porque de hacerlo este juego inmediatamente se cierra y bueno si no guardaste tendras que pasar todo de nuevo, sin embargo es jugable puede que algunos dado su constumbre a que los juegos vayan fluidos todo el tiempo les puede ser frustrante pero siendo sinceros tengan algo de paciencia y dejense sumergir por su mundo.

como pequeño dato adiccional jugue esto con un control de XboxOne, recomiendo mucho jugarlo con control desconozco como es con el teclado y mause pero se que es algo incomodo, asi que por su comodidad jueguenlo con control

otra cosa más es que disfruten del juego y den gracias que tengamos una version para steam, esperemos pronto  o de alguna manera podamos seguir jugando más titulos de la franquicia legalmente gracias a Steam, sin más que agregar se los recomiendo  mucho aun con sus contras, vale la pena totalmente este titulo, solo dejense llevar y disfruten del mismo",

+The atmosphere is well done
+Combat feels nice
+Seems to be pretty well written for the most part. The documents and whatnot feel like they are from a silent hill game.
+Has music and sound effects by Akira Yamaoka, which is part of what makes the series IMO. 
+I’m not sure if the OG art director Masahiro Ito was involved, but judging by what feels like clear inspiration from Jacob’s Ladder, they must have done their homework.  

Cons:

-Technical Issues
-Not quite the same vibe as the originals
-No auto saves, which normally would be okay but since it can be prone to crash, it can be a pain.
-Seems like a little too much focus on combat

O que eu quero dizer é: Não paguem por esse port, baixem p1r4t4 ou joguem outra versão. Eu tive dores de cabeça ao longo de toda gameplay, desde o cemitério de Shepherd's Glenn, nos Sewers e a parte final foi a que mais me irritou de longe por causa de inúmeros crashes, só pra ter uma ideia eu tive que matar a p0h4 do último boss 3 VEZES. Acredito que 3 horas do que joguei foi só porque tive que refazer os cenários, a sorte é que tem bastante saves no jogo. 

Já vi que a coisa ia ficar tensa nos primeiros 2 minutos de gameplay quando percebi que o framerate estava limitado a 30 e só tinha 2 opções pra perfomance de jogo. Medium e High. Nem preciso dizer que em vários lugares esses frames caíam abruptamente, chegou a bater 9 fps nos Sewers essa é de longe a pior parte do jogo, trava muuuuito e infelizmente é obrigatório passar por lá, mas por um lado é uma parte curta. 

Outra coisa negativa: O jogo crashava sempre que eu mudava de janela. Pelo menos acontecia com frequência, então eu evitava ao máximo. Eu não podia pausar o jogo e ir dar uma olhada no twitter, por exemplo, se não o jogo podia crashar e isso é extremamente irritante e chato.  

Eu ainda não te convenci a não comprar? vamos lá...

Comandos do jogo NÃO funcionam direito. As vezes é preciso mais de um click pra se ter uma resposta, eu passei perrengue por causa de um quick time event onde o jogo não contava o botão direito do mouse, as vezes o personagem não desviava dos golpes (apesar de que parte desse problema é culpa da hitbox dos inimigos) e você precisa sair do ""shift"" pra acessar o inventario, acredite isso vai fazer você perder vida se tiver em combate. Também os puzzles ficam mais confusos de se resolver, eles não foram bem adaptados pro mouse então clique onde for e reze pra mover alguma peça e saber o que está fazendo.

Falando sobre o jogo, eu até gostei dele. Esperava menos e algumas coisas me surpreenderam positivamente como a história que é simples, porém boa, trás referências diretas ao primeiro jogo e também segue a fórmula de simbologias e tem uma atmosfera mediana, dá pra ficar tensa com o ambiente em certos lugares e isso foi o que eu mais gostei nele. 

E é isso, apesar de ter mais pontos ruins que bons, esse port tem concerto por causa de toda a paciência e boa vontade de terceiros. A Double Helix não deu a f0d4 pro jogo e lançou essa bomba aí de qualquer jeito. Então meu conselho é esse, baixe em outro lugar, aplique o patch de correção e ai você não precisa mais perder a sanidade jogando. É isso.",

Mas o maior problema que eu tive foram os absurdos slows durante várias partes do jogo ou quando ia salvar, meu Deus as vezes se passavam MINUTOS antes de conseguir destravar.

Every single aspect of this game: gameplay, visuals, narrative, overall presentation, et cetera, is so deeply flawed that I struggle to even grasp for straws of positive traits. The fact that some in the fanbase continue to defend Homecoming perplexes me. Knowing that Konami canceled Team Silent's Silent Hill 5 for this infuriates me. Naturally, all of this is a result of Konami commissioning Double Helix Games, a studio that had never made a game prior, to do the job, alongside Konami's demands that they modernize the series to fit with industry trends. Of course, this is not entirely Double Helix's fault, but also due to total mismanagement of the project on Konami's part. This is a spoiler review, so please be warned.

Firstly, the story. You are Alex Shepherd, a soldier coming back from the war to his town of Shepherd's Glen, a town neighboring Silent Hill. Strangely, your hometown is shrouded in a thick fog and people have gone missing. This isn't to mention the numerous ripped-off and unoriginal monsters roaming the streets. He finds his mother in a catatonic state and she tells him that his brother Joshua has gone missing. Unfortunately, this interesting premise is utterly wasted by the dumbfounding writing in this game. The game does absolutely nothing interesting with the soldier premise, never bothering to explore the trauma that could arise from fighting others in a war-torn nation. Alex's PTSD is never explored and the monster designs, manifested from his subconscious, never reflect this. More on this later. The supporting cast isn't much better, with love interest Elle Holloway being little more than that, a childhood love interest with no depth or development. Deputy Wheeler is little more than a minor black cop stereotype who sometimes helps out in combat. Margaret Holloway, the game's main antagonist doesn't even show her true colors as the villain until the cutscene you kill her (in a quick-time event, naturally). The only character I found interesting was Adam Shepherd, Alex's father. Adam naturally is a horrible person, but I feel like he had the most depth of the cast. When you do learn of the situation he was forced into and how he speaks of it afterward, it does make you consider if he genuinely feels remorse or is simply trying to save face. Adam isn't a great character by any means but he's the only one with some sort of depth. This lack of developed or memorable characters makes it hard to connect to the game's narrative and as a result, I found myself not really caring whether Alex and company survived. This isn't even to mention how the game just drops a braindead plot twist on you at the last minute. Alex was never a soldier and just came up with this ridiculously convoluted backstory to cope with Joshua's death. I find this to be the most egregious part of the game's narrative since it wastes the only interesting part of it: the premise. Throwing out a genuinely interesting story hook for a stupid bait-and-switch plot twist is the biggest mistake of this game. It makes all of the symbolism in the game feel completely disconnected from Alex and they feel like monsters in a void rather than manifestations from his psyche. It's just poorly written, predictable, and boring.

Homecoming was the first ""next-gen"" Silent Hill title, so naturally, at the very least you would expect some pretty visuals to go with it. This is false, unfortunately. Homecoming just reeks of budget constraints, and almost every part of this game's visuals feels cheap. Environments are generally rendered fine. They're large and detailed, even if they suffer from poor texture work. Character models are really ugly and suffer from a severe uncanny valley effect. They tend to have puppet facial animation and chunky, polygonal hair that seems to have matted together into one giant clump. The game also suffers from a severe case of asset reuse. I wouldn't be able to count on one hand the number of times the same corpse model is used over and over again. The game also has next to no graphics options, with only a resolution setting and a general quality option, the former of which is a bit redundant for me as the map and inventory break at resolutions higher than 1080p. The lack of any real video settings such as anti-aliasing or anisotropic filtering is unacceptable for a PC game from 2008, even if you can force them externally. The game is also unoptimized as all hell, even on a modern PC rig. Firstly, it's capped at 30fps, but using mods to unlock it produces an unstable framerate that goes from 165fps to 20fps based on the area. The game is also very unstable even with mods seeking to alleviate the issue. It has crashed on me numerous times and while I never lost a significant amount of progress, that didn't make it any less unacceptable.

From an art direction standpoint, Homecoming feels uninspired. It feels like Double Helix's art team diluted Silent Hill's aesthetic to the most Hollywood-esque marketable style, and makes it feel more like fire and brimstone rather than a surrealist hellscape. The monster designs feel uninspired, the ones that are new that is. Plenty of them are almost entirely ripped from previous games. The smogs are just lying figures. The nurses are just from the film. Believe it or not, Pyramid Head even makes a brief yet frustrating experience. Even if you ignore Homecoming's cheap technical appearance, it doesn't even offer interesting visuals on paper.

Double Helix set out to make Homecoming's combat more intuitive than the previous five games, all of which were criticized to some degree in that regard. Comedically, they somehow made it even less intuitive! Homecoming's combat is incredibly frustrating. The simple fact that the game's main mechanic is stunlocking, something which is considered an exploit in most games, is so hysterically absurd. Hysterical, of course, until you actually have to play it. I played on hard mode, as I usually do with games, and was surprised with how little room the game gives for failure. Enemies have much quicker reaction times than you do and have a much easier time stunlocking you than the player can ever hope to achieve. Enemy attacks are also poorly telegraphed, making it hard to determine when it's best to attack and when it's best to retreat, which is especially frustrating since the nurses have an instant one-hit-kill attack. Dodgerolling isn't as useful as it should be, as some game designers thought it was an absolutely brilliant idea to give the player no invincibility frames, defeating the entire point of an evasive maneuver. Enemies are also total bullet sponges, eating up your ammunition and taking absurd amounts of melee attacks to kill. That would be fine in a survival horror game, but Homecoming is action horror, and therefore it feels counterintuitive. Puzzle-wise, the game puts in little effort. It feels like they're just there for the sake of it rather than genuinely wanting to make the player think, as they are all insanely easy. Some of them are even sliding block puzzles. Yeah.

Silent Hill: Homecoming spits in the face of everything the franchise stands for. The story is generic and poorly written, the gameplay is frustrating and unintuitive, and the game itself is held together by duct tape. It's really not worth playing at all, even if you're a diehard Silent Hill fan. If you absolutely must play it, play it with Unknownproject's Patch, or on a console where crashes are less of an issue.","I have never before played a game that is so relentlessly frustrating in every single area of production.

The game crashes far too easily, so if you made progress? Be sure to cry over the fact that you did and lost it.

The game does run for me at 1080p but certain items like the in-game map (which if you know Silent Hill, is at least a little important) don't work right.  So I'm running the game at 720p, still a big upgrade from console.  I did have to edit the cfg file to set the resolution without crashing, if you know nothing about computers that might scare you, but it took me less than a minute to fix.

I have had a couple of crashes (other than changing the resolution in game) but only 1 was during any kind of gameplay and the others were when the game went to reload the save after my death. Took 2 seconds to restart the game and continue playing.

I have been getting a few lag spikes, usually when first entering a new area, I did have one of those crash but I was also spamming buttons which might have triggered a ""not responding"" crash.  The other spikes I've managed just to wait out 1-2 seconds and then there's no more trouble until the next area.

These tech issues might bother some but I routinely play games that are ""old"" and almost none of them work 100% correctly and there are some even on GOG that require some workarounds, so they don't bother me any.

Another ""old game"" issue is the controls... I've always called these ""tank"" controls... because it feels like you are driving a tank, pretty similar to things like Resident Evil 1,2 and Silent Hill 1,2,3, and well a lot of games at the time. So with a gamepad at least I'm not really having any trouble with the controls, mouse and keyboard probably is worse... but I don't see it as a unique problem to Homecoming.

As far as the game it self, I personally think for the age that it looks great, runs decent and is an underrated game.  Sure its not any of those fantastic games I mentioned earlier... but I would still call it a good game.  While I wouldn't say it does anything perfectly, it does very much look, sound and feel like a Silent Hill game.  

Homecoming is certainly not Resident Evil, it's not Outlast, it's not Amnesia, it's not Evil Within... and to me, that's a great thing because there's just nothing else out there with this very specific Silent Hill style.

Na minha opinião, este é o último Silent Hill que bebe naquele estilo do 1, 2 e 3 e Origins (o 4, o Shattered Memories e o Downpour têm propostas diferentes). Aqui você vai se sentir em Silent Hill de novo.

Homecoming não é o melhor dos jogos da série, mas a sua maior qualidade é ter a essência da saga nele. Vagar pela cidade sem saber para onde tem que ir. Sirenes. Silêncio. Olhar para o mapa milhares de vezes. Correr de alguma criatura bizarra que apareceu do nada. Este jogo pode ser considerado um Silent Hill ""raiz"". 

A história é interessante: o soldado Alex Shepherd volta à sua cidade natal para descobrir o que aconteceu com o seu irmão e, bem, sua mãe está... estranha quanto a isso, e seu pai sumiu. Acontecem reviravoltas, encontros e desencontros e Alex acaba em Silent Hill.

A jogabilidade, agora reforçada por controlarmos um soldado, é mais focada na pancadaria, nas esquivas, nos tiros - Alex é o personagem mais badass da franquia - e pode não agradar algumas pessoas. Eu particularmente achei legal essa nova maneira de encarar Silent Hill.

O único e principal problema desse jogo são os CRASHS. Eu quase desisti de terminar esse jogo por isso. É crash no salvamento, é crash na troca de ângulo da câmera, é crash em batalha com boss. Faltou um fio de cabelo para a minha experiência com o jogo ter sido arruinada. A única coisa que salvou minha gameplay foi baixar um patch que ajudou um pouco nos problemas. Dá uma procurada pelo Google que você acha ele fácil - ele é essencial para você jogar.

No mais, é um bom jogo. Na minha opinião, o último decente da saga. Silent Hill Homecoming me fez voltar àquela sensação de ter 16 anos novamente jogando Silent Hill 1 em meu PSOne. Que saudade.",

È stato il primo della serie che giocai. Ero ancora piccolo e inesperto, e non avendo ancora giocato gli altri all'epoca mi parve un bel gioco con una trama carina e delle atmosfere horror da paura. Rivedendolo adesso, con la consapevolezza maturata negli anni, quello che posso dire è che è un gioco che non si merita assolutamente il nome di Silent Hill e che non consiglierei nemmeno al mio peggior nemico. Il videogioco si discosta molto dai canoni originali della serie in quanto è stato sviluppato da un team americano. Ispirandosi enormemente al primissimo film di Silent Hill hanno tirato fuori un prodotto con del fanservice ingiustificato, inserendo all'interno del gioco mostri come [i]Pyramid Head[/i], il quale non ha nulla a che fare con il protagonista, giusto per far urlare il pubblico più generalista che magari si è avvicinato al videogioco proprio dopo aver visto il film.
Il [b]level design[/b] è scandaloso, aree composte interamente da corridoi da far percorrere ai giocatori che tolgono totalmente quel brivido di scoperta dato dall'esplorazione. Per non parlare della città poi, molto più vuota e noiosa da esplorare rispetto agli altri capitoli della serie. 
Ma ora parliamo del tasto più dolente del gioco a mio parere, il [b]combat system[/b]. A differenza degli altri giochi qui troviamo un combattimento più action, cosa non per forza negativa se il loro scopo era quello di attirare gente fuori dalla nicchia già creatasi. Il problema è che andando avanti sempre di più nel gioco e incontrando nuovi mostri ci si accorge che l'unica cosa che ne ricaviamo da esso è frustrazione. Schivare correttamente i colpi dei nemici sembra più sia dovuto a pura fortuna che altro in quanto gli attacchi dei mostri sono spesso poco prevedibili e le hit box sono poco precise. E questo non porta ad altro che frustrazione e rabbia, più che alla paura che ci aspetteremmo da un gioco simile, ogni qualvolta ci si presenta davanti un mostro da sconfiggere. Parlando del [b]comparto tecnico[/b] invece troviamo sia cose positive che negative. Graficamente il gioco si presenta discretamente per il tempo in cui è stato sviluppato. Purtroppo però le animazioni facciali dei personaggi non risultano sempre convincenti, risultando spesso legnose e finte.

Andando invece ora a parlare dei pochi lati positivi di questo titolo possiamo dire che la [b]trama[/b] ha qualche sprazzo di originalità. Infatti seppur la messa in scena non sia assolutamente delle migliori, la storia risulta un minimo coinvolgente e interessante. 
Altri fattori positivi sono le [b]musiche[/b], composte dall'amatissimo Akira Yamaoka, e i [b]design[/b] dei mostri, alcuni a mio parere molto ispirati e spaventosi (come ad esempio il boss [i]Asphyxia[/i]).

Infine, parliamo del [b]porting[/b] per PC: l'ho rigiocato utilizzando direttamente la patch di [i]unknownproject[/i] in quanto avevo provato la versione vanilla anni fa e ne ero rimasto disgustato. Paragonabile al porting originale del primo Dark Souls. Una vera porcheria buttata qui su Steam giusto per.
Fortunatamente esiste la patch sopracitata che risolve la maggior parte dei problemi (non tutti purtroppo). Grazie ad essa ho potuto giocare in 21:9 in 1440p con un framerate sbloccato. Purtroppo però sono presenti numerosi cali, soprattutto nei momenti più concitati, anche utilizzando hardware assolutamente performante. In più i crash sono ancora presenti, sia quelli randomici sia quelli fissi che succedono ogni qualvolta si decida di alt-tabbare il gioco.

In [b]conclusione[/b], seppur non sia completamente da buttare, ne sconsiglio assolutamente l'acquisto.",

Olumlu özellikleri
+ Her ne kadar Team Silent ekibinin yaptığı oyunların hikayesi kadar iyi bir hikayesi olmasa da gayet güzel ve sonu süprizli bir hikayeye sahip.
+ Müzikleri çok güzel.
+ Bazı bölümlerin tasarımları ortam sesleri ile karıştığı zaman insanı ürkütüyor. 

Olumsuz Özellikleri

- Fan pack kursanız dahi hatrı sayılır miktarda bug ile oynamaya mecbursunuz. Ben pack kurmadan steam hali ile oynamak istiyorum diyorsanız kolay gelsin. Oyundan atma, grafik bozulması, özellikle puzzle sırasında fare algılamaması ve save algılamama/silme gibi hatalar ile başa çıkmak zorundasınız. Pack sadece karşılaşma ihtmalinizi biraz düşürüyor o kadar.
- Save noktaları birbirine çok uzak. Normalde sorun etmem ama bazı zamanlar oyundan atınca hatrı sayılı bir zamanı tekrar oynamak zorunda kalıyorsunuz.
- O nasıl bir combat sistemidir ya. Canavarla boğuşmaktan ve mermi/can ayarı yapmaktan çok combat sistemi sizi yoruyor. 
- İlginç bir şekilde bıçak ile baltanın ve diğer yakın dövüş silahlarının hasarı aynı...  Bari bunu düzgün yapsaydınız.
- Komik bir şekilde yanınızda çok az mermi taşıyabiliyorsunuz. Örnek olarak tabancanın içindeki dahil 3 şarjör merminiz oluyor.",

The level design and plot are definitely the weakest of the series, with many of the enemies being poorly though out or rip offs from other games in the series and the puzzles are also sub-par. The only exception to this is the prison which really deserves to be part of a better game. 
A large part of the combat is also built around a dodge mechanic, which might have been enjoyable if the engine was responsive enough for it to work properly, or the enemies attack speed was based on the actual dodge system rather than what the designers wanted it to be. Instead you will almost always get hit when dodging and many enemies will repeatedly dodge or block your attacks. Ive died several times in boss fights getting stuck in a loop of attempt doge, get hit, attempt dodge, get hit, attempt dodge, fall down and repeat until dead.
This game is also horrifically optimised for PC, items and maps dont render correctly above 720p despite in engine support. Despite playing on a high end system load times seem to be the same as on PS3/360 and the game freezes for a few seconds 95% of the time when: opening the save menu, closing the save menu, loading a video, exiting a video, loading a new area and having loaded a new area, as well as random freezes throughout. The game also has a habit of crashing on death, making the games checkpoints useless.

Instead of wasting £18 on this game, try to track down a PS2 and Silent Hill 1-4, even at 10x the price it will be better value for money. Alternatively pirate Silent Hill 1-4 and play them that way, as Im sure serving 10 years for copyright infringement would be more enjoyable than playing Homecoming.","Possibly the worst Silent Hill game of them all, certainly worse than any of the numbered entries (my play time is largely down to the amount of time I left the game paused and walked away).

This game has the atmosphere and spirit of a Silent Hill game along with an Amazing soundtrack and the last game composed by the great Akira Yamaoka
But the story and characters are heavily flawed,boring and flat at their best and unoriginal and lacking at their worst.
For the first American Silent Hill game you can tell that they try their hardest to pay respect and homage to all the work that came before and that is no easy task to say the least
People seem to have a problem with this games combat for which i genuinely cannot understand especially if you've played the original trilogy it's still as stiff and clunky as before
It's a different take and can be fun,An improvement though? I'm not so sure.......
Thanks to a fan who is passionate about fixing this abhorrent PC port the game can now be played in 4K resolutions and at 60 fps but CAUTION
ONLY PICK THIS GAME UP ON SALE OR THROUGH A SITE but that shouldn't really have to be said hahaha but still its one  of the reasons people could be detracted from trying it out but you could do something worse with 5 dollars (on sale) ,Konami sucks and its a shame
All ramblings aside,Hope you check it out.

90952710,turkish,2021.03.26 17:43,✅,✅,0.5238095522,1,"En başta belirtmeliyim ki, Silent Hill'den çok Silent Hill'e benzeyen bir yapım olmuş. Bu ismi kullanmak yerine farklı bir isimde çıkış yapsalardı, eminim daha çok sevilen bir oyun olurdu.

Karakterimiz Alex Shepherd savaşta yara almış bir özel kuvvetler askeridir. Yaralarının iyileşmesi için hastanede tedavi gören Alex, doğduğu yer olan Shepherd's Glen'e babası ve kardeşinin kaybolduğunu duyduktan sonra geri dönme kararı almıştır. Ancak eve vardığında annesinin de garip davranışları ve nörolojik bir takım bozukluklarının olduğunu fark etmiştir. Annesinden istediği cevapları alamayan Alex, Shepherd's Glen içinde kendi çabalarıyla kardeşini aramaya başlayacaktır.

Çıktığı yıl göz önünde bulundurulduğunda oldukça tatmin edici bir grafik yapısı olduğunu belirtmeliyim. Çevre ve karakter modellemeleri oldukça başarılı. Oyun atmosferi hissettirmeyi başarıyor. Ayrıca çevredeki bir çok ögeyle etkileşime girebiliyor olmak da, oyunun ayrıca artılarından biri olmuş.

Oynanış tarafıysa aslında bütün sıkıntının başladığı yer olarak karşımıza çıkıyor. Silent Hill oyunu olmasını bir tarafa koyacak olursak; bir psikolojik gerilim oyunu için fazlasıyla aksiyon bulunduruyor. Bu durum, toplamda 5-6 yaratık modellemesi ve vuruş hissi kötü olan bir oyun için oynanışı oldukça rutinleştiriyor ve en önemlisi korku hissiyatını oldukça azaltıyor. Hal böyleyken bir de mücadele tarafının basitliği ve geri kalmışlığı durumu iyice kötü bir kıvama getiriyor. Çoğu yaratık ile savaşırken sadece öldürene kadar düz vuruş yapmanız gerekiyor; karşılık veremiyorlar ve öldürmenizi bekliyorlar. Bazı yaratıklar ise fazla güçlü olduğu için anlamsızca fazla zaman harcamanızı gerektiriyor. Şahsen bu şekilde bir aksiyon tarafı yapacaklarına, hiç bir aksiyon ögesi olmadan sadece yürümeye yönelik bir oyun üretselerdi, olduğu halinden daha başarılı bir yapım olacağını düşünüyorum.

Oynanış tarafında ayrıca yeni bir özellik var ki, diğer serilere göre kendini farklı göstermeyi başarıyor. Oyun 'metroidvania' tarzına bürünmüş. Edindiğimiz silahlar sayesinde, önceden önünden açamadan geçtiğimiz kapıları geri dönerek açmamız ve oradan ilerlememiz gerekebiliyor. Şahsen oyuna farklı bir tat kattığını söyleyebilirim.

Oyundaki bulmaca sayısının az ama basit olmadığını da belirtmeliyim. Bu konuda serinin önceki oyunlarını aratmıyor.

Silent Hill Homecoming için söylenebilecek en can sıkıcı tarafsa, bir çok bug ve optimizasyon sıkıntılarının bulunmasıdır sanırım. Baştan sona uzun bekleme süreleri, durduk yere olan takılma ve çökmeler ve tabii ki buglarıyla yapım, fazlasıyla diken üstünde oynamanıza neden oluyor. Kayıt noktaları arasında genel anlamda fazla mesafe olduğu için, bir süre ilerleyip kaydetme noktası bulamadığınızda; herhangi bir çökmeye denk gelmemek için endişelenmeye başlıyorsunuz. Bu durum da oyuncuyu, oyunun dünyasının hissiyatından çıkarıyor.

Oynanış tarafı ve yapısal sıkıntıları bir kenara bırakıldığında, oynadığınız oyunu önceki serileriyle karşılaştırmadığınız sürece hikaye ve atmosfer açısından istediğinizi bulabileceğiniz bir oyun olacaktır. Türkçe dil desteği bulunmuyor olsa da, internet üzerinde Türkçe yaması mevcut. 7-8 saatlik oynanış süresi ve tekrar oynanabilirliğinin düşük olmasına rağmen yine de fiyatını hak ettiğini düşünüyorum. Ancak indirim dönemlerinde oldukça uygun bir fiyata düştüğünü belirtmekte de fayda var.",

再说说缺点吧，优化太差以至于游戏时常卡顿，以及偶尔会闪退，所以请多存档。还有就是bug非常多，比如在家中自己卧室的床上拿到手电筒后，床对面有一书柜，将三本书往左挪开后会发现一个开关，但在1080p下点开关没反应，此时可以先存档，调低分辨率后再进游戏就行了，或者接手柄操作也可以。打开开关后能进入柜子后的密室，在里面可以拿到一张家里的地图，但是你不拿也没关系，反正没有任何收集成就，家里就这么大想迷路都难，对剧情也没有任何影响。

 游戏共有5个结局，6套服装，每达成一种结局就解锁一套对应的服装，在二周目开始新游戏时可更换服装，但第二套年轻的Alex的装束需要用其他方式取得，方法为进入游戏后在标题界面不要按其他键，按↑↑↓↓←→←→Esc和Enter。具体达成各个结局的方法网上搜一下就知道了，如果想打全结局的话，建议第一次先打出UFO结局，这样二周目回家后就可以在自己卧室里拿到一把无限子弹的激光枪，之后游戏通关就会很轻松。

最后再说一句，这部归乡是寂静岭系列中唯——部上steam的，虽然时隔十几年我才玩到，但依然感觉可以称得上是神作。只可惜这个系列已经很久没有新作了，而科乐美现在沉迷柏青哥无法自拔，所以只要这个IP还捏在科乐美手里，就会一直被雪藏下去，真心希望卡普空这些大厂能把寂静岭的IP买下来重启。",

I think ill do some pros and cons first

Pros:
The game feels like a Silent Hill game (which certain other game didnt achieve) 
Alex is a good character
The graphics are pretty good for 2008
The characters are all well written and are all used well in the plot
The plot itself is a bit of a copycat of 2 but I think it changes stuff up enough.
The Levels are pretty good
The Puzzles can sometimes be pretty good.
The Pacing is really good you always feel like your making progress and the game rarely slows to a crawl or has a dull moment
There's a decent weapon variety 
The Acting is Superb
Writing is excellent

Cons: 
The PC port sucks for a variety of reasons I will cover
It requires a (Unkown Project is what I used) patch or else the game will crash constantly 
Even when patched the game still crashes when loading saves 9/10 times and thats not an exaduration i literally spent at one point 20 mins just loading a save and then the game will crash sometimes it wont but its a huge pain in the ass. 
The facial animations are roboticy when in regular gameplay (in cutscenes their great)
I think this is a just me thing but if I go to 1080p everything 2d (map, text, Steam Notifications) will look fuzzy.
The Loading screens are atrociously long
The Combat is a mixed bag. You can stunlock most enemies with the basic knife and usually its way more useful than the Pipe and Fire Axe. And the nurses who are one of the first enemies you come across are the hardest in the game who use scalpels and like the Knife have no Startup animation meaning they can whup your ass. 
There is no autosave and save points are few and far between

The Plot:
Alex Shepherd an army man has returned home to Shepherds Glen (A neighbouring town of Silent Hill) after he was told his Brother Joshua and Father have gone missing. It soon becomes apparent however that not everything is Normal down in Shephards Glen. Fog appears, there are very little people left in town and the people that still remain are either as confused as you or acting to suspicious and Monsters roam the streets

The Game:
The game is great and at first I thought this was going to be real shit. Ive heard from so many different people this game was garbage and didnt hold a candle to the previous four. While I can say this isnt good as the first three entries. I can definetly say this is my fourth favourite Silent Hill game (though I have only played this and the first four entries). Even though you can see the big twist coming a mile away there is other twists and turns that caught me off guard and the acting and writing really made me almost cry you really get feel Alex's history with Shepherds Glen right from the get go. The game isnt too scary though there are moments like the otherworld and especially the scene in the otherworld Clinic (I wont spoil). 
Anyway my point is you got a real good game here just one thing to keep in mind is if you have an Xbox 360/ONE/Series X/S or PS3 or even have a good enough pc that can emulate PS3 or 360 games then go for it since the PC version is by far the worst way to experience this I have already told you alot about this awful PC port just look at most of the reviews. People are pissed off that they cant even start the damn thing. Plus I didnt get to play this sometimes since the game would often crash when I try to load a save though once I have succesfully loaded a save the game will not crash at all unless I quit and then open the game up again. Still if you have other options use them but if you love silent hill at least give this one a go.

88677218,italian,2021.02.19 03:27,✅,✅,0.6275395155,7,"vanno fatte due recensioni distinte per questo gioco, ""liscio"" (così come viene fornito da Steam) e ""patchato"" con la Unknownproject's patch (non ufficiale, ma che rende il gioco fruibile, ottenibile quì: https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Silent_Hill:_Homecoming)

liscio: provato per pochi minuti ma mi fido delle recensioni tremende, anche nei pochi minuti in cui l'ho provato, mi sono ritrovato con la risoluzione bloccata a 720p giusto per dire il problema forse minore ma visibile fin da subito

unknownproject's patch: decisamente meglio! già ad un primo impatto, come scritto sopra, ho notato un visibile miglioramento dell'mmagine impostandola a 1080p (non garantisco, ma se avete un monitor 4K forse rende ancora meglio), capita saltuariamente che i caricamenti durino almeno un minuto (quando poi in caso di morte e riprovando durano meno, come dovrebbe essere solitamente) e che il gioco vada in crash (apparentemente il grand hotel e la stazione di polizia sono i posti più a rischio per entrambi i problemi sopra riportati, l'hotel stesso da problemi anche ad altri giocatori, con la patch applicata o meno, con un po di pazienza comunque, (non troppa, per fortuna), il titolo è giocabile, divenendo a tutti gli effetti una ""versione potenziata"" di quanto giocabile su Playstation 3 ed Xbox 360, se al contrario siete disposti a sacrificare un po di resa grafica, potreste optare per una di queste ultime due versioni, la prima ha espressioni facciali leggermente peggiori ma migliora il resto della grafica (in questo caso mi baso su esperienze altrui).

nel caso, consiglio di ottenere come primo finale ""UFO"", in modo tale da ottenere la pistola laser che renderà qualsiasi partita successiva ""imbarazzantemente facile"", per compensare il livello di difficoltà più alto selezionabile ad inizio partita e gli eventuali crash e caricamenti lunghi che dovessero capitarvi.

altro consiglio: il gioco ha due scelte importanti, dopo la prima partita con il finale UFO, alla seconda salvate prima di fare la prima scelta dopodiché fate quattro salvataggi distinti, due dopo aver scelto la prima opzione e due dopo aver fatto la seconda, a sua volta progredite in ognuno dei quattro salvataggi fino alla seconda scelta importante e sovrascrivete la prima coppia con le due scelte diverse e fate lo stesso con la seconda, (c'è una terza scelta praticamente alla fine del gioco, influenza solo due finali, ma in tutti gli altri ho comunque voluto scegliere la prima opzione) in questo modo potrete ottenere quattro finali su cinque senza ricominciare il gioco altrettante volte, infine ripartite da zero a livello difficile e ricordatevi la pistola laser dalla stanza del protagonista e di Joshua; (scegliendo di fare una partita in più potrete usarla anche per ottenere tutti i finali al di fuori dello stesso UFO) l'unico collezionabile facile da mancare è una foto ottenibile dalla bacheca dei dispersi, che apparirà come per magia dopo aver sconfitto il secondo boss (dovrete quindi prima tornare in questo posto dove avete incontrato Elle per la prima volta e poi andare a casa vostra, altrimenti non potendo tornare indietro sarà persa per sempre nella partita in corso se salvate).
infine, assicuratevi di mantenere un salvataggio distinto per ogni finale, il fatto che vengano controllati anche quando iniziate una nuova partita mi fa dedurre che il gioco controlli quanti salvataggi con una partita completa ci siano sbloccando i relativi costumi a seconda delle scelte fatte, trovate una guida su come ottenere i vari salvataggi quì, senza spoiler sul contenuto dei finali, ma per ovvi motivi vi anticipa comunque parte della trama:

https://silenthill.fandom.com/wiki/Silent_Hill:_Homecoming_Secrets_and_Unlockables; 

giocando è facile capire quali sono tali decisioni importanti, quindi alla prima partita potete evitare di guardarci (per il finale UFO scegliete la seconda opzione alla prima decisione, date risposte ostili alla seconda ed alla terza decisione la prima opzione), l'unico errore di questo sito è che  in realtà, come già scritto sopra, la terza decisione influenza solo i finali ""no dogs allowed"" (UFO) e ""judgement"" mentre negli altri è ininfluente, il resto è corretto.
ultima considerazione: usando la patch dovrete ""scarificare"" la lingua italiana, ma per quanto mi riguarda il gioco è perfettamente comprensibile lo stesso in inglese, inoltre la configurazione del controller può saltare ad ogni singolo avvio del gioco, consiglio quindi di scaricare reWASD (per poco più di 7 € potete comprare la licenza d'uso una volta scaduta la prova) e mappare i tasti della tastiera e mouse impostati come metodo di input sul controller

It nails the classic silent hill vibe perfectly: Creepy, tension-ramping environments and a huge mind-screw adventure through the foggy gates of a hellish otherworld. Combat with deadly monsters while trying to uncover the dark secrets of a quiet little town. In concept, it's an amazing idea.

In execution, it leaves MUCH to be desired.

The main reason to dislike the game is the combat. It's very clear that a LOT of work went into polishing the combat and making it interesting and dynamic. It was very clearly a labor of love, with excellent combat animations, a dodge and counter system, and even a Coup De Grace system that lets you finish off an enemy quickly if you meet certain conditions.

SO WHY IS IT SO FREAKING BAD!?

Enemies often have wide, sweeping and long-reaching attacks that render your dodging worthless. Readying for a fight by entering your combat stance slows you to a crawl, leaving you MORE vulnerable than if you JUST KEEP RUNNING and try to avoid combat altogether. Certain enemies also have very, very short windows where you can actually harm them, and the game does not IN ANY WAY telegraph ANY of this. You have to learn it through the loading screens after dying. That's right, AFTER you're killed by something and have to sit there waiting a full minute for the game to load in again, you get... a vague tip on how best to off an enemy.

As I said before, enemies often have wide, sweeping, long-reaching attacks that render your dodging worthless. That much is already bad enough in a game that puts so much focus on its combat. But it gets worse, somehow--you also get thrown into tight, cramped spaces where you CAN'T EVEN DODGE AT ALL. Suddenly one of the core mechanics for your survivability are taken away from you and there isn't a thing you can do about it except pray that you have enough ammo in your gun to take out the enemy the easy way.

Presumably, the idea here is that you're supposed to learn how to handle each enemy through trial and error. Which, WOULDN'T be a bad thing, if the game actually gave you the resources to trial! But, you have so little health and so few opportunities to make mistakes that you're inevitably going to die, which is often very punishing and sends you back anywhere from five to ten minutes of gameplay, while leaving you none the wiser on how to approach the enemy. Adding to this problem, there are several enemies that can staggerlock you, leaving you reeling and struggling to escape from the enemy's attack chain and chewing through your health items to have any HOPE of fighting back.

I'm a big fan of the Silent Hill series, so I'm incredibly disappointed to say I will not be finishing this game. What spooky, creepy atmosphere is there is completely ruined by how godawfully punishing and frustrating the combat is. It tries to be Dark Souls in a Silent Hill title, but falls painfully flat.

All of this so far hasn't even gotten into the bugs present in the PC release. So, I'm going to suggest you pass this one up and never look back. If you want to experience it, then watch a Let's Play on youtube or some such.","Silent Hill: Homecoming is a game that I really wish that I could like.

Apro il gioco, risoluzione fissa a 720p, cap a 30 fps: cerco su internet una patch, esiste, la installo.
Riapro il gioco, provo a fare Alt-Tab, il gioco crasha. A quanto pare è un problema comune, trovo una fix, la installo.
Lancio il gioco, come mai in inglese? cerco tra i file, scopro che è possibile cambiare la lingua dai file di configurazione, ma questo fa sparire alcune voci del menu perché la traduzione è assente. Vabbé.
Riapro il gioco... perché si sente tutto da destra? Mi informo: a quanto pare il software è compatibile solo con una scheda audio 5.1. E' necessario installare un driver che aggiri il problema facendo riconoscere le tue cuffie come un sistema surround, ma anche così c'è un problema: tutti i suoni sono traslati a sinistra di una cassa (fonte: ore e ore di ricerche su google per rendere vivibile questa meraviglia). In ogni caso, esiste una patch, la installo, finalmente gioco.

Numero di crash durante il playthrough: 10
Numero di ore ripetute a causa di crash in punti lontani da save points: 3 stimate

Segnale un bug notevole su cui non ho trovato nulla online e che sono riuscito a risolvere per puro caso, potrei essere d'aiuto a qualcuno.
In alcune sezioni del gioco gli npc vi guideranno verso una nuova area, e saranno loro ad aprire le porte. Potrebbe succedere che sbaglino mira ed invece di aprire la porta camminino all'infinito contro il muro accanto.
Signore e signori, la soluzione esiste, e non ci credereste mai: bisogna entrare nelle opzioni e modificare la modalità di input da controller a mouse e tastiera finché non smettono di farvi da Ciceroni.

Superando ese obstucalo, es un buen Silent Hill metido en un mal juego, el lore es bastante interesante llenando cabos sueltos del contexto de Silent Hil así como el desarrollo de algunos personajes , pero las mecánicas de combate están mal llevadas, hasta el punto que tendrás que leer las pantallas de carga para entender (si, están en todas las pantallas de carga esos consejos).

I recently decided to give Silent Hill a go, so I started with SH2, then played through 1, 3, and 4. I got a bit obsessed with the series to say the least - however this title was off-putting due to the negative reviews and ... $40 price? I'll be straight, I got this 90% off for the Halloween sale, so I picked it up. I didn't even attempt to boot this game up vanilla, I installed all recommended mods on PCGW and to my surprise, got it running 3440x1440p at 60FPS. I encountered 2 random crashes in the beginning of the game (which was very annoying, and from that point forward, I was more scared of it crashing again than I was of the game). It stopped crashing after that though, not sure why. 

This port does have a lot of bugs (weird lighting artifacts, scuffed QTE, lack of graphical settings, crash potential) even with applying fixes to it. Like others have pointed out I had to change my sound to 5.1 stereo, which required more work than I thought to dig through Windows 10 settings to find it because without 5.1, most sounds only play through the right side of your speakers/headphones. I am fairly certain enabling Discord overlay crashes the game and I know for a fact that alt+tabbing or hitting your windows key also crashes the game (with the fixes). But mind you, for $4, I wasn't too mad at the hour or two I spent configuring everything to be good to go. So value wise, wait for this to get a deep discount before buying - solely just for the quality of this port.

Quality of the game? As a Silent Hill game? Really different from the classic 4. I was getting tired of the tank controls of the first 4 games, but this one right off the bat had a great movement feeling with a controller. Controlling Alex really did feel great, I liked moving around with him, it made traversal and combat more satisfying and less frustrating. Combat does feel good in my opinion (although parrying is incredibly difficult, dodging and rolling doesn't have i-frames, and also requires intense precision). With those additional elements, I can see why people dislike this combat because it is more complex than just bashing or spamming fire. You have to aim with your guns, you can do combos with melee, enemies can easily one shot you (because there are no button prompts for various situations...). It's much faster; and on that topic, enemies, while not greatly varied, are really cool. I liked their designs, reminded me of the other games. Bosses? Awesome - a blast to play the bosses. Music? Great as expected. Atmosphere? Oh man - particularly, when in the Other World, the sets are awesome. Gross, mechanical, orange, rusty - a pleasure to traverse and look at, especially with the nice filter they have on it. That's when this game feels like a Silent Hill game, when you are in the Other World. The transition in real time is nice to watch as well. When you are in the normal world, this game doesn't really feel like a Silent Hill, almost more like Resident Evil than anything - just an action/kinda spooky game. I didn't really care or mind, just as long as I enjoyed myself. For the most part I did. The story invested me enough to want to finish the game - but definitely had some weird/annoying parts in the second half of the game. I suppose I'd recommend, but do know, it's a gamble, because it could totally not work.

Like others have pointed out I had to change my sound to 5.1 stereo, which required more work than I thought to dig through Windows 10 settings to find it because without 5.1, most sounds only play through the right side of your speakers/headphones. I am fairly certain enabling Discord overlay crashes the game and I know for a fact that alt+tabbing or hitting your windows key also crashes the game (with the fixes). But mind you, for $4, I wasn't too mad at the hour or two I spent configuring everything to be good to go. So value wise, wait for this to get a deep discount before buying - solely just for the quality of this port.

Quality of the game? As a Silent Hill game? Really different from the classic 4. I was getting tired of the tank controls of the first 4 games, but this one right off the bat had a great movement feeling with a controller. Controlling Alex really did feel great, I liked moving around with him, it made traversal and combat more satisfying and less frustrating. Combat does feel good in my opinion (although parrying is incredibly difficult, dodging and rolling doesn't have i-frames, and also requires intense precision). With those additional elements, I can see why people dislike this combat because it is more complex than just bashing or spamming fire. You have to aim with your guns, you can do combos with melee, enemies can easily one shot you (because there are no button prompts for various situations...). It's much faster; and on that topic, enemies, while not greatly varied, are really cool. I liked their designs, reminded me of the other games. Bosses? Awesome - a blast to play the bosses. Music? Great as expected. Atmosphere? Oh man - particularly, when in the Other World, the sets are awesome. Gross, mechanical, orange, rusty - a pleasure to traverse and look at, especially with the nice filter they have on it. That's when this game feels like a Silent Hill game, when you are in the Other World. The transition in real time is nice to watch as well. When you are in the normal world, this game doesn't really feel like a Silent Hill, almost more like Resident Evil than anything - just an action/kinda spooky game. I didn't really care or mind, just as long as I enjoyed myself. For the most part I did. The story invested me enough to want to finish the game - but definitely had some weird/annoying parts in the second half of the game. I suppose I'd recommend, but do know, it's a gamble, because it could totally not work.

79038856,french,2020.10.10 13:07,❌,✅,0.5,1,"Je n'ai jamais fais de Silent Hill de ma vie. Oui, c'est honteux. Et pourtant je me considere tout de même comme joueur ayant acquis ses classiques. Alors pourquoi commencer directement par Homecoming qui est selon les joueurs : un crachat au visage de la saga ? Steam + solde = j'ai craqué. Et je me voyais pas vraiment refaire les anciens premiers sur émulation par peur d'avoir un jeu trop vieillot entre les mains. Mais je peux vous l'affirmer tout de suite avant même que j'eu commencé le jeu : c'est une horreur d'optimisation.

Déjà, le jeu se lance pas. Problème de mon pc ou d'installation ? Aucun des deux, il se lance une fois sur deux et en qualité immonde en 800x600. Il faudra trouver un patch fait par la communauté pour le mettre en 1080p et un deuxième que je vous conseille pour pouvoir mettre le jeu en fenêtré si vous êtes habitué aux alt + tab pour répondre à vos potes sur discord. Ça a failli me dégouter du jeu et j'ai failli demander le remboursement, mais première épreuve réussite.

Deuxièmement, chez moi le jeu n'est pas en stéréo et c'est même la première fois que je remarque un soucis pareil avec un casque sur les oreilles. Le son est mal fait. Parfois on entend le personnages parler que dans l'oreille droite et les bruitages des monstres qui sont derrières nous envahissent l'oreille gauche. Je sais pas ce qu'ils ont foutu, mais la spacialisation du son est une catastrophe. Bordel, on entend les ennemis à gauche, mais ils sont devant, on entend quelqu’un parler mais la voix résonne que du côté droit et en tout bas, mais comment on peut sortir un jeu comme ça ? J’aurais pu chercher un patch, mais il en faut combien pour jouer à un jeu correct ? Pourquoi ils ont pas corrigés tous ces soucis à la con ? Mais ce n’est pas tout.

Pendant tout le jeu, j’ai eu le jeu qui « ne répond pas » à chaque début de chargement. En fait, c’est ce qui fait le plus flipper dans ce jeu : les chargements. Vous avancez dans une zone, chargement qui bug le jeu ne répond pas, vous trouvez une sauvegarde, chargement qui bug le jeu ne répond pas, vous entrez dans une maison, le jeu ne répond pas, vous avez une cinématique, chargement qui bug le jeu ne répond pas....... un enfer, j’ai jamais vu ça.

C’est con, parce qu’à part ces soucis j’ai plutôt aimé le jeu même si c’est censé être le plus mauvais Silent Hill. J’ai été pris dans cette spirale des enfers et cette ambiance lugubre d’une ville fantôme, des créatures horribles difformes (et sans aucun sens par la même occasion), de l’angoisse des environnements et tout le tralala qui marche bien pour ce genre de jeu flippant. En fait, je pense que je l’aurais beaucoup mieux apprécié s’il était bien optimisé sur steam et ça m’aurait encore plus envie de connaître les autres jeux mythique de la franchise.

Je retiens tout de même une histoire qui paraît sans logique, mais qui tient tout de même la route si on s’y intéresse et quelques moments légèrement stressant parce qu’on va pas se mentir, il suffit de courir tranquillement pour éviter 80% des ennemis, sauf combats obligatoires. D’ailleurs le gameplay contre les méchants est plutôt dynamique et simple à prendre en main. On peut esquiver, taper avec un combo... mais la dague de fin de jeu est très vite craquée. J’ai fini la plupart des boss avec celle ci. Puis eux, les boss, sont vachement cool : flippant et chelou qui collent parfaitement à ce que j’attendais d’un Silent Hill. Outre ces mobs difformes tout degeulasse qu’on rencontre en jeu (en plus que le bestiaire est relativement pauvre), les quelques boss ont plutôt une bonne tête et ont un design que j’ai trouvé très réussi !

En vrai j’ai quand même passé des bons moments dessus malgré que le jeu a crash lors de la cinématique finale (et que je l’ai desinstallé derrière et maté la scène de fin sur youtube ha - ha ntm). Pour le prix pendant les soldes d’halloween, j’ai satisfait ma curiosité. A part que j’ai trouvé le jeu vraiment facile et tous ces soucis d’optimisations, j’ai bien aimé, mais je ne le conseille pas du tout. Pas sûr steam en tout cas, ou faites attention aux modalités de remboursement sur steam pour pas vous faire enfler de quelques euros.",

It's possible to play without the maps, I've done it on other games (And I believe some players pride themselves on doing so), but it makes an already blue-key blue-door game mechanic far more tedious than it's worth if you're in it for the story rather than boasting rite.

Now, as to the game content itself outside of whether you own it on PC or Console.

This entry into the Silent Hill Franchise is, in my opinion, a sturdy, but not true Silent Hill in contrast to the ones beforehand. It's a little more action-paced than the standard Survival Horror that the previous five have been, which is a good thing if you're not so big on true survival horror but want to dip your toes into the Silent Hill Universe to see if you want to plunge your wallet into the void.

-- A lot of people complain about the facial animation of characters in the game, and that's fine, but I personally haven't seen it all that detrimental. It's a 12 year old game, so it won't be state of the art graphics or quality. 

-- Story-wise there isn't that much in connection to the previous five games, and this game itself is more of an ""it's own story"" kind of entry. You won't learn much, if anything about the events of the previous games, and this game doesn't even take place in the mentioned town itself.

What should I say about this game that wasn´t already said?

The story is great. But at the same time, it feels like it´s an unnecessary addon on a story that was already both vague and complicated at the same time. It´s not as much a Silent Hill game as it´s a spinoff. The exploration is minimal, and even through maps are big, they are extremely linear. The combat system is absolute trash, and the puzzles are easy to solve.

Also, we have to talk about Konami and how they fucked this game up, and not only this game, but also SAW. They messed SAW up so to the point where it got unlisted from Steam due to the end of license, but it had trash combat and interaction system, otherwise it´s a fine game. But why is this game still up on the store if it is a trash port that never got fixed?

There is a ton of issues in here, only present in the PC port. Widescreen is messed up, audio channels are all over the place, Alt+Tab crashes the game, sometimes the game crashes at random spots during gameplay, (and this is probably the first issue you´re going to encounter) the game crashes after starting. It´s an absolute nightmare to fix it, and it took me about 4 hours to find all the fixes outside of the game (with about 3 reinstalls & several game file integrity checks). And it added 2 hours of game time to my counter while I was trying to fix it, restarting the game so many times I´ve lost the count. 

Overall, I can´t recommend this game, unless you are a masochist and like going through grueling pain while trying to make your games work.","SPOILER FREE

What should I say about this game that wasn´t already said?

The story is great. But at the same time, it feels like it´s an unnecessary addon on a story that was already both vague and complicated at the same time. It´s not as much a Silent Hill game as it´s a spinoff. The exploration is minimal, and even through maps are big, they are extremely linear. The combat system is absolute trash, and the puzzles are easy to solve.

Also, we have to talk about Konami and how they fucked this game up, and not only this game, but also SAW.

El juego: El juego es bastante aceptable, sigue teniendo la clásica esencia de los Silent Hill pero ahora mas orientado a la acción, lo cual es totalmente justificable, ya que el personaje, a diferencia de los protagonistas anteriores, esta vez cuenta con experiencia en combate cuerpo a cuerpo y con armas,  lo que otorga una nueva experiencia a la hora de matar monstruos. Ahora el personaje cuenta con postura de combate, lo que solo permite enfocarse en un enemigo a la vez, sin embargo, hay que tener cuidado que aún pueden atacarnos por la espalda. En la postura de combate el personaje puede atacar, esquivar, contraatacar y rodar para esquivar los ataques de largo alcance de los enemigos; los cuales por cierto, se redujeron notablemente a comparación de juegos anteriores, tanto en cantidad como en variedad, sacrificandolos por una mayor profundidad de combate a la hora de enfrentarse con ellos, ya que cada uno tiene diferentes patrones de ataque y estrategias para enfrentarse a ellos. Se recorre una variedad interesante de escenarios, sin embargo no se pasa tanto tiempo dentro de estas locaciones, ya que son bastantes lineales y sin puzzles como solía hacerse, basicamente los objetivos son: llegar a x punto, conseguir la llave / objeto y regresar a una puerta que ahora podras abrir. Lo mejor es ver el cambio que sufre el escenario cuando entras a la dimensión infernal, y la historia, la cual se podría considerar como una secuela spin-off de la trama original sobre el pueblo contada en el primer Silent Hill.

Esta versión del juego: Lo mas trágico aquí es el pobre port que nos otorgaron, lleno de problemas y fallas, y no son pequeñas como glitchs o texturas, hablamos de que el juego inesperadamente te va fallar y se va cerrar sin dar ni previo aviso, durante mi partida constantemente guardaba los datos para evitar tener que repetir un gran tramo de juego cuando sucediera, y ocurre en cualquier momento, ya sea abriendo tu mapa, caminando, y mas comúnmente en las pantallas de carga, 3 veces tuve que vencer al enemigo final porque el juego se trababa en la pantalla de carga, y si, tuve que ver las cinematicas todas la veces, ya que hay videos que pueden saltarse y otros que no. Me gusto el juego, pero estos bugs te desmotivan de que desees rejugarlo para obtener los demás finales, si vas a estar con problemas de estabilidad cada partida vas a terminar prefiriendo jugar una sola vez por tu cuenta, y buscar el resto de finales/secretos en internet al igual que yo.

Porque lo recomiendo? Porque el juego en si es bueno, como ya comente, lo disfrute, y es bastante decente en gameplay e historia. Pero los problemas técnicos del port hacen que muchos jugadores lo abandonen o lo pasen por alto, y no los culpo. Recomiendo jugarlo, pero de ser posible consiganse las versiones que salieron para alguna consola, en pc solo lo jugaría como ultimo recurso, y solamente si lo compran con descuento.",

Como um jogo de aventura (sim, difícil enquadrá-lo como survival horror), ele é divertido, com bons puzzles e algumas batalhas interessantes. Tem uma dublagem boa e a trilha sonora é adequada. O enredo é fraco em comparação as demais Silent Hill (impossível não comparar todo o tempo!). Fala um pouco da cidade (passa-se em uma localidade próxima - Shepherd's Glen, uma cidade do outro lado do lago Toluca, que banha Silent Hill) original, cita um outro personagem dos jogos anteriores...mas as relações terminam por aí. Portanto, é um Silent Hill ""não-silent-hill"". Talvez se valesse como um spin off...

[i]Silent Hill Homecoming[/i] is a third-person ""survival horror"" game and the fifth in the series. You control Alex Shepherd, and you come back to your hometown of Shepherd's Glen to visit your family and friends. You find out that its residents, including your younger brother, disappeared during your absence. Your goal is to find out what happened and investigate the truth of this forsaken town. I am a massive [i]Silent Hill[/i] fan, and I consider the first four my all-time favorites, and I can honestly say, without a shadow of a doubt, that this is the worst one in the entire franchise.
 
[h3]Pros[/h3]
✔️ Bosses are great and memorable.
✔️ For a 12-year-old game, the graphics still look decent.
✔️ Topnotch soundtrack. 
 
[h3]Cons[/h3]
❌ Mediocre story, with uninteresting characters and subpar writing.
❌ Poor combat system.
❌ Reused enemies from previous [i]Silent Hill[/i] games.
❌ Less horror, more action-oriented.
❌ Mixed bag puzzles.
❌ Bad facial animation.
❌ Unoptimized port, constant FPS issues.
 
[h1]Story[/h1]
You play as Alex Shephard, a soldier returning from war to visit his family in your hometown, Shepherd's Glen. You also meet some of its residents, such as Elle and Curtis, only to find out that people have gone missing over the years, including your little brother, Josh, since you left for the military. You start to search the town, trying to find him, which leads you to a town called [i]Silent Hill[/i]. It is up to you to find out where your brother is, discover the truth about Shepherd's Glen and how it ties with the town of [i]Silent Hill[/i]
 
The game starts with you having a nightmare about your little brother in a rusted-metal world before waking up in the cab of a truck (coincidently driven by the main protagonist of [i]Silent Hill Origins[/i], Travis Grady). I liked the intro sequence; it was intense and almost captured the previous games' horror atmosphere.
 
However, all the characters, including Alex, are boring, uninteresting, and sometimes idiotic. The only names that I remembered after completing the story were Josh and Alex; the others were just that forgettable. The game mainly drew inspiration from the first[i]Silent Hill[/i] [b]movie[/b], and barely from the previous four games. Overall, the story itself is mediocre and forgettable, with lots of weird and dumb moments that make you scratch your head out of confusion, with a lousy cliche twist at the end.
 
[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Exploration and survival horror clearly weren't the main focus here; it felt more of an action-focused game with very few scary moments (such as the intro sequence and some of the bosses). In my opinion, It didn't feel like a [i] Silent Hill[/i] game; it just wasn't scary, since it relies on cheap jumpscares rather than the atmosphere, and completely missing the psychological horror aspect of previous titles.
 
[u]Combat[/u]
The combat systems in previous games are somewhat outdated, yet they serve their purpose; they create that sense of dread and tension every time you face an enemy, making you decide whether or not to confront it or run away to save ammo. [i]Silent Hill Homecoming[/i], however, probably has the worst combat system in the franchise; you can easily stunlock the enemy with multiple attacks, and vice versa, making those enemy encounters frustrating and infuriating rather than scary and intense.
 
There's a good variety of weapons that you can use, such as a pipe, axe, handgun, rifle (with limited ammo for some reason, and the aiming is somewhat clunky), and so on. Also, instead of using fixed camera angles that the series is known for, the game utilizes a third-person view. The flashlight and radio are back, as you will visit some very dark areas, and the radio alerts you of nearby enemies by emitting static noise.

[u]Enemies and bosses[/u]
The monsters in [i]Silent Hill[/i] games are always unique; everyone usually represents an inner fear, insecurities, sexual urges, or something dark lurking in someone's psyche. It's been theorized that every person who visits the town sees the monsters differently. There's a good variety of monsters in this game, but the new ones look mediocre and unimaginative. 
 
They even managed to bring some iconic monsters from [i]Silent Hill 2 & 3[/i], and the most infamous one being Pyramid Head (the game likes to call him Bogeyman). The Bogeyman only appears in 2 scenes (and one bad ending), which you can cut out of the game, and it won't affect the story at all; he is entirely pointless. However, there are a total of 4 main boss battles in the game, and they are pretty good and memorable, especially with the help of Akira Yamaoka's great music.
 
You can't run in this game, and you'll be spending a lot of time walking from point A to point B. They added QTEs for some reason, and they feel out of place. Luckily, you can install a mod that can disable that feature (go to the [b]Technical[/b] section for more info). Puzzles were a mixed bag; some were fine, but the rest were just lazy and too easy. 
 
[h1]Graphics[/h1]
For a 12-year-old game, the graphics still look decent, with good fog and great lighting. However, it has its problems, such as blurry textures, bad facial animations and sometimes poor lip-sync. The transition from the regular world to the nightmarish one looks great and very similar to the movie.

[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]
The series veteran, Akira Yamaoka, composed the soundtrack. It's what you expect from a [i]Silent Hill[/i] game; amazing, yet terrifying music that creates an unsettling atmosphere, filled with horror and despair. I especially love the boss battle themes. Akiro does not use strings in his music, like every other horror game/movie. Instead, he uses electronic instruments and sometimes noisey grindings to build up the intensity to make the player feel uncomfortable.

Every single Silent Hill PC port is bad, but this one is the absolute worst of the lot. The sound is only designed for 5.1 surround systems and cannot be changed without a fan made patch, (which may or may not work, depending on who knows). On a regular stereo (2.0 or 2.1 system), most sound effects only play through the right speaker. The game's sound effects and music regularly cut out during game play. Enemies get stuck in attack animation loops that you can not get out of, causing many cheap deaths. You cannot run this game in any resolution beyond 720p without another fan made patch. The game crashes if you try to alt+tab to your desktop (fixed by downloading 3rd party software and injecting it into the game's EXE). There are regular freezes during loading between scenes and levels that last up to 5 minutes. There is a game breaking bug during one of the very final acts that is impassable because the QTE system is broken (again fixed by a fan patch but doesn't always work - I ended up quitting in frustration and uninstalling before reaching the ending). If you die during a boss battle, you will restart the checkpoint but cannot skip the proceeding cut scene. Input is severely delayed at times making traversal and combat clunky and frustrating. Many times, clicking to shoot your weapon simply will not work. Many times, facial textures don't load in.

Want to experience Silent Hill: Homecoming? Buy it on 360 or PS3, where it actually works properly.

Or better yet, avoid it altogether and just listen to the incredible soundtrack online. It's the best part of the entire experience.

Mais c'est le seul SILENT HILL sur Steam et, en fan de la 1ère heure, j'ai quand même voulu essayer.
Attention - j'aime beaucoup ce jeu. Mais je ne recommande pas la version PC fournie par l'éditeur sur Steam, qui, tous les deux, cautionnent la présence d'un truc mal configuré.
Mon pouce rouge sanctionne le portage que j'ai acheté, que vous allez peut-être acheter, car il est inadmissible.
Par contre, ""Homecoming"", lui, s'avère très prenant, et il possède tout de même l'âme de SH, notamment avec cette intention de rendre hommage directement au premier par le retour du brouillard.
Alex est aussi un Harry, quelque part.
Pour suivre les instructions afin d'y jouer proprement, scrollez directement en bas de l'éval'.


Cet opus, réalisé par un studio en sous-traitance via KONAMI, ne bénéfie pas du talent de la fameuse Silent team. Seul reste à bord Akira Yamaoka, qui signe une musique à la hauteur -comme toujours.
Le single est juste superbe, comme à chaque opus et toute la partition est digne de la série.

Si l'ensemble fait très vieillot, son charme prend cependant, via une direction artistique correcte, un doublage agréable et la musique de mister Yamaoka. L'ambiance du jeu, bien qu'orientée vers les combats, n'est pas le point faible. D'ailleurs la caméra à l'épaule façon Resident Evil n'est pas désagréable, et le gameplay se montre plutôt nerveux (avec esquives, contre-attaque et combo !).
Quant au côté ""fan-made"" et fauché, il a son petit effet vintage / old school / Playstation plutôt sympa, au final..! (en attendant un remake ?)
Le scénario est assez scolaire, les auteurs & développeurs ayant scrupuleusement aligné, sans grand génie, les éléments de Silent Hill. C'est efficace cela dit.
Et ça reste très valable.
En même temps, qu'aurions-nous pu faire de plus, après tant de jeux passés (c'est le 6e) ?

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2244252441

Non, ce qui fâche, c'est la partie purement technique : en l'état, vanilla, ""Homecoming"" présente une interface buggée où les touches requises n'apparaissent pas, des problèmes de sons, ou de saccades visuelles, des temps de chargement fous, et surtout, entre 2 sauvegardes disséminées ça et là, on peut subir un crash à chaque loading. L'angoisse vient donc d'avantage du retour-bureau aléatoire que de l'atmosphère proprement dite.



MAIS!

... Un travail étonnant a été fourni par UnknownProject, un russe un peu allumé qui a concocté un patch complet.

 Mais malgré ça et autres fixes faits par des joueurs dévoués, rien n'y fait, ça plante, de temps en temps.

A mentési rendszer valami botrány, hülye fix pontok...... és ez leginkább azért baj, mert a játék versenyt csinál abból, hogy mikor tud összeomlani újra. Nekem rendszerint 2-3. indításra indult el eleve. Az elejét 4X toltam végig a crash-ek miatt. A beszédhangok néha kb egyáltalán nem hallgatók mert olyan erősek az egyéb hangok. Medkit és lőszerfukarság van, ami nem lenne gáz, de divatot csinál abból is a game, hogy a nyakadba vág egyszerre több masszívabb ellenfelet. Nekem konkrétan az első Boss-t egy baltával kellett elverni mert addigra semmim nem maradt, máshogy odáig se jutok el.... A mozgás baromi darabos, látszik hogy konzolból lett átemelve, de nem igazán sikerült optimalizálni. A puzzle-öknél néha nem veszi be a kurzort.... hányás.... Arról nem beszélve, hogy egyes ellenfelek erőszintje is ugrál. A nővérkéket az elején pikkpakk szétkaptam, később meg jobban tartottam tőlük, mint akármelyik boss-tól....

Silent Hill Homecoming est un jeu qui est pensé Survival horror comme pour les Resident Evil, en tout cas plus que tout les autres SH, son histoire n'est pas la meilleur, le gameplay est rigide au plus haut point et l'ai toujours sur Ps3.

Le défaut principal du jeu sur Steam c'est qu'il n'est pas fait pour les joueur PC (clavier souris, bon courage à vous car je sais je l'ai testé), car le temps d'avoir le réflexe pour switch le mode course avec le mode attaque, vous vous êtes pris des dégats des créatures et boss...

Judging this as a standalone title does it absolutely no justice. The monsters are extremely irritating to deal with, which ruins any scare factor. Most, ramp up in difficulty and cause me to want to just turn the game off after getting my health bar drained by the tacky movie nurses. Or refuse to piss off so running from them doesn't work. They're either way too hard or way too easy.
 The combat and control delay causes you to smash a bunch of buttons with little to no response and is infuriating. The over the shoulder mouse controlled camera seems to swing wildy no matter what mouse sensitivity I have it set to and gets WAY too close to the back of the characters head, taking up the whole POV.

The puzzles all the way through are completely infantile till the last two that seem to throw you into MYST, usually the item to solve it is just around the corner and requires no thought, just a trek through the hordes of Scissor feet monsters and a lot of doors. 


I am NOT someone who cares about graphics if the artistry of the game is good. However both are pretty yucky. The animation on all the characters (especially when they talk) is just BAD. Comparing it to Silent Hill 2 or 3 which came out on the PS2 in 2001-2003, its really ridiculous. They're extremely stiff and emotionless.
The entire color pallet of this game is, no joke, orange or gray. the items in every room repeat themselves and there is little to no visual interest anywhere. (besides the boss rooms)

The only things I can say that aren't negative is that the story isn't the worst. It has SOME value.
The bosses are pretty interesting compared to the weird flesh blobs running around usually. Each boss seems to fit a theme and its design corresponds to the story behind their creation, visually at least.
The music is decent, being composed by the series musician Akira Yamaoka.

That's it. its not fun to play. Honestly. I would watch a Youtuber play it if you really want to see it.

","I tried to go easy on this game, but after 5 times attempting to play it on PC AND Ps3, I really don't like it. There's a lot I can say about it so I guess this is where I say it.

Judging this as a standalone title does it absolutely no justice. The monsters are extremely irritating to deal with, which ruins any scare factor. Most, ramp up in difficulty and cause me to want to just turn the game off after getting my health bar drained by the tacky movie nurses. Or refuse to piss off so running from them doesn't work. They're either way too hard or way too easy.
 The combat and control delay causes you to smash a bunch of buttons with little to no response and is infuriating. The over the shoulder mouse controlled camera seems to swing wildy no matter what mouse sensitivity I have it set to and gets WAY too close to the back of the characters head, taking up the whole POV.

The puzzles all the way through are completely infantile till the last two that seem to throw you into MYST, usually the item to solve it is just around the corner and requires no thought, just a trek through the hordes of Scissor feet monsters and a lot of doors. 


I am NOT someone who cares about graphics if the artistry of the game is good. However both are pretty yucky. The animation on all the characters (especially when they talk) is just BAD. Comparing it to Silent Hill 2 or 3 which came out on the PS2 in 2001-2003, its really ridiculous. They're extremely stiff and emotionless.

Ignorando o fato de que já é um jogo datado e portanto os gráficos são de mais de uma década atrás, o que mais incomoda nesse jogo é a quantidade absurda de defeitos. O jogo é instável, fecha do nada, tem travamentos constantes de até 15 ou 20 segundos, bugs bizarros com o inventário, loadings frequentes e demorados. O jogo é uma constante demonstração de como não fazer um port. Fora isso, assim como o Silent Hill Origins do PS2, é um jogo desinteressante, que de longe lembra os Silent Hills bons, mas no fundo é uma casca vazia que se aproveita do nome da franquia pra ganhar mais uns trocados. Jogar o jogo na dificuldade mais alta é outra demonstração de como não fazer. Limites ridículos de munição. Não basta as balas serem escassas e quase inúteis contra os inimigos, tem que limitar o jogador a carregar no máximo 15 ridículas balas de pistola. Passe longe. A Konami perdeu o rumo faz tempo. Tanto tempo que esse jogo já foi feito por terceiros, só foi publicado por ela.

Największym problemem zdawały się błędy techniczne, często zdarzało się grze zaciąć, bardzo długo ładować albo nawet w ogóle się nie załadować... może wynikało to z mojego starego sprzętu a może gra jest źle zoptymalizowana na PC. Wtedy to byłby duży minus.

In my understanding, Silent Hill not just refers to a ghost town and also refers to a supernatural phenomenon that summoned by humans[spoiler]cult[/spoiler]. Place where Silent Hill happens is covered with heavy fog and inhabitants there gradually disappear. There is an outer world and an inner world where Silent Hill happens. The outer world is the same as the normal world, with monsters crawling around. The inner world, besides the lurking monsters, the world mutates into a mixture of red blood, scarlet flesh and rusty iron. 

It is a very cool concept. It set a wonderful tone for a mysterious theme horror game. However, Silent Hill Homecoming does not execute the idea well. While it did create a horrifying atmosphere with scene-setting, lights and spooky sounds, the story is very plain and the gameplay is boring, failing to be an immersive game. You basically just walk from points to points, kill some monsters and experience some stuff that you don’t feel anything. There is no surprise twist, indulging plot or truly horrifying scene to match the creepy atmosphere. It is not even a good storyteller, with lots of inconsistent cutscenes and unnecessary and ambiguous choices to make. Besides, although it is a good idea to use melee attack as a conventional attack to replace gun shooting commonly seen is a good idea (but you do have three guns with very limited ammo), the combat is poorly designed. It adopts a very strange camera angle for melee attack that different from the one in walking and an even stranger gun shooting angle that provides a very limited field of view. Control in combat is very unhandy as well. You have to press shift which I often forgot to do, to enter the fighting mode that has a very limit dodge range compared to normal walking mode, causing even more difficulty in combat. Overall, combat is hard, not fun and even frustrating and the game is very hard to keep playing.

Even worse, this game is extremely poorly transplanted from console to PC. I watched videos on YouTube showing this game run far better on console than PC. In PC version, the control is bad, requiring longer response time for the character to react; some scenes are so dark that I basically could not see anything even in maximum brightness; optimization really sucks as frame rate is super unstable and averagely low; glitches happen pretty often in the form of game crashing for multiple times (and my game was not saved); and generally poor transplant (the game does not show left/right mouse button icons). It makes this game a disastrous playing experience. 

To fix most of the issues (except brightness and optimization), I recommend checking the following link. But using this patch will lead to the disappearance of dodge warning signs during combat, slightly upgrading the combat difficulty.

- Otimização real para PC.
- Localização para português brasileiro.
- Melhores controles de Câmera.
- Modo de câmera fixa em determinados pontos do cenário.
- Profundidade na história.
- Conexões reais com os fatos de entradas anteriores da série (e não somente nomes nos arquivos e menções rápidas).

Eu tinha expectativas baixas, mas confesso que me surpreendi positivamente com ele... claro, não supera os primeiros, mas achei bem melhor que o 4, por exemplo. Alex é um personagem bacana, o voice acting de todos é muito bom, tem o barulhinho do rádio, fog, enfermeiras deformadas gostosas, versões macabras dos cenários, referências aos outros jogos... enfim, vários elementos clássicos da série estão ali, ainda que meio mal encaixados, afinal não é uma produção do Team Silent.

PORÉM

O port do jogo pra PC é tão ruim, que a experiência é um terror a parte. Seguramente uns 20% do tempo total de jogo vai ser com carregamentos, já que os loadings são bem demorados. Procure salvar sempre que possível, pq muitos bugs e crashes farão vc se obrigar a fechar e abrir o jogo novamente, isso quando ele não fecha sozinho. Aliás, isso até inclui um elemento extra de tensão e suspente, pq nunca dá pra saber se o jogo vai ""crashar"" depois um loading.

É uma pena realmente, eu estava curtindo bastante, mas depois que perdi umas 2h de progresso por causa de um dos muitos crashes (eu estava longe no jogo até), me sobrou apenas o lamento e botão de desinstalar :(",

Bohužel optimalizace na w10 je pěst na oko a flusnul bych nejradši Konami do držky za to jak moc srali na Silent Hill. Bez fixu, kterej je, ale lehce k dostání neskutečně padá. Po fixu mi spadla jen párkrát. Sice to nasere jelikož hra nemá autosave po cutscéně ani po boss fightu, tak se občas opotite až na vám pot z koulí půjde rovnou přes hráz do analniho otvoru, najde si cestu vašim vnitřkem a objeví se na čele. Ale dá se to přežít. Hra těžké není jen se stačí naučit pohyby enemaku a jejich slabiny. 
Občas backtracking a hledání píčovin a občas nesmyslnej puzzle, ale já s ničím dlouho neseru a pokud už jsem měl chuť rozmlátit hlavu o zeď, tak jsem si našel návod. Nehraju to přece kurva kvůli puzzle, ale kvůli příběhu. Většina enemaku se dá jen oběhnout a už vás srat nebudou. Příběhově docela fajn, ale zdá se jak, kdyby ještě aspoň půlka chyběla, abych dostal ten pravdu feel Silent Hillu. Jo a jeste to využiju, proto abych poslal Konami do útrob jejich vlastní prdele :)",

Hra nabízí hezké strašidelné prostředí, skvělé ozvučení a soundtrack. Líbil se mi design save pointů, kdy je musíte hledat všude okolo, protože kolikrát nejsou úplně na očích. Také si hráč kvůli tomu musí plánovat další postup. Naopak se mi ale vůbec nelíbily automatické save pointy před boss fighty, protože když umřete (a to se stává často), musíte si znovu prohlédnout několikaminutové nepřeskočitelné cutscény. Hlavní problém této hry je, že je to hodně špatně provedený port z konzole. Nízké FPS učiní hru v některých částech sotva hratelnou, bojový systém je s klávesnicí a myší pomalý a velmi nepřesný. Hra má jinak mnoho bugů a já osobně jsem jich i hodně zažil, často zaplatíte smrtí v souboji, který jinak není možné skoro prohrát. Nebo hra jednoduše crashne a vy ztratíte veškerý postup od posledního uložení. Ačkoliv se mi příběh nakonec velmi líbil a boss fighty a hádanky kolikrát představovaly solidní výzvu, celkový dojem ze hry jako takové je zkažen právě technickou stránkou počítačové verze.",

Historia jest mocno skomplikowana i podawana w małych kawałkach (co również jest wadą logiczną, ale o tym później), ale dzięki temu brniesz dalej. Ortodoksyjni fani będą narzekać na mało treści pozostawionych do własnej interpretacji, przeciętny gracz będzie z tego raczej zadowolony. Gameplay w stosunku do części 1-4 został mocno odświeżony i przystosowany do dzisiejszych realiów (nawet po 13 latach od premiery nie zauważyłem większych archaizmów), przez co nawet pod tym względem nikt nie powinien się odbić. Ale gra jest przecież hejtowana. Dlaczego?

Przede wszystkim port PC. Z poziomu aplikacji nie masz żadnych opcji graficznych, klatki są na sztywno ustawione na limit 30 (nie zmieniaj tej wartości w plikach jeśli chcesz przeżyć QTE z bossami). Same klatki sporadycznie potrafią spaść do poniżej 20 (Ryzen 5 3600, 16 GB RAM, Radeon 5600XT. WTF?!). Pal to licho, da się zacisnąć zęby i przeżyć. To nie Crysis, ta gra dziś nie będzie wyglądać. Gra się crashuje. Rób często save, nigdy nie wiesz, kiedy kolejny raz zobaczysz pulpit. Jest wiele sztuczek ""zmniejszających częstotliwość występowania crashy"", ale nie pozbywają się ich w 100%. A, co jakiś czas gra robi ""checkpointy"" na wypadek śmierci i na moment gra się freezuje.
Ok, za co jeszcze by grę zbesztać? Za balans trudności? Ok. Psychiatryk jest banalny. Cmentarz też. Hotel - &^$@&*%$, czemu te potwory dostały takiego boosta? Komisariat? Jeszcze trudniej! Kanały? Nuda. Więzienie - nuda. Finałowy boss? Może zawiążecie mi oczy, żeby miał jakieś szanse?
Druga sprawa to przeciwnicy - potrafią zapędzić Cię w róg i wyprowadzać takie combo, że będziesz pić toniki jak alkoholik denaturat. Albo nie dadzą rady wyprowadzić żadnego celnego ciosu.
System walki? Później będziesz jej unikać, ale na początku będzie trudno. Na szczęście 95% starć to 1 vs 1 (jak jest więcej to nadmiarowi wrogowie >zwykle< czekają na swoją kolej) i da się wyjść z sensownym zdrowiem, ale walka z bossami irytuje. Sepulcher i Asphyxia wymagają celowania w konkretne części ciała i 
automatyczne namierzanie ""głównego punktu"" mocno to utrudnia.

A co z fabułą? Miejscami nie ma sensu. Pyramid-head i Travis Grady są tu wrzuceni na siłę, a sam fakt, że nikt nie mówi Alexowi, co się stało i to wszystko nie ma sensu uniknęłoby wielu ofiar (chyba że za kanoniczne uznamy zakończenie Hospital albo Drowning). Poza tym historia jest bardzo dobra, osobiście stawiam ją wyżej niż Origins czy Downpoor.

Podsumowując: jeśli masz stary komputer, który nie będzie crashować gry albo duże pokłady cierpliwości gra sprawi całkiem sporo frajdy. Do poziomu SH 1-4 co prawda jej brakuje, jednak w moim przekonaniu nie dużo. Ze wszystkich gier nie stworzonych przez Team Silent dla mnie jest to najlepsza pozycja.",

Sound is broken, graphics are borderline mid-90s low-res and blurry even on max details. The control scheme is god-awful, can't really find any other words to describe it; combat should work on a dodge-counterattack basis but it's almost impossible to defeat the enemies when the input lag is off the chart.

I also experienced many glitches and bugs in just a handful of hours of playthrough, like enemies hitting you through the wall and random hard-crashes, especially during combat.
Be aware that, being an old-school survival game, you aren't allowed to save your progress at your convenience, but only in certain spots, so the risk of losing potentially hours of gameplay due to the crashes and bugs of this horrible port is even scarier than the monsters themselves.

The only way to enjoy the rather intriguing storyline without losing your sanity is either watching a longplay made by someone else or speedrunning and cheesing your way through the boss fights.","Probably one of the worst PC ports of all time.

This is obviously an attempt to cash-in on the movie as well as the second installment via fan service and call-backs. There's not a whole lot about this game that is original to itself, and some of WHAT IS isn't very good. 

It's been stated by anyone who talks about this game that mechanically, the gameplay is sound and intuitive, and throws out the tank controls for a better experience, but takes away from the horror when you're far more likely to survive because your character is a quote/unquote -badass-. 

I'll agree that it isn't the worst, and manages to at least stay somewhat true to its roots when being transported to the nightmare realm, unlike Downpour with it's -black hole- of death chases that got very tiresome, very quickly.

Speaking of Downpour, here's the thing. I liked Downpour more than this game overall. The character was stronger, and the story was more interesting to me. In fact, THIS game is one of the weakest as far as stories go in the games. It just felt bland and mostly forgettable. Alex's bemoaning of his lost brother, the generic female love-interest that I couldn't care less about, token black-guy, and the terribly over-the-top murder cult that basically showed the studio wanted to work on a SAW game than a Silent Hill game (The SAW games were garbage, too, so no surprised there). 

I guess if you're a Silent Hill fan, you'll pick this up regardless. 

Well, BUY THE CONSOLE VERSION. Whoever ported this over to PC didn't know what they were doing, or were rushed to get it ""kinda"" working on PC. It runs like crap and frequently crashes. I don't know if there's any patches to make it work BETTER on PC, so buy at your own risk.","It's sad when a great franchise is shifted to hang on a poor movie's ""hype"" to try and bump up the advertisements.

60541314,english,2019.11.25 22:50,❌,✅,0.534534514,3,"As much as it pains me to downvote a Silent Hill game, I just cannot recommend it. I've tried to like it, I've tried to be forgiving, but this game is so very broken in so many ways. 

For starters, the sound quality is the most bizarre thing. There are times when you feel as if you are underwater, all the sounds muted and distorted. Other times sound effects say ''hi there, screw you'' and just don't appear at all. For example, you can force the door open in perfect silence. Or you can listen to a recording that just cuts off the sound, but you know it should be still ongoing, as the subtitles are still there for a couple of sentences. Oh, and subtitles don't always match the pace of the voice acting. Obviously, lip-syncing is a big 'no no' most of the times, too. And do you know that some characters speak with their mouths closed, while others have a strange habit of speaking with a lot of awkward teeth action? What the heck is going on there?

Next, regarding level design... Why are there so many places that have absolutely no purpose? These places are like a random alley that ends with a wall, nothing to see there. Or a ladder you can climb for absolutely nothing. Or a corridor to another wall. Or a drop where there is (you've guessed it!) - nothing. It's just straight bad level design, I say. I could understand if the gamedevloppers wanted the player to feel disoriented or lost, but that's not the case here, or doesn't seem to be - the game is awfully linear. Usually, I don't have a problem with linear games, but in SH:H it was just another thing that had my feathers ruffled.
And are you seriously blocking a door with a mattress? A MATTRESS? Are you SERIOUS? Does the protagonist have arms so frickin' frail that he can't lift it off the floor? Or blocking a way with a swing chair - really, game? It's unmovable, I catch your drift. Not.

Also, I've been really irked by how many things have been 'borrowed' from the previous games and - if I'm correct - also from the movies. I can understand a tribute here and there, but it doesn't feel like a tribute - it feels like having no ideas for creating a unique gaming experience. Although, I will admit that there WERE a few things that seemed... well, maybe not fresh, but well-made and sort of memorable. But certainly not enough to overcome the general blandness.

And... the controls. They feel so stiff and awkward. Also, perhaps it's just me and I just couldn't get the mechanics down, or perhaps I've screwed myself because I've dived into Hard mode right away, I just couldn't get dodging to be perfect. No matter how many times I've tried to figure out why it keeps happehing, no matter how hard I've tried for perfect timing, sometimes Alex will lose health despite performing a dodge, or just get blown away during a dodging action. Other times he will dodge right into enemies or an incoming attack. I've done my best to make him dodge in other directions by pressing A/D or tilting the camera, by changing his position in regards to his foes, anything, but NO, he will dodge however he wants to, consequences be screwed. The only 100% successful option seems to be dodging backwards, but then he will be too far away from his enemies and he will need to take his sweet little time to walk back up to them, so VERY slowly. Sure, just take your time, Alex. No problem at all. It's not like other surrounding enemies are trying to claw your insides out or just screw you over. Go for a stroll, why won't you.

Also, this is the very first game I've seen where guns and more than half of other weapons are almost useless. The very first weapon of the game - the knife - is the holly grail of SH:H. It's hands down the best combat option for most of the time. And that's just... disheartening.  

You know what else is disheartening? The constant CRASHING. 
I have never had anything else crash as often as SH:H. Sometimes it will crash while trying to start it, sometimes going back to the desktop, but more often than not making the whole computer freeze and forcing me restart it, over and over again. Other times the crash will happen during loading time, while switching in-game locations - and how lovely is that when savepoints can be quite rare at certain places! Imagine my joy crashing and losing all the progress, then trying to start the game again and having it freeze while launching, so that you need to restart the computer, sometimes once, sometimes multiple times.
I'm not counting all the in-game little freezes.
So just... no. This game frustrated me so very much. I wanted to like it. I mean... it's a Silent Hill game. One of my favourites. There were some upsides, too - like some of the music (for example Scarlet's theme), neat monster design, truly quite a few things that were done right - but I'm so overcome with all the downsides, that it can't be anything else but a downvote from me.

58491374,english,2019.10.29 02:45,✅,✅,0.5,0,"I'm that one person, who read about the story of the SH games, but only had the chance to play SH2 so far (and I liked it), so that's what I can compare this to at the moment. It would be possible to review the game by itself, but I'm still going to compare it to SH2, simply because it copy-pasted a lot of stuff from it. 
SH:H was a mixed product for me, it's not necessarily horrible, but it's not amazing, either. 
The good: The graphics are mostly okay, except some character models. Some things look very nice, some things look like utter trash. Some monster designs are pretty cool and freaky. The atmosphere is nice, I really liked it. Some parts of the plot are nice, sad and dramatic. The voice acting is ok, it's nothing special. The puzzles are fine, but you cannot choose their levels like in the other one. 
The meh: Combat system. I didn’t hate the combat, but this game is mostly action based, not really psychology based. It is possible to run past some enemies, but not all of them. There is barely any ammo for the guns. In SH2, I had literally 200+ ammo at the point I reached the last PH boss fight, but here I usually had around 15 ammo at most, if I even had any. I didn’t like the melee fight, because the stun time is way too long and gets you killed easily. There was a point, when I used the game’s stupid flaws to fight. One type of enemy couldn’t get through doors, so I stood at the door and killed it with the axe, because I could hit it from there, but it couldn’t hit me. Then I found a way to always win in melee fights: there is no need to use tactics, just mash the dodge button and the quick attack button at the same time like crazy. Nothing could kill me like that. It made the game way too easy, not even the bosses could kill me. 
Other meh thing for me is the rare save points. I hate that anyway, because you may even miss them, if you don’t check everything. I like exploring and checking everything, but even so, I think there are not enough save points during some levels. But the main problem about this comes later in the review. 
The endings and the sountrack are also in the meh category. There were so many songs from SH2 that I loved, the background music was so emotional and nice, here, I don't even remember any of them, except one main song. The endings are nothing special, they didn't make me feel anything and I don't like the way you can achieve them. I liked SH2's way of achieving endings more, here, it's more like choose between good or bad actions, like kill this guy or don't kill this guy. 
The bad: Even though I liked some parts of the plot, I noticed that it stole stuff from SH2 and the main plot twist was very predictable. The characters are horrible, boring and flat. I didn't care about any side characters. They were just kinda there to be there, while I pretty much liked everyone in SH2 (Well, I probably would have accidentally shot Laura after the hospital, if her scenes weren’t cutscenes, but I liked everyone else.) The main guy, Alex, isn't that bad, at least he made me feel something, but I think he could have been a much better character with more dialogues or inner thoughts or something. 
Then, there are the monsters. The bosses have meanings behind them and that's pretty cool, some of the smaller monsters have, too, then there is one that is a complete copy of the Lying Figure from SH2 with a different skin. There are also human enemies...? Then, the main problem, Pyramid Head and the nurses appear for whatever reason. Mostly because it's fanservice and they are iconic and all, but they don't belong here, at all. I guess PH was supposed to be scary, but I laughed so much, when he literally appeared only to look at Alex and then left, like „Meh, this dude ain’t worth my time. Where is my man, James?”
Also, this game doesn't take place in SH, it's some other completely different town that kind of has the same power...? Anyway, only the last 25% of the game takes place in SH. I'm not sure about the other parts of the franchise, but I found it weird.
I also didn't like how the monsters were introduced in the game. Almost all of them have long cutscenes the first time they show up and I think that makes them less scary. If I remember correctly, in SH2, only the first monster had cutscene, other than that, all the others just suddenly appeared somewhere with no introduction and you had to react to them immediately, there was no time to observe them well during a cutscene. I think that's scarier. 
The worst: Crashes. So, about those rare save points I mentioned… Manual save or a lot of save points are needed in a game that has random crashes. At first, I didn’t understand what everybody was talking about in the reviews, because I didn’t have any crashes during the first two hours, then this happened: I fought a boss, then came the loading screen. The game crashed, I had to fight the boss again. Next scene came, I fought my way through it, then, at the next loading screen, the game froze and then crashed. I loaded it again, the gun or the enemies were bugged, because I couldn’t shoot them at all. I loaded the game three times, it was always the same result, then, after restarting the game a few times, it finally worked again. I loaded the game, started fighting my way through that part for the 6th time aaaaand the game crashed. I decided to quit. Fanmade fixing exists and normally I would think it's worth a negative review to be forced to install fanmade patches to fix a game... But I didn't end up installing the patch and this was the only time the game was such a crashing mess for me, other than that, it only crashed once later. So, in the end, it was not as horrible as I first thought it was going to be after that one point, I didn't lose any more progress and the game worked well. But I can imagine this being the worst problem for people who had many more crashes.
In the end, I think the game is an „okay” category. It's a mixed bag, it has stupid mistakes and flaws, it would have needed more original stuff and better characters instead of copy-pasting way too many things. It's certainly not that great, but I don't think it's utter trash. I understand that everyone is upset about PH chilling there for no reason and the crashes, but I think it gets more hate than it deserves. I was still interested in the plot and in finishing the game and it took around 10 hours. It's not worth the full price, (because crashes, that's why) but on sale, it's ok.","I'm that one person, who read about the story of the SH games, but only had the chance to play SH2 so far (and I liked it), so that's what I can compare this to at the moment.

En ésta ocasión nos tocará ser Alex Shepherd, un pibe re fachero que la tiene re clara gracias a nosotros y como es militar sabe varios tipos de combate cuerpo a cuerpo incluyendo la manipulación de todo tipo de armas de fuego tales como pistolas, escopetas, rifles, un capo el shepe.
Cuestión, Alex es herido en batalla y se lo translada a un hospital medio pelo en donde más temprano que tarde nos damos cuenta que hay algo raro en ese lugar. Lo llevan a su habitación pero Alex cagado de miedo se escapa y empieza a tener delirios cósmicos con su hermano menor, Joshua. Pim pum pam, nos encontramos un cuchillo y empezamos a fakear enfermeras a lo loco (O esconderse en la oscuridad que es más divertido y le da un toque más de suspenso) hasta volver a encontrar a Joshua que se vive encerrando en habitaciones y solamente abrirá la puerta si le damos su muñeco de peluche. Le damos el muñequito pero el pibe dice ""No pará bro, éste no es mi muñeco, nos re vimo' logi"" y se nos vuelve a escapar. Mágicamente se abre la puerta, tomamos un ascensor anda a saber a donde y de la nada sale una tremenda espada que nos perfora el torso. Y se despierta nuestro protagonista en el camión de Travis (Protagonista de Silent Hill Origins), éste nos llevará a la ciudad en donde comenzará nuestra ""aventura"".
Una vez habiéndonos despedido de Travis y éste mirándonos con una mirada que nos dice ""Uh papá, te van a romper el esfinter acá, yo ya pasé por esto"" comenzamos a vagar por el pueblo ""Shepherd´s Glen,"" en donde podemos notar que una densa neblina nos priva de nuestra visión siendo éste sentido afectado y disminuido, la ciudad, sin sospecharlo demasiado entendemos que quedó desierta por algo que nos va a hacer re cagar en el futuro y cuando no podía pasar nada más raro nos topamos con la jueza Margaret Holloway, una rubia media come pebetes que nos dice que somos re facheros y que las cosas en la ciudad han cambiado para peor, nos recomienda ir de visitas a casa y tomar unos mates con nuestra madre. Nos vamos para casa y al ingresar podemos notar varias anomalías que nos hacen sospechar de que algo no está bien, después de estar media hora dando vueltas por la casa nos encontramos a la madre de Alex y ella nos explica mejor la situación. Ocurrieron cosas cuando Alex estaba en el servicio militar y Joshua desapareció, ante ésta situación el padre de Alex (Que también es medio militar y por lo visto era un sorete con Alex) salió a buscarlo pero tampoco volvió. Al obtener información de lo ocurrido nuestro protagonista lo relaciona con el sueño del hospital y ahí se da cuenta que su hermano está en peligro con lo cual decide salir a buscarlo. 
Durante el recorrido por las ciudades (Shepherd´s Glen y Silent Hill) encontraremos muchos personajes que serían sobrevivientes de lo que ocurre ahí y éstos nos darán una oportuna ayuda en distintos momentos del juego que ayudarían a complementar algunos baches de la historia o dar información complementaria que está re piola. Además de personajes encontraremos un sin fin de momentos de terror y suspenso, muchos monstruos, muchos puzzles típicos de las sagas de Silent Hill, típico soundtrack épico de las sagas, que si bien a mí me gustan menos que a comparación de los silent hill 1,2,3,4, siguen estándo muy buenos pero lo que hace genial a este juego y todos los silent hills (subjetivo) es la historia acompañado de los momentos que nos hacen vivir, ese hueco en la historia que se va completando lentamente por deducción o por cierta información complementaria que se puede lograr interpretar a medida que avanzamos en el juego y resolvemos los problemas que se nos atraviesan. Si bien en el final se nos aclara todo en todo el gameplay vivimos con la duda y nuestra única herramienta para entender la trama es nuestro poder de deducción y a partir de ahí se hace un poco subjetivo el juego (Sin contar las millones de simbologías que éste posee).
En mi opinión Silent Hill Homecoming no es el mejor Silent Hill que se creó pero porque las entregas anteriores son obras de arte, éste juego también es una obra de arte con tremenda historia y soundtrack por lo que se me hace media odiosa la comparación, los giros argumentales que posee, cómo todo lo que venimos deduciendo se nos cae a pedazos y la forma en que asimilamos la nueva información hace que se nos venga el mundo abajo ahre.
Para aquella persona que jamás jugó Silent Hill se lo recomiendo, es un juego de terror con una gran historia, una gran experiencia si se sabe interpretar y entender la situación en donde nos plantea el juego. La soledad y convivir con el temor del personaje hasta haber terminado su misión en el pueblo maldito.

El más importante es que se crashea a veces, y para jugarlo a 60 FPS tuve que instalar un parche... 

El juego tiene una trama que a mi me enganchó, la ambientación está OK, pero su sistema de combate me pareció horrible, además estuvo mal que incluyeran enemigos del SH 2, pese a todo ello, me pareció un juego digno y no me pareció malo como algunos dicen. Lo que sucede es que si se compara a sus predecesores japoneses, no tiene nada que hacer, sobretodo si se le compara a Silent Hill 1 o el Silent Hill 2, que tienen una historia y ambientación que son sublime, y que además son verdaderas obras maestras y de culto.

Recomiendo el juego con las justas.

My review is... Though criticised as the worst entry in the entire series, not only do I fail to see that, but I also fail to see it as a bad game full stop. Honestly, it's like everyone is biased against this entry just for being from an American team, could you really not have enjoyed it for what it is? Even if it was still the original team, would you really want every single entry to be exactly the same? 

Every single moment was entertaining to me! In fact, if I didn't wuss out, I would've had even more fun with the higher difficulty option! Yes, some monsters are unfair, such as the Schism having an instant-kill move, Needlers being undodgable (Seriously, I kept doing exactly what the game showed me worked and it didn't the moment I was halfway through the Hotel and it never worked for the rest of the game, is this a glitch? Needlers are the reason why I wussed out by the way), Ferals also being undodgable(?), Nurses having a stun-lock which essentially acts as an instant-kill move (though that's only if you try to kill them the wrong way, so it's fair), Smokers being outright annoying, etc. People complain that dodging as an option is fundamentally flawed in a Silent Hill... Unpopular opinion on my behalf, apparently, but no, it really isn't. In fact, this is where I take massive issue with the previous entries, a lot of monsters will continually drain resources if not dealt with so the least the game can do is test my skill so that it isn't being taken out on my Health and Ammo every single time if I simply prove as good at playing the game. Puzzles were very satisfying, except the birthstone puzzle requiring knowledge of gems, that the game doesn't provide, not even as a riddle, meaning looking it up or spending way too much time guessing. And both the 'match the 5 plates' and 'spinny circles' part 1, 2 and 3 puzzle having answers that, even after looking it up, don't make sense? Seriously, how is something that 'a man buys but doesn't use' NOT poison, yet somehow IS a coffin?!

Want to know what I would change about the game?

1) Fix the Laziness - Despite already making the code for achievements in literally every other version of this game, they were absent from the version I played on PC. Especially strange due to the rightful reputation for PC versions of games in general to be definitive. PC players also had to fix frame rate locks, graphical bugs, crashing and game-breaking glitches themselves, rather than a simple update being made. So, I would've made it so that these fixes came with the game and wouldn't strip features for no reason! This is the reason alone that my review isn't positive. If they wanted a positive review, they would've at least tired.

2) Add riddles for the birthstone puzzle so that it's actually possible to solve without outside knowledge! The riddle for the Sapphire could've been, as an example. ""The stone that makes a transcendence from hot summers to frigid winters (referencing September). The brilliant colour twinkles like a newborn eye (referencing the colour blue). Some say that the sky and ocean is God's blue blood, but in truth, it is the deprived (symbolising the tragedy).""

3) Dedicated block button - The amount of times that I wanted to block but there was no option, only occurring out of luck, wasn't good game design. It would be good game design if the unused right trigger button was given purpose as a block button! Now, in a future entry, blocking wasn't overpowered because of 2 reasons: weapons can break and you took damage anyway, just less than normal. In Homecoming, weapons don't break and I think taking damage anyway for successful blocks is bad game design. My solution around this is that some attacks can't be blocked, such as the heavy slams the Siam does. Others have counter attacks to blocking if you hold block for too long or the wrong moment entirely, perhaps the Schism could hook its axe-nose around your pipe and swipe you with its claws until you push it off with a few button mashes? Some enemies can be so fast that they can evade around you, such as Ferals. 

4) More endings - Ignoring that a lot of decisions don't affect the game as it unfolds or ends, the 3 choices that did should result in 9 total different endings, not just 5. Examples of endings that could exist and the conditions could be: 

'Soldier All Along', obtained by giving Alex's Mom mercy, his father no forgiveness and saving Wheeler. It will be like the good ending, until interrupted by an Order Enforcer (bad person), who almost drives a pipe through Elle, but is abruptly stopped by a gunshot to the head. This is revealed to be one of a handful of Alex's soldier friends because it wasn't a delusion, it was real! Alex rests a shoulder on his friend, relieved that he wasn't insane, at least the way he thought. The scene zooms out as he explains who his new pal and girlfriend are to his army mates before finally going black and credits rolling. He lost his blood brother, but he has brothers in the force!

'Josh Lives' - Obtained by forgiving the Dad, not giving mercy to the Mom (which will be out of weakness instead of resentment depending on how you build Alex's character prior to the decision. Needs to be out of weakness specifically.) and save Wheeler. Because of the forgiveness and pure-heart Alex shows despite who he once was, the evil force of the town gifts back Josh, as well as the many other sacrificed children. Elle, Alex and Wheeler establish Shepherd's Glen Foster Home! The scene ends with a group photo of all the kids and adults. 

'Josh Lives, at a Cost...' - Obtained by not forgiving, mercying mom out of wanting her to die by your hands personally rather than kindness and not saving Wheeler. Alex realises how much of a bad person he is and uses the sacrificial dagger to kill himself. He then falls beside Josh and apologises. Alex's blood touches Josh, and thanks to the town's magick seeing this as redemption (just to a lesser degree), Josh has his life given back. We see him wonder out of a Shepherds Glen that's been restored from the curse, picked up by the trucker guy from the beginning of the game. The trucker asks questions, but Josh doesn't remember anything about anyone or himself, he's a fresh slate who doesn't have to be tormented by his past! They drive off to an orange sky, night approaching.

'Party' - This ending is achieved not by the 3 major decisions, but by the character building decisions. If Alex's character is morally neutral, not kind or fussy, this ending will be triggered. It will feature him killing himself, but this time he goes to a purgatory that looks like a half-decorated party room, with characters from across the entire series being featured. James Sunderland, a fan favourite, will explain that everything's good and that they're setting up for the release of a friend of all of theirs. This is in reference to Murphy, the protagonist of Downpour, and this is to tie all the games together as a canonical ending, even if silly.","I thought you guys were exaggerating, how can it crash THIS much?!

My review is... Though criticised as the worst entry in the entire series, not only do I fail to see that, but I also fail to see it as a bad game full stop. Honestly, it's like everyone is biased against this entry just for being from an American team, could you really not have enjoyed it for what it is? Even if it was still the original team, would you really want every single entry to be exactly the same? 

Every single moment was entertaining to me! In fact, if I didn't wuss out, I would've had even more fun with the higher difficulty option! Yes, some monsters are unfair, such as the Schism having an instant-kill move, Needlers being undodgable (Seriously, I kept doing exactly what the game showed me worked and it didn't the moment I was halfway through the Hotel and it never worked for the rest of the game, is this a glitch? Needlers are the reason why I wussed out by the way), Ferals also being undodgable(?), Nurses having a stun-lock which essentially acts as an instant-kill move (though that's only if you try to kill them the wrong way, so it's fair), Smokers being outright annoying, etc. People complain that dodging as an option is fundamentally flawed in a Silent Hill... Unpopular opinion on my behalf, apparently, but no, it really isn't. In fact, this is where I take massive issue with the previous entries, a lot of monsters will continually drain resources if not dealt with so the least the game can do is test my skill so that it isn't being taken out on my Health and Ammo every single time if I simply prove as good at playing the game. Puzzles were very satisfying, except the birthstone puzzle requiring knowledge of gems, that the game doesn't provide, not even as a riddle, meaning looking it up or spending way too much time guessing. And both the 'match the 5 plates' and 'spinny circles' part 1, 2 and 3 puzzle having answers that, even after looking it up, don't make sense? Seriously, how is something that 'a man buys but doesn't use' NOT poison, yet somehow IS a coffin?!

Want to know what I would change about the game?

1) Fix the Laziness - Despite already making the code for achievements in literally every other version of this game, they were absent from the version I played on PC. Especially strange due to the rightful reputation for PC versions of games in general to be definitive. PC players also had to fix frame rate locks, graphical bugs, crashing and game-breaking glitches themselves, rather than a simple update being made. So, I would've made it so that these fixes came with the game and wouldn't strip features for no reason! This is the reason alone that my review isn't positive. If they wanted a positive review, they would've at least tired.

2) Add riddles for the birthstone puzzle so that it's actually possible to solve without outside knowledge! The riddle for the Sapphire could've been, as an example. ""The stone that makes a transcendence from hot summers to frigid winters (referencing September). The brilliant colour twinkles like a newborn eye (referencing the colour blue). Some say that the sky and ocean is God's blue blood, but in truth, it is the deprived (symbolising the tragedy).""

3) Dedicated block button - The amount of times that I wanted to block but there was no option, only occurring out of luck, wasn't good game design. It would be good game design if the unused right trigger button was given purpose as a block button! Now, in a future entry, blocking wasn't overpowered because of 2 reasons: weapons can break and you took damage anyway, just less than normal. In Homecoming, weapons don't break and I think taking damage anyway for successful blocks is bad game design. My solution around this is that some attacks can't be blocked, such as the heavy slams the Siam does. Others have counter attacks to blocking if you hold block for too long or the wrong moment entirely, perhaps the Schism could hook its axe-nose around your pipe and swipe you with its claws until you push it off with a few button mashes? Some enemies can be so fast that they can evade around you, such as Ferals. 

4) More endings - Ignoring that a lot of decisions don't affect the game as it unfolds or ends, the 3 choices that did should result in 9 total different endings, not just 5. Examples of endings that could exist and the conditions could be: 

'Soldier All Along', obtained by giving Alex's Mom mercy, his father no forgiveness and saving Wheeler. It will be like the good ending, until interrupted by an Order Enforcer (bad person), who almost drives a pipe through Elle, but is abruptly stopped by a gunshot to the head. This is revealed to be one of a handful of Alex's soldier friends because it wasn't a delusion, it was real! Alex rests a shoulder on his friend, relieved that he wasn't insane, at least the way he thought. The scene zooms out as he explains who his new pal and girlfriend are to his army mates before finally going black and credits rolling. He lost his blood brother, but he has brothers in the force!

'Josh Lives' - Obtained by forgiving the Dad, not giving mercy to the Mom (which will be out of weakness instead of resentment depending on how you build Alex's character prior to the decision. Needs to be out of weakness specifically.) and save Wheeler. Because of the forgiveness and pure-heart Alex shows despite who he once was, the evil force of the town gifts back Josh, as well as the many other sacrificed children. Elle, Alex and Wheeler establish Shepherd's Glen Foster Home! The scene ends with a group photo of all the kids and adults. 

'Josh Lives, at a Cost...' - Obtained by not forgiving, mercying mom out of wanting her to die by your hands personally rather than kindness and not saving Wheeler. Alex realises how much of a bad person he is and uses the sacrificial dagger to kill himself. He then falls beside Josh and apologises. Alex's blood touches Josh, and thanks to the town's magick seeing this as redemption (just to a lesser degree), Josh has his life given back.

Let me just say that I’m a huge Silent Hill fan. Silent Hill 2 was the game that first got me into the horror genre, and I have never been the same since. But I’m not here to discuss what makes one a “true” fan, I’m here to discuss why Silent Hill: Homecoming isn’t a good Silent Hill game. Perhaps it might be considered good horror by some, but for anyone who has played and loved the first 3-4 titles in the series, and perhaps found themselves obsessing over the depths and intricacies of the stories at one time or another, they’ll get none of that here. Homecoming is a shallow interpretation of what Japanese horror is, and it fails horribly at almost every single thing it attempts to accomplish.

The story itself starts off promising enough with our protagonist, Alex Shepherd, waking up to find himself in a hospital where patients are horribly tortured and mutilated, their remains tossed about like so much meaningless flesh. Upon waking from what is clearly a nightmare, we find Alex in the cabin of a trucker (Travis from Origins), who is giving him a lift back home to Shepherd’s Glen after having just been discharged from military service. There he discovers the town isn’t exactly how he left it, nor is his family. 

One would think uncovering the mystery behind what happened to Alex's little brother would be terrifying, but it’s not. Almost every horror trope in the book is summoned forth here, at least when the lore from the previous games isn't being bastardized.  Homecoming is what Japanese horror looks like if you shove it through the lens of a Western game developer; the symbolism is blatant, everything is over-explained, and there is a reliance on action over atmosphere, which is the biggest mistake a game in this series could possibly make.

Silent Hill is not about combat. It never has been. It’s about the dread of what you’ll be witnessing next. It’s about the unknown and what horrors it holds. It’s about seeing fucked up shit and trying to understand how, or why, that fucked up shit even exists. It’s not getting bombarded by monsters. It’s not fighting through gauntlets of fiends. It’s not fighting bosses over and over and over again because the combat system doesn’t allow you to attack something unless you’re locked onto it. It’s not having to dodge attacks with absolute precision in order to avoid them. It’s not having an artificial limit on how many bullets you can carry even though your melee weapons are 9 times out of 10 the better option.

Even the soundtrack feels bland and phoned in. Sure, the vocal themes are great, mostly because they’re held up by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn's fantastic performance, but there are few memorable tracks outside of the ending and opening themes and a couple of melodies we hear repeated throughout the game. The rest of it is all just…forgettable noise.

I could honestly continue on for several more paragraphs going into how much I hate that they ripped several things straight out of the first movie, how embarrassingly “wink wink, nudge nudge” all of the game’s Easter Eggs are, how much I abhor that Alex is basically another James Sunderland, but I just want to be done with this garbage and move on. No, I would NOT recommend Silent Hill: Homecoming to anyone who loved the earlier games in the series. But if you were to find yourself compelled to play this train wreck, even out of morbid curiosity, make sure you install that patch, adjust your sound settings, and go in with your expectations duly deflated. Maybe then, if you’re lucky, you’ll get some fleeting enjoyment out of it.

It takes literally 5 minutes to install, and I've had 0 crashes or other problems throughout my whole playtime after installing it.

Now, on to the game itself. I must first say that I haven't played the early installments in the series too much, but have mostly resorted to watching walkthroughs of them, which may have affected my perception. But gee, didn't I find this game amazing! I loved almost everything about it, beginning with the ambiance, the soundtrack, the monster design (which is really diverse and cool), the story, the weapons, all the way to the diverse environments and the transitions to the Otherworld.

The only real issue I've had with the game is that it has ridiculously few save points, and they are placed at a freakin' gigantic distance from one another (I once had to play for a whole f***ing hour without saving, holy fuck). This makes the game incredibly frustrating if you die.


PROS:
+AMAZING ATMOSPHERE AND STORY
+diverse environments
+incredibly scary and tense at some points
+lots of plot twists
+diverse, creepy, and original monsters
+diverse and neat weps
+exploration is encouraged, as there are a lot of secrets to discover

CONS:
-save points are ridiculously few and far between
-I haven't checked properly, but there doesn't seem to be a proper in-game checkpoint system either


NEUTRAL:
~combat might seem a bit weird in the beginning, but it's not that difficult to get used to (dodging and targeting is a mess though, I admit that)
~nothing impressive about the graphics, but I believe it's also not really expectable from such an old game


Overall, I'd say the game is a must-buy (yes, even the Steam version. In fact, I do recommend you to buy it here, as it might give Konami an idea that the PC community is also important. You may never know).


TL;DR: It's Silent Hill through and through. Ignore the complaints about the technical issues (they're very easily fixable with a community patch) and just buy it already :D","First of all, let me be clear about something: the technical issues are completely irrelevant due to the amazing patch made by Unknownproject and his collaborators.

I must first say that I haven't played the early installments in the series too much, but have mostly resorted to watching walkthroughs of them, which may have affected my perception. But gee, didn't I find this game amazing! I loved almost everything about it, beginning with the ambiance, the soundtrack, the monster design (which is really diverse and cool), the story, the weapons, all the way to the diverse environments and the transitions to the Otherworld.

The only real issue I've had with the game is that it has ridiculously few save points, and they are placed at a freakin' gigantic distance from one another (I once had to play for a whole f***ing hour without saving, holy fuck). This makes the game incredibly frustrating if you die.


PROS:
+AMAZING ATMOSPHERE AND STORY
+diverse environments
+incredibly scary and tense at some points
+lots of plot twists
+diverse, creepy, and original monsters
+diverse and neat weps
+exploration is encouraged, as there are a lot of secrets to discover

CONS:
-save points are ridiculously few and far between
-I haven't checked properly, but there doesn't seem to be a proper in-game checkpoint system either


NEUTRAL:
~combat might seem a bit weird in the beginning, but it's not that difficult to get used to (dodging and targeting is a mess though, I admit that)
~nothing impressive about the graphics, but I believe it's also not really expectable from such an old game


Overall, I'd say the game is a must-buy (yes, even the Steam version. In fact, I do recommend you to buy it here, as it might give Konami an idea that the PC community is also important. You may never know).


TL;DR: It's Silent Hill through and through. Ignore the complaints about the technical issues (they're very easily fixable with a community patch) and just buy it already :D"

Mas também recomendo a versão de console, porque a versão de pc tem bugs! Acontece uns travamento que não tem a ver com seu computador, é da versão do jogo mesmo. O jogo fica uns 20 segundos +- travado e aí volta ao normal. Mas é só em alguns momentos raros. Melhor comprar a versão do PS3

Pontos positivos desse jogo: a trilha sonora é bem bonita em alguns pontos e, em outros, a trilha é assustadora / sistema de esquiva e cambalhota + técnicas de combate. Como o Alex não é um simples civil, então ele tem habilidades que outros protagonistas da saga não tem. /  Esse jogo é o mais ""violento"" da saga. É o que mais tem gore, sabe? As cenas de morte são mais explícitas.

Quanto aos pontos negativos, existem vários. Eu não sei nem por onde começar.
Acho que os produtores, num modo geral, não souberam desenvolver um jogo pra recem então plataforma da época, Xbox 360 / PS3. 
É engraçado porque eu conheço outros jogos que pegaram o comecinho dessa era do PS3 e parece que os produtores não souberam desenvolver os jogos de um jeito decente. 

Começando com o lip synch. Olha, é estranho, mas os Silent Hills de PS2 tem um lip synch melhor que o Homecoming. Rostos inexpressivos.
Os gráficos também são estranhos. Por incrível que pareça, os do PS2 tem um gráfico, uma textura mais bonita que o do Homecoming. O SH3 e o SH4 por exemplo, se atualizassem as texturas pra HD numa remasterização, eles ficariam mil vezes mais bonitos que o Homecoming. E não é só isso, é os cenários também... os antigos tem mais detalhes, iluminação, profundidade e sombras mais trabalhados que o Homecoming, sei lá... 

Eu não sei se isso é ponto positivo ou negativo, mas nesse jogo, tudo que o Alex esbarra, o objeto é jogado pros lados/pra trás. Tipo: cadeiras tombam, se arrastam, caem... Ás vezes isso assusta, mas às vezes irrita.

Outro vacilo, que chega até ser cômico, é o símbolo dos comandos kkkkk Aparece lá o mesmo símbolo pra tudo! (Que é o símbolo do save game). Você tem que memorizar os comandos pelo menu, porque quando aparece lá ""menu / inventory"" ta tudo com o mesmo símbolo. E até hoje não sei direito qual é o botão de voltar no file kkkkk

Acho que a posição da câmera, sempre atrás da cabeça do Alex, piorou a situação. Como nos outros a câmera ficava mais acima, em vários ângulos, aí dava uma perspectiva melhor ao jogo.

Outro ponto negativo é a atuação de voz. Putz. Às vezes os personagens falam de um jeito como se tivessem lendo um papel.  Não souberam dirigir os atores, e em momentos que os personagens estão correndo, os atores falaram de um jeito bem normalzão.

A câmera de combate também é péssima. A câmera se posiciona exatamente atrás da cabeça do Alex, mano. Não dá pra enxergar o bicho na frente dele às vezes. A batalha com a Scarlet (boss fight) foi triste porque eu comandava o Alex pra esquivar  pra esquerda e ele esquivava pra direita e vice-versa. Às vezes o Alex fica esfaqueando o ar também. Mas não sei se isso acontece na versão de console.
Quando você saca a arma, você não pode acessar o menu direito. Então você tem que desligar a opção de combate/sacar a arma. Se fosse ligado à pressão de um botão, seria mais dinâmico, né. Não da pra acessar nem o mapa assim. E como o Alex fica olhando pro monstro como o centro da atenção, não tem como voce virar o alex pra correr pra direção contrária sem antes desligar o modo combate/sacar arma

Os saves são escassos comparado aos dos anteriores. Senti que tive que percorrer um caminho longo até achar um save, várias vezes. Rola uma travadinha básica na hora de salvar também.

Tive a sensação que esse Silent Hill foi o maior de todos. Se não é, então ele dá essa impressão. 

Outro ponto negativo é a limitação de munições. Tipo, se você pega uma quantidade x de munição, você não pode mais pegar! E isso é bem chato porque não é sempre que aparece munições. O jogo nem te permite economizar bastante.

Quanto à história, eu não posso falar muito sem dar spoiler porque esse jogo tentou preservar muitos detalhes para poder entregar o plot twist no final. Acho que por esse motivo, o jogo ficou meio arrastado, sabe? Você vai jogando, jogando... sem saber o que está acontecendo, sem saber o porquê das coisas, sem pegar a lógica de tudo... O problema é que tantos detalhes da história foram preservados que você joga de 50 a 70% da história do jogo sem entender o que está acontecendo, o porquê... Pra falar a verdade, só entendi por completo no final.

Nesse jogo, os files não são colecionáveis. Isso pesa muito pro entendimento do jogo! Às vezes você não pode parar pra ler um papel com um bicho pulando em você. E o conteúdo do papel faria mais sentido sendo relidos no final, né.
Os comentários dos lugares são contínuos, sem pausa. Significa que você não consegue ler os comentários/pensamentos do Alex sobre um banco, por exemplo, sem ser atacado por um bicho porque o jogo não congela como no SH1.
E os desenhos do Josh são a mesma coisa que nada. né.

Esse e o Silent Hill 2 são os únicos que tiveram plot twist e o Pyramid Head. O Pyramid Head apesar de ter uma fama na fandom e na saga, ele não aparece muito em ambos os jogos. E no Homecoming, ele aparece menos ainda que no 2. Ele nem tem um papel decente nesse e sua aparição fica misteriosa (pra não dizer mal explicada).

A história, mesmo após a revelação do plot twist no final, continua confusa. E apesar dos vários finais que existem (típico da saga), não da pra saber direito qual é canon! Eles são muito distintos uns dos outros! Porque, por exemplo, no SH1, SH2 e SH4, os finais seguem uma linha, uma lógica. A diferença é sutil  e pertinente. No Homecoming, alguns finais envolvem personagens que já morreram, finais sem lógica (?). Até o final UFO, coitado, que serve como alívio cômico na saga, foi simples e mal feito. E pela primeira vez, ele vem como possibilidade de ser pego de primeira (diferente dos outros que é um final bônus que você só pode pegar na segunda vez que jogar e fazendo algo especial)

Pra ser sincera, eu acho que a própria história do Homecoming é tão confusa que cria um plot hole desnecessário. No Silent Hill Origins, 1 e 3, houve um enredo sobre pacto. Aí chega o 5 e mete uma outra história de pacto que fica inevitável se perguntar onde o Zero/1 se encaixa nisso tudo. E afinal de contas, qual é a verdadeira história do Alex no final? O pai dele estava certo? Olha, eu acho péssimo quando uma história é mal explicada a ponto da gente precisar ler wikia na internet. 

Esse jogo possui escolhas de diálogos pela primeira vez na saga. Porém, diferente do que imaginei, as escolhas dos diálogos não afetam muito o gameplay em 97% dos casos. E nos outros 3%, momentos que são decisivos pra modificar o final que você vai conseguir (e você não sabe quando que é sem um walkthrough ao lado), o jogo não deixa claro no diálogo, como uma dica, do que se trata aquela decisão. Tipo no confessionário (SH3 feelings), você escolhe uma fala (já que as duas opções pareciam normais de conversa e não escolhas) e de repente o diálogo segue um fio de discussão que automaticamente te forçou numa decisão que as vezes nem era aquela que voce queria. Ou quando aparece fulana e aparece aquelas opções e você fica perdido, porque o jogo ta mandando você escolher mas sem uma explicação do tipo ""olha, x vão fazer y, então voce precisa me ajudar porque [spoiler] não tem outra escolha[/spoiler]. Tipo isso. Aparece a cena e você fica perdido, o diálogo é raso e não entrega informações importantes pra decisão.

O jogo também tentou introduzir elementos do filme (que teve uma adaptação podre). Eles copiaram o efeito do lugar ficando alternativo e as enfermeiras.

Eu não queria dar ""sim"" nem ""não"" nessa análise. Só fico chateada com a quantidade de erros que os produtores cometeram.  Se você é fã da saga, logico que, como eu, você tem que/ vai jogar. Mas esteja preparado.",

Anyway about the gameplay and the story itself this is what I think...


THE GOOD:

- I loved SO much that in this SH your main character actually feel trained to FIGHT back and DODGE, I don't think it takes out anything from the style of SH because it's meant to be that way because it's him, Alex. It's not James Sunderland, it's not Harry Mason and so on... it's Alex!
- The locations OVERALL were really appealing and (most of) the monsters hold up to the past SH.
- It DOES feel like a SH game, in case you were worried because of some reviews that pushed you away, the atmosphere is well done, the monsters surprise you but always with the our fan beloved radio eheh (hate and love for it!)
- On Normal Mode ammo are plenty but just if used with cautions, I held back a lot on fire weapons and still ran almost out so... (but for me it's a good thing in horror games, especially SH lol)

THE NOT SO GOOD:

- Wish it was longer BUT 15 hours is average for many horror games I loved and it's not a fault but I feel like pointing it out because it saddened me to have finished it already eheh 
- I really felt like I wanted to be able to explore more buildings, the one available are good and all but they were less unique compared to the previous SH in my opinion.
- The puzzles were very easy besides some that required a little bit more reading and attention (maybe three or so out of all).
- the only character design that really stands out for me it's Alex, the main character, for some reason the others just look a little bland and forgettable (look wise, not talking about their personality!)



Well, that's all. Do I suggest this game to a SH fan (a not TOO PICKY one though :P)? YES. Do I suggest this game to people who don't know much about SH and never played any of the old ones (or played them and hated them)? Probably not, because despite the good graphics and a better camera control etc it is still the same kind of pace of every other SH games and I know many people can't stand the slow walking (Alex does run pretty good though compared to other SH characters) and ""emptiness"" of SH...but when you love the series you know exactly that that specific thing is what adds to the SH experience. 

Should you buy it full price? Honestly just because I had to go patch it myself with a fan made fix (which worked really good for me and I'll be forever in debt with that user!)...no but up to 10$ it's still a good deal imho.

[h1]Смотря на кучу клонов Резидента эта игра кажется верхом необычности.[/h1]

Ну у нас формула Сайлента в основном. Иди туда-то, сделай то-то, побей и так далее. В отличии от собратьев Хомкаминг более линейный и считай лишился открытого мира, есть конечно более менее большие локации, но смысла в них не сказать что бы много. Лишь небольшой эксплоринг. Но основной замес у нас в коридорах. Наверное почти вся игра это длинный коридор с врагами и загадками простыми.
Боёвка лучшая в серии это точно, ближний бой наконец-то стал похож на что-то нормальное и больше не возможности забить бедного монстрилу люстрой или вообще запинать. Тут разработчики видимо подумали больше чем 5 секунд и попытались хотя бы сохранить хоррор элементы. Ближний бой у нас основа, 3 разных оружия, с разными статами и монстры, которые по разному будут реагировать, а то и в ответ пропишут за не правильный выбор. Сам ближний бой из-за тактики, разных монстров и из разного количества, которые не стесняются атаковать толпой, становится весьма адреналиновым и напряжённым, а это учитывая что монстрилы и выглядят пугающе. В отличии от какого нибудь Калисто Протокола здесь как то и побыстрее и интереснее и хоррор атмосфера остаётся на месте.
Огнестрел отошёл на третий план. Его не много, не надо использовать часто и не всегда полезен. Иногда удобнее в ближний бой, чем палить с дробовика. Но что хорошо так это некоторые типы врагов, которых эффективно убивать только с далека, а кого-то наоборот. То есть нельзя прям забить на всёидти на пролом. Хотя боссы преймущественно огнестрелом.
Врагов хоть и маловато, но сойдут. От собак, то чертовщины с клинками которая блокирует постоянно. Есть где разгуляться в боях, хотя если 1 на 1 то весьма скучновато.
Боссы вот весьма не дурные, кроме некоторых. Вполне оригинальные идеи для битвы и весьма для хоррора необычные приёмы.


[h1]Сюжет ультра кринж, но при этом завлекает.[/h1]

Сама история по началу и правда интригует. Но чем дальше в глубь, тем больше вопросов. Что происходит, почему, почему персонажи тупят, шо за бред и главный: а где тут Сайлент Хилл? Конкретно Сайлент Хилл тут больше привязан нитками, чем по факту есть, хотя это проблема серии начиная уже с 4 части. Тип он есть, но забейте.
Основа сюжетки хороша, из этого можно замутить классную историю и сценарист правда пытается, есть хорошие моменты, крутые повороты, которые реально запоминаются и желание узнать что же будет дальше. Но это рушится об кучу дурацких моментов, глупых и самое плохое: персонажей. Более тупых персонажей найти ну очень сложно. Они почти всегда творят дичь. Особенно меня добила сцена с главным героем который разговаривает с батей почти под конец игры, кто знает тот поймёт. Ну нельзя потенциально хорошую историю, с хорошими моментами и твистами так сливать. Это просто вау, так себе в ногу выстрелить.


[h1]Атмосферная плохая оптимизация.[/h1]

У игры весьма хорошо выдержана атмосфера. Потерянности, непонимания и тихого ужаса. Визуал прекрасно способствует этому, как и во всех играх серии, а музыка и звук шикарны, без них это было бы уже не то. Тут идеально.
Дизайн локаций хороший, конечно не всегда смогли дотянуть, но почти всегда на хорошем уровне. А вот дизайн монстров и боссов вау, прекрасно, причём это не просто с нифига, каждый имеет под собой что-то. В отличии от всяких зомби и мутантов тут и правда жуткие создания, даже медсёстры.
Графика для своего времени нормальная, как и сам порт в плане управления.
Но оптимизация плохая, всякие зависания, вылеты, вылеты во время сохранения (!!!) и просадки ФПС. Ну и баги конечно же. Очень неприятные.


[h1][b]Итог: и близко неидеальная игра, особенно ПК порт. Но она и правда затягивает, впечатляет и запоминается. А по среди кучи однотипных игр жанра эта прям лучик света.[/b][/h1]

Silent Hill Homecoming is an impressive game from the Silent Hill series that brings the horror of the original to a modern audience. With excellent graphics, sound, and a thrilling story, it’s easy to see why Silent Hill Homecoming is such a success.

The story of Silent Hill Homecoming follows Alex Shepherd, a soldier returning home to find his family missing. With no leads, Alex does the only thing he can; he follows a strange trail that appears to lead to a mysterious place called the Silent Hill.

The graphics in Silent Hill Homecoming are stunning. The game is still a horror title, so the camera and artstyle evoke an eerie atmosphere. In addition, the dark and depressing environments contribute to the disturbing atmosphere of the game, making you feel uneasy the further you explore.

The sound design in Silent Hill Homecoming is effective as well. The sound effects are spot-on, making you jump out of your seat as enemies appear or strange noises occur. Paired with a stellar soundtrack that mixes spooky ambience with intense rock and metal, you really get into the spirit of Silent Hill.

If you play this game specifically on a console I would think you’d enjoy this game a whole lot more than this PC port. Game-play wise the controls and the difficulty to re-wire your hands to hit certain buttons can make this infuriating. In addition to the difficulty of figuring out the button mapping you’ll find (maybe this is just me) but, hit boxes and general combat with enemies feels very sloppy. One of my biggest complaints with the combat though is that I typically found myself using only one weapon. The primary reason is ultimately because you can basically abuse the combat system. That one switch makes the Silent Hill Homecoming a cake walk to say the very least. From the so many cons of this game (poor combat mechanics, bad hit boxes, locked 30 fps, random crashes throughout,  unbelievably bad stuttering, you can not tab out and back in without a crash and, to finish it off poor scaling to 1440p) to the good.

Homecoming may be a sort of cookie cutter game compared to it’s brethren titles but, it’s not terrible by any means (besides the PC port version). Something that I think Silent Hill does better than other games is boss creations. Something about the way these games put together monsters and bosses is unnerving, from their movement to their stance. It’s very specifically done to look that way to give you a certain feeling.

Silent Hill serisinin 6. oyunu olmasına rağmen, aslında bu oyun tam anlamıyla bir Silent Hill oyunu değil. Neden mi? Öncelikle oyun [b]Team Silent[/b] 'ın yaptığı bir oyun değil. Silent Hill serisinde korku-gerilim aksiyona göre daha ön plandadır, yalnız Homecoming'de durum böyle değil (Allah'tan dram var oyunda). Ayrıca Silent Hill'de ki yaratıklar gerçek dünyada değil, başka bir boyutta ortaya çıkar ancak bu oyunda karakterimizin kendi yaşadığı kasabada da durum aynı, herkes de kasabayı böyle göremez be kardeşim hiç mi bir Silent Hill oyunu görmediniz ya da oynamadınız be. Yaratıklar; insanların [b]korkularını, suçlarını, ruhsal bunalımlarını ve daha önceden yaşadığı travmaları[/b] temsil eder yalnız bu oyunda bu o kadar da etkili olamamış ne yazık ki -herkes suçlu olamaz mq kasabasında çünkü-. Silent Hill herkesin normal bir biçimde gidebileceği bir kasaba da değil, suçlu olan birinin bir şekilde Silent Hill'e çağırılıp en kötü korkularıyla yüzleştiği -ya da cezasını çektiği- ve bir gerçeği öğrenemeden asla ayrılamayacağı bir yerdir (bir nevi kişinin kendi cehennemi gibi düşünebiliriz). Gerçekte oyundaki protagonistler (baş karakterler), dövüşmeyi pek bilmezler çünkü ellerine ilk kez silah alan sıradan insanlarla oynuyorduk, yalnız Homecoming'de ise karakterimiz bildiğiniz asker, ki bu durum oyunun korku-gerilim olmasından uzaklaşıyor biraz daha aksiyona kayıyor.

Oyuna girecek olursam; oyunu bir süre oynadıktan sonra ya anlık donup geri geliyor ya da atmaya başlıyor ve taa eski kayıttan devam ettiriyor bana, tam yeni silahlar aldım derken oyun küt gidiyo ve sinirlerimi bozuyo (bunun çözümünü bulursanız bana da bildirin lütfen), ayrıca FPS 60 olması gerekirken 30 da kitleniyor. 

[b]Herneyse özete gelelim...[/b]

Yıl 2007, asker Alex Shepherd bir savaşta yaralanmış ve hastaneye kaldırılmıştır. Hastanede olduğu sırada hem kayıp kardeşinin peşinden gitmiş hem de anlam veremediği bir sürü olaya tanıklık etmiştir. Kasabasına geri döndüğünde ise gerici bir sessizlik, sisle kaplanmış ve yaratıklar kol geziyor (vay anasını). Eve vardığında da yalnızca annesi vardır. Annesi de katatonik bir duruma girmiş ve oğluna, babasını ve kardeşini bulmasını söylemiştir. Yolculuk sırasında ise tüm bu olanların perdesi aralanacaktır.

Silent Hill'in öyküleri hep baş tacı olmuştur, yalnız bu oyun Silent Hill'in kendisinden epeyce uzak. Müziklerine laf yok o dramatizmi bozmamış en azından, yalnız adamlar 2. oyuna benzer bir oyun yapalım derken iyice berbat etmişler. En azından oyunda [u]Piramit reisi ve Hemşire bacılarını[/u] gördük (ki bunlar serinin simgeleri).

Uzun lafın kısası... Oyun bir korku oyunu olarak fena değil yalnız bir Silent Hill hiç değil. Serinin o kendine has gerilim havası az, yaratıkları herkes görebiliyor, olaylar kendi verdiğiniz kararlarla değil oyunun size sunduğu seçeneklerle sonuçlanıp öyle sona ulaşıyorsunuz. Bu oyunu bir korku oyunu olarak önerebilirim ama bir Silent Hill oyunu olarak önermiyorum. Keşke Konami Team Silent'ı kovmayıp seriyi batılı şirketlere satmasaydı, şu anda Silent Hill en az Resident Evil kadar ilgi görebilirdi.

[h1]Kazandığın paraları hak etmiyorsun KONAMI bunu da bil![/h1]

[b]3.5/10[/b] (Yarım puan çok vermemin nedeni oyunun müziklerini Akira Yamaoka abimiz yaptığı için.)

[i]I'm not sure what it all means, but we need to get to Silent Hill.[/i]

Każdy save spot to ulga a i te potrafią się zepsuć – dlatego nie należy nadpisywać tylko jednego i tegosamego slota na save.

Po powrocie okazuje się, że mieszkańcy miasteczka giną w tajemniczych okolicznościach, całe miasto osnuwa gęsta mgła, a na ulicach spotykamy makabryczne potwory, które nie mają wobec nas przyjaznych zamiarów.
Alex postanawia zrozumieć, o co chodzi i odnaleźć brata, niestety nie wie, że nie będzie to łatwe. Całe miasteczko powiązane jest w swój dziwny sposób z Silent Hill i kryje mroczną historię, w którą po części zamieszana jest jego własna rodzina.
Fabuła jest dobra, zdecydowanie chce się ją śledzić i poznać zakończenie, zwłaszcza że oferuje mały plot twist.

Homecoming to standardowy survival horror, który nie oferuje może nic oryginalnego i przełomowego, jeśli chodzi o serię czy gatunek. Ot, chodzimy, bijemy, rozświetlamy sobie drogę latarką, rozwiązujemy zagadki i dbamy o zapasy zdrowia i amunicji. Dużym plusem jest jednak o wiele wygodniejsze sterowanie w porównaniu do poprzedniczek, jak i całkiem dobrze działająca kamera.

Graficznie gra prezentuje się ładnie jak na 2008 rok. W niektórych momentach tekstury mogłyby być lepsze, ale ogólnie gra cieszyła oko. Były co prawda lepiej i gorzej zrobione modele czy pomieszczenia, ale nic, co mogłoby odstręczyć. Nie mam się naprawdę do czego doczepić.

Gra oferuje około 10 godzin rozgrywki i 5 zakończeń (w tym kultowe już z serii UFO), które po przejściu odblokowują nam nowe stroje i specjalne bronie w zależności od wyborów poczynionych w grze. A tych tym razem jest znacznie mniej i tu można się spokojnie domyślić co zrobić, żeby dostać to dobre zakończenie, żeby wszyscy ( no prawie ) żyli długo i szczęśliwie.

A kwestia muzyczna? To stary i dobry Akira Yamaoka, słychać wyraźnie jego ambientowe nuty i utwory wykonane w duecie z Mary Elizabeth, jednakże nie są one już tak mocną stroną serii, jak w poprzedniczkach. Utworów jest zdecydowanie mniej, a żaden nie przykuwa ucha na tyle, żeby puszczać sobie OST w wolnej chwili. Jednak podczas gry muzyka jest na dobrym poziomie i dodaje atmosfery doskonale tam, gdzie miała jej dodawać.

Podsumowując, uważam, że jest to dobry survival horror z unikalnym klimatem i wciągającą fabułą, którą zdecydowanie warto poznać. Zwłaszcza że dzięki poprawionemu sterowaniu gra się wygodnie i przyjemnie.",

The storyline is actually pretty good. Being a huge fan of the Silent Hill franchise, I was pretty satisfy with this one. Soundtrack is good has always <3 with the creepy atmoaphere we all like. That wouldn't be a Silent  Hill game without those two things.

I really did enjoy the creepy town plot evolving around each family of Shepherd's Glen. 
*Love the Travis Grady Cameo from Silent Hill Origins at the beggining of the game. <3*"

I have seen the two Silent Hill films (the second one was really bad) but have not played any of the games (with the exception of the arcade game) until now. I have gathered that fans of the series have mixed views on Silent Hill: Homecoming but I thought it was fantastic. I was very much reminded of the excellent Dead Space.

You play as Alex as you make your way around Shepherd's Glen in search of your missing brother. The place is almost a ghost town and is shrouded in a thick fog. Every now and then, you will come up against horrifying monsters. This is not an action game so expect the tension to build between encounters with creatures. The presentation is great as the game has a grainy look to everything. For the most part, the graphics are good but character animations during in-game cutscenes are sometimes poor and some of the textures on objects are a little underwhelming. Still, the game creates a very detailed environment and the atmosphere is chilling throughout. The eerie music helps make the game even more disturbing. You scavenge for items and try to conserve your ammo and health packs. The combat system may feel a little stiff but it suits the game well because this is a survival horror title, not an action game. There is some replay value as the game has multiple endings. Occassionally, I would encounter brief moments where the game would freeze and the loading times between areas are pretty annoying. However, I found the game ran quite smoothly overall.

Silent Hill: Homecoming is a brilliant survival horror game. I do not know if the other entries in the franchise are better but if they are anything like this game, I'm sure I would love them too. Games like this have to grab you with the atmosphere very quickly else you will get bored quickly. From the moment I started Silent Hill: Homecoming, I was hooked.

Silent Hill: Homecoming is a decent game that tried to continue on the franchise back when but it wasn't what we were all used to subsequently didn't make a lasting impression. The PC port? It was even worse, some even call unplayable.

PRO
- Interesting story but it feels somewhat cliche and doesn't have a big impact like 1, 2 or 3 did.
- The chilling and soothing music of Akira Yamoaka reminds us of the good days of Silent Hill.
- Creature designs are interesting if not a little less thought out and lacking symbolism than previous entries.
- Areas are classic looking Silent Hill with it's abandoned and foggy small town shrouded in mystery.

CON
- Audio is very unbalanced using a headset (and I assume speakers) where the speech comes out the left but sound effects and music comes out the right. Every other game works fine but SH:H is the only one that does this so I can only blame the game.
- Camera pans all over the place when interacting with certain items like it's not sure where to look.
- Long loading times occur when changing area's, preparing for a cutscene or even just spawning an enemy.
- Plenty of stuttering which occurs frequently.
- Facial animations just looks really weird and somewhat deformed giving everyone an ugly look.
- Fighting mechanics feel unfinished and annoying to use as some weapons are useless. For example, the knife is what you want to use mainly because you can stunlock enemies until they die. The pipe gives you a two hit combo with a slow cooldown so you'll most likely be hit straight after it.
- The physics can be weird and make enemies stretch and bounce as if made of rubber.
- Using an xbox pad makes the controls show up as numbers instead of it's corresponding symbol which gets very confusing.
- Sometimes the audio can be really quiet even with my volume as well as the game's at high levels. So I decided to put subtitles on...
- With the subtitles on they can show wrong dialogue. Little gripe I know but seems like something they could have easily checked.

It's a decent game for people who have a good interest in the Silent Hill series but if you're just looking for a classic survival horror game then maybe give this one a miss.

Con un Soundtrack bastante bueno, un muy buen diseño de monstruos a decir verdad y con una historia decente, Silent Hill Homecoming vale la pena a pesar de ser el juego mas FanService de la saga. Vale la pena por su Historia, Soundtrack, Ambientación y Monstros (En mi opinión los Monstruos y su transfondo son una de las mejores cosas que contiene esta entrega exepto Pyramid-Head y las enfermeras, que a pesar de que son monstruos muy queridos en la saga no tiene casi sentido o justificación de que esten aqui. El Soundtrack tambien es muy disfrutable si ya venias jugando desde el SH 2 o 3 te sentiras nostalgico con dicha banda sonora, otro factor importante o a favor en mi opinión del juego.) En cuanto a desempeño sufre varios fallos desde tener varios bugs, una tasa de FPS bastante estable pero que se limita a 30 y pues a decir verdad no culpo a su calidad grafica puesto que para su tiempo era de admirar pero ahora se ve un poco minimalista pero es algo que la atmosfera misma del juego le tapa y lo pone a favor.

No da tanto miedo como los anteriores es más un juego de acción y gore. La historia es de Alex que vuelve luego del servicio militar a su pueblo natal y se encuentra todo cambiado. Alex debe encontrar a su hermano Josh que ha desaparecido y desentrañar una serie de misterios acerca de su pasado, su pueblo y el vinculo de éste con Silent Hill. Gráficamente esta mejorado de eso puedo estar seguro pero el modo de combate con los monstruos me resulto muy complicado. Eso de prepararse para golpear a un monstruo es enredado debido a que uno puede morir frente a un monstruo sin poder defenderse si se te olvida poner el modo de combate antes de enfrentarse al monstruo lo que en los anteriores Silent Hill no pasaba. Además, hay muy poca munición y pocas medicinas y eso unido al modo de combate lo hace más complicado. El diseño de los monstruos esta bien. Finalmente, deje para el final del análisis lo que más me molesto del juego: Las cargas extremas que cada vez eran más largas a medida que el juego avanzaba. Eso unido a las caidas de fps, los crasheos y las pantallas congeladas en los puntos de guardado o cuando empieza algo nuevo en la historia fueron deteriorando el gozo del juego.

En lo que al apartado gráfico se refiere, el juego cumple con los estándares de su generación y es agradable de ver junto con una banda sonora que cumple con la temática ya que usa referencias de títulos anteriores. La historia no tiene un trasfondo verdaderamente interesante ya que Konami descuida muchos apartados de esta obra haciendo que al ver la fachada veamos un título serio pero que al jugarlo, se nota como va diluyéndose y mostrando sus grandes carencias.

Por mucho que Konami ha intentado exprimir sus sagas más icónicas como esta famosa y aclamada saga de juegos de terror psicológico, se ve a la legua que desde hace mucho, sus sagas tenían síntomas claros de agotamiento, debido a que como ha pasado con Silent Hill, usar clichés de obras anteriores hace que la gente siga interesada por tus nuevos lanzamientos. 

Sin embargo, si no se da un cambio importante por parte del equipo creativo, llegamos al punto en que se encuentra este Silent Hill Homecoming, a caballo entre querer formar nuevas historias pero tomando siempre como base las creaciones de obras anteriores. Esto provoca que el juego carezca de personalidad y acabe haciéndose tedioso y poco interesante al no tener una historia y una banda sonora que nos atrape ni unos buenos personajes que hagan que estemos espectantes de ver lo que sucede.

Como conclusión, este título no merece la pena comprarse ya que hay mejores opciones por el mismo o menor precio. Personalmente, yo compro este ya que si por casualidad algo de luz se hallara en Konami, quizás estas compras les anime algún día a sacar en la tienda de Steam los juegos anteriores de la saga u otros interesantes como los de la saga Metal Gear. Tristemente pienso que aunque esto se acabara dando, seguramente nos llevaríamos una mala adaptación como ya pasó con las remasterizaciones de Silent Hill ya que si algo nos ha demostrado Konami es que dinero y esfuerzo son ahora mismo dos cosas que no pueden ni quieren invertir.",

Pros:
historia boa
chefes altamente grotescos bem estilo silent hill mesmo
atmosfera bem medonha
personagens carismaticos com personalidades e pensamentos proprios
variedade grande de armas tanto brancas como de fogo
soundtrack LINDA

Cons:
como eu disse la em cima...o port... como eu posso explicar? o jogo sofre constantemente com crashes e freezings durante a gameplay, a otimizaçao do jogo tbm nao foi trabalhada direito isso sem contar os graficos...que se comparar com a versao de xbox 360...mds...uma lavada linda de balde d'agua mesmo se voce tiver jogando no maximo e olha que esse jogo nem pesado é da pra rodar ele de boas em qualquer pc.
o sistema de combate so por deus, de tanto inimigo que aparece voce fica sem folego pra fazer alguma coisa com arma branca, so arma de fogo e olha que o personagem usando arma de fogo é mais travado que estatua de madeira.
os sons do jogo sao TERRIVEIS diferente da soundtrack que é maravilhosa os sons sao tao desastrosos quanto o cancelamento de Silent Hills, a faca nem barulho faz direito quando voce acerta ela em um inimigo.
os inimigos do jogo dao uma dor de cabeça tbm pq tem alguns que nao param de defender e alguns que sao bem resistentes mas eu acho que eu to sendo frescurento pq os inimigos do downpour conseguem ser piores doq os do homecoming

Consideraçoes finais: se voce realmente nao quer passar perrengue no jogo recomendo voce instalar um patch que corrige os crash e os freezings do jogo, agradeçam aos fans por isso. eu so comprei esse sh pq ele é um dos meus favoritos.
se voce for fan de sh mesmo sinta-se a vontade e como eu ja disse instale o patch pra nao passar dor de cabeça.
agora se voce nao é tao fan assim cara passa direto. tu nao vai gostar desse jogo, bom se voce gostar eu nao sei, porem acho isso dificil por causa do port se for mesmo querer jogar ele recomendo jogar a versao do xbox 360 que é menos problematica

After having bought a Steamdeck five years later, I was actually able to play this, so I can comment on the game itself. I'll try to sum things up with a few bullet points.

GOOD:

+ Great visuals that hold up really well for a console game from 2008. Enemy visual design is superb, especially the bosses.

+ Audio across the board is top-notch (voice acting, sound effects, music). The soundtrack of prior games returns with some new songs added with a few of them having vocals from Mary Elizabeth McGlynn. I think out of all of the games in the SIlent Hill franchise this one has the best soundtrack.

+ The plot has some inconsistencies but overall it's really good. It does not have the same depth that Silent Hill 1, 2 and 3 had, but it holds its own.

BAD:

- Terrible combat. True, prior Silent Hill franchise entries (and survival horror games in general) are known for this—for a lot of those other games the awkwardness manages to be more of a pro than a con, as it makes the player feel vulnerable, which enhances the fear factor. But something is just really off with this one. I'll do my best to elaborate...

Homecoming uses a stance system, where you manually activate a ""combat-mode"" with a button. Doing so with any melee weapon (what you'll be using most of the time) causes the camera to focus on an enemy. At this point combat sort of becomes like a beat-em-up/survival horror hybrid, where you can slowly circle-strafe around enemies, dodge attacks and perform combo chains. It sort of works when there is only one enemy on-screen, but the developers often like to throw two or three or more of them at you at the same time. Functionally the closest game I've played to this is Callisto Protocol (albeit Homecoming has a dedicated dodge button, while Callisto Protocol does not).

Dodging feels really clunky—hitboxes are not precise and enemies will sometimes land their attacks even if it looked like they should have missed. Larger enemies flail around, knocking you down repeatedly. On Normal difficulty it doesn't end up being all that challenging because health items are actually fairly plentiful. So if you're lazy you can just half-ass your way through combat and keep healing yourself up whenever you get too low.

On the topic of difficulty, enemies have way too much health, rendering them giant damage sponges, even on Normal. Sometimes you can just run past them but this isn't always an option—it seems the developers really wanted Homecoming to be more action oriented than other Silent Hill games.

- Human enemies. Near the end of the game, you fight [spoiler]cultists in hazard suits[/spoiler]. There aren't many of them, but they seem a bit out of place.

- Unpolished port. On my Steamdeck I was not able to take full advantage of the entire 16:10 screen resolution (1280x800) and instead had to settle for 16:9 (1280x720), resulting in black bars at the top and bottom of the screen. And while the game can set at 60 or 90 FPS in the main menu it is functionally it is locked to 30 FPS regardless of what you set. There are other issues I could mention, like the game locking up for a second when transitioning to certain areas.

VERDICT: Worth playing if you're a diehard Silent Hill fan and have a system that can actually run it, such as a Steamdeck. Otherwise, skip it.

It took me about 13 hours to beat—that is with some unnecessary backtracking, dying a few times, and getting stuck on a puzzle once. Playing through it efficiently (but not rushing) I would expect it to take around 10+ hours to beat. There are two difficulty settings (Normal and Hard) and multiple endings with corresponding outfit unlocks, lending the game some replayability.


ORIGINAL REVIEW:

This port is a total mess:

*It's locked at 30 fps (fixable with a fan-made patch).

*While it can run at high resolutions—I tested up to 4k—without any patches, selecting resolutions above 720p clips off sections of the in-game map (fixable with a fan-made patch up to 1080p at least).

*Controller icons default to generic 1-2-3-4 buttons (can swap these to PS or XBox buttons with a fan-made patch).

*If you are running the game on very modern hardware (I think more recent multi-core processors cause this but I'm not entirely sure) your character will just freeze when a cutscene is supposed to trigger. This happens to me very early on after putting in a passcode to open a door. This is not fixable with a fan-made patch. I tried wiping the game from my hard drive and all config changes that had been made by the patches and doing a complete re-install, but even then, this problem still occurs. At least I only wasted $5 instead of the normal asking price of 40!","UPDATED REVIEW:

After having bought a Steamdeck five years later, I was actually able to play this, so I can comment on the game itself. I'll try to sum things up with a few bullet points.

GOOD:

+ Great visuals that hold up really well for a console game from 2008. Enemy visual design is superb, especially the bosses.

+ Audio across the board is top-notch (voice acting, sound effects, music). The soundtrack of prior games returns with some new songs added with a few of them having vocals from Mary Elizabeth McGlynn. I think out of all of the games in the SIlent Hill franchise this one has the best soundtrack.

+ The plot has some inconsistencies but overall it's really good. It does not have the same depth that Silent Hill 1, 2 and 3 had, but it holds its own.

BAD:

- Terrible combat.

It's way simpler and safer than using weird executables from rando's on the internet.  You just put the WINE wrapper in the location of the executable, and you are off and running.

[*]crazy, unique, and bizarre enemy/boss types
[*]spoopy atmosphere, with a few good jump scares that got me pretty good[/list]

[h1]Neutral:[/h1]
[list][*]it's an older game, so expect dated graphics that not everyone will enjoy 
[*]poor lip sync, and sometimes lackluster voice performance
[*]no auto-saves, and you can only save at specific locations - at times they were spaced fine, but a few times a couple more locations would have been nice to prevent backtracking[/list]

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list][*]constantly crashes when alt-tabbing and also during loading, not to mention the very long load times (even running on an M.2) - [i]after installing a fan-made patch, the crashes seemed to be much less frequent though[/i]
[*]constantly experiences game freezing when trying to save, load, or anytime a cutscene is about to start playing,  as well as some other random frame drops here and there (Win10, GTX 1070 TI, i7-6700k, 32GB RAM)
[*]the audio is sometimes broken, and you can only hear it in mono instead of stereo; on top of that the soundtrack just feels very awkward and out of place during many of the dialog scenes
[*]combat feels incredibly sluggish and clunky, and it can be extremely frustrating on some of the encounters; this frustration can be even further amplified due to the VERY limited health and ammo in some areas[/list]

Seriously, whatever you do, do not play this on PC. The PC port is absolutely terrible. I am almost positive that I would have enjoyed it FAR more had I played on console.

[list][*]it's an older game, so expect dated graphics that not everyone will enjoy 
[*]poor lip sync, and sometimes lackluster voice performance
[*]no auto-saves, and you can only save at specific locations - at times they were spaced fine, but a few times a couple more locations would have been nice to prevent backtracking[/list]

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list][*]constantly crashes when alt-tabbing and also during loading, not to mention the very long load times (even running on an M.2) - [i]after installing a fan-made patch, the crashes seemed to be much less frequent though[/i]
[*]constantly experiences game freezing when trying to save, load, or anytime a cutscene is about to start playing,  as well as some other random frame drops here and there (Win10, GTX 1070 TI, i7-6700k, 32GB RAM)
[*]the audio is sometimes broken, and you can only hear it in mono instead of stereo; on top of that the soundtrack just feels very awkward and out of place during many of the dialog scenes
[*]combat feels incredibly sluggish and clunky, and it can be extremely frustrating on some of the encounters; this frustration can be even further amplified due to the VERY limited health and ammo in some areas[/list]

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
Seriously, whatever you do, do not play this on PC. The PC port is absolutely terrible. I am almost positive that I would have enjoyed it FAR more had I played on console. That being said, even without the sheer brokenness of the PC port, this game is bound to infuriate some people with the combat."

Silent Hill: Homecoming is a 3rd-person survival horror. After a long military campaign, Alex comes back to his hometown Sherperd's Glen. However, when he does come back, the whole town is covered in fog, almost everyone is missing and dark creatures roam the streets. As you try to figure out what's going on, you'll be solving puzzles, fighting monsters and finding items to help you along the way.

For a game that was made in 2008, it didn't look so bad. Facial animations did receive a nice polish. Monsters were well designed. The map layout and decoration weren't over-done. The Otherworld, which was based on the movie, looked nice and provided a nice light show with decent shadows. Since this game was made with the PS3 in mind, I'm not sure the PC version can really do justice to what the devs wanted. It might look smoother on a PS3. All in all, I had no major complaints about the graphics.

Long time composer since the serie's start, Akira Yamaoka makes a rather lukewarm comeback after Team Silent's disbandment. Sound effects and ambient songs do sounds nice, but feels pale compared to his previous works. On a technical level, the PC port is fixed to use 5.1 surround sound. If you don't have that option on your soundcard or don't own  5.1 headphone/speaker, you'll be forced to play with volume playing only in 1 ear for 95% of every sounds. And of course, there's no ingame option for that or any possible INI tweaks.

From here on, it gets worse. This version of Homecoming is an exemplified rushed PC port. It was a datadump in an attempt to recoup the losses of the PS3 version selling poorly and receiving low review scores. Once it was released it never received any update whatsoever, even if the forums seemed to be flooded with problems back then.

One problem in particular was an UI bug that prevented progress because you couldn't interact with a certain object in Alex's house. The only solution found by the community was to use a controller just for this one time and then switch back to KB/M. Even to this day, the issue is still present in the game.

The game will sometimes hang for many long seconds before resuming, even if nothing note-worthy seemed to be happening. This happened during combat, often just before enemies attacked. This also happened in cut-scenes...

There's keyboard and mouse support, but you've got those button-mashing QTE's on every corner. Then you switch to controller, but controller support is pre-historic-tier XInput support. There is no button icon in the game. i.e. Push ""BUTTON 1"" to activate. Push ""BUTTON 10"" to open menu, etc. Lastly, there's no camera sensitivity option for joystick input and it's set to very slow. So yeah, you pretty much have no choice but to use keyboard, but you still need a controller to pass that UI glitch mentioned above. oof.

After getting over all those problems, I finished the game. The game in general is a far cry from previous entries. There's not much exploring to do, there's not much variety of weapons and enemy encounters feel far in-between. The very first ending I got was the UFO ending... This type of ending is supposed to be seen after your first playthough yet it's the one I got. The game ended on a silly note before I could see the serious side of the story. Finishing the game In previous SH had a stats screen which showed what ending you got, how much time you took, how many enemies killed, etc. There's none of that in Homecoming.

So, let's sum all that up real quick.
- Not-so-bad graphics and sounds
- Stutter/hangups everywhere
- Botched 5.1 sound
- Poor controls
- Game breaking UI bug
- Short and linear, shallow gameplay
- Silly endings possible right from the start
- No stats screen at the end, very few unlockables.
- Was never patched
- Still being sold at a high price on Steam, even if other websites sell it for peanuts.

Steam did not do refunds back then, so I was stuck with it. There was no pre-order option, so I bought this on day-1 for 45$ usd like a giant mongoloid SH fanboy that I am. You'd think that a company like Konami with game franchises like Metal Gear and Castlevania would uphold a certain quality standard for their popular franchise, yet they clearly dropped the ball on this one.

This is what happens when you disband the original serie developpers and outsource the game's right to foreign devs. With limited time/budget and different view on the source material, the game feels rough and almost unfinished.  And this botched PC port just made things worse.

I cannot recommend this game due to it being an horrible PC port and a shallow SH experience. I rate this a solid 3/10, loose ##ERROR## out of 10.

Sou suspeito pra falar sobre esse jogo, pois SH pra mim é sinônimo de arrepios, sem dúvida é a série de games mais perturbadora que eu já joguei. Mas Homecoming deixou um pouco a desejar.

Peguei o jogo em promoção por 5 reais e por isso valeu bastante o pequeno investimento. O jogo é legal, mas não é a maravilha que se espera de SH. A começar pela péssima otimização. Mais horripilante que os seres que você enfrenta, são os congelamentos que o jogo te proporciona constantemente. Você tá andando e do nada o jogo CONGELA COMPLETAMENTE (no meu caso, por até 1 minuto), mas depois volta. Té dá aquele gelo e você pensa ""putz, vou ter que passar toda essa parte de novo"". Se isso acontecer, não se desespere, apenas tenha paciência e espere o jogo voltar ao normal. Acontecia comigo toda hora que eu ia salvar o jogo, mas também aconteceu muito em momento aleatórios.

Os gráficos de Homecoming são OK para a época, mas me pareceu que a dedicação nessa parte foi meio aleatória, tem horas que o seu personagem Alex parece muito bem feito, e outras horas ele fica zoadão, parecendo gráfico de PS2 (lembrando que esse jogo saiu na geração Xbox 360 e PS3).

O sistema de batalha do jogo é travado demais, tem horas que dá raiva lutar contra qualquer inimigo. Aliás, também achei que o design de monstros desse jogo ficou um pouco aquém. Alguns personagens icônicos fazem sua aparição como as enfermeiras e o Pyramid Head [spoiler](esse só dá o ar da graça mesmo, você nunca chega a lutar contra ele)[/spoiler].

Os puzzles do jogo são relativamente fáceis se você souber inglês. 

O sistema de inventário até que é bom, mas um pouco desajeitado, pois se você apenas aponta, por exemplo, para um ""serum"", que é um item que recupera sua energia totalmente, se você sair do menu de itens apontando esse item, ele é usado automaticamente. Aconteceu isso comigo várias vezes, quando eu nem queria usar o item, acabei desperdiçando vários. O item deveria ser usado somente após apertar algum outro botão confirmando. 

A sincronia das falas dos personagens e do próprio som em geral às vezes fica bem fora na hora das cutscenes, o que atrapalha um pouco a ambientação.  

A história não tem nada de muito original. O jogo tem 5 finais diferentes, que variam conforme algumas decisões que você toma no decorrer do jogo. As escolhas que eu tomei me deram o final pior de todos, na minha opinião.

Só falei mal do jogo, mas estou recomendando, porque afinal de contas ele possuiu todos os elementos que tornaram Silent Hill um sucesso. Ao finalizar o game e ficar vendo os créditos com o nome de toda a equipe que desenvolveu o jogo, fiquei pensativo, pois eles devem ter trabalhado muito pra lançar o jogo, mas ao mesmo tempo fico pensando que eles poderiam ter feito melhor.

Mas, novamente, paguei 5 reais, não posso reclamar muito.

-La optimización es horrible. 
-Hay bugs, y no pocos. Aunque ninguno de ellos me ha obligado a reiniciar la partida o me ha impedido continuar.

-Los fps son más o menos estables, aunque hay zonas en las que caen un poco.

Gostaria de fazer uma análise profunda da história do jogo, mas não consegui zerá-lo graças aos crashes, que vão se tornando cada vez mais comuns conforme avança.

Pyramid Head é uma representação da mente de James em Silent Hill 2 e só. É um personagem legal e tudo mais, mas não faz sentido a aparição dele nesse jogo.

After playing the game for a few hours I noticed some bugs (like walls that can’t be opened or monsters who won’t die), to fix the bug you got to close the game and restart it than you will get respawned at your last saving point. After a few times repeating the level did it got annoying. One of the other problems is that you must choose between audio or subtitles, do you choose subtitles than you won’t have any audio or sometimes you don’t have audio at all. The graphics are okay (shadows, details, etc.), but you can’t play it on big screen. Another detail that I missed was that whenever I cut one of the nurses with my knife, I did not saw any blood, but hey, that can be me. 

The game has a good storyline and the puzzles are not too difficult.

Edit: There are some fan made patches that make this game somewhat playable. I recommend the one that doubles the frame rate (since this game is hard capped at 30 and still drops frames sometimes), and the button overlay mod.

Even with the patches the game still sometimes crashes out of nowhere, resolutions higher than 1080p completely breaks the UI, also QTEs are sometimes broken... if you get pinned by an enemy that requires you to press a certain button to escape, you can just watch your health get drained until you die because QTEs never prompted.

The dodge mechanic is a bit bugged. Even if you time it perfectly sometimes you still get hit, other times you dodge perfectly fine. Moving and shooting is wacky... like you can't adjust your aim while moving and vice versa.

By the time I finished this game, 100% of my deaths came from broken QTE prompts that never showed up so I was just pinned by an enemy and unable to escape until my character's health got drained to 0.

Oh stun locks are also a thing, if you're not careful you can easily get stun locked by an enemy. Trying to dodge away will result in you just getting interrupted mid dodge over and over, I recommend the knife or pipe if you're getting cornered against a wall and getting stun locked.

One last thing, the save file does not get backed up on steam cloud so if you happen to uninstall this game, then reinstall it you have to start all over again so if anything back up your game's save before uninstalling it.

Also for some reason this game is still 40$ and it came out in 2008... and it's a broken buggy mess. So avoid it completely unless it's like 90% off. Otherwise it's not worth your money or time because trust me you're gonna want to pull your hair out while playing this. You've been warned.

Daha sonrasında efsane bestekar Akira Yamaoka'nın son kez bulunduğu bu yapım bizleri bekliyordu. Oyun, hikaye ve anlatım olarak efsane iken, kontroller, canavarların önceki oyunlara göre kötü oluşu, bir eksiklik bulundurması ile de kötüydü.

Oyun, Alex Shepherd adlı karakterimizin askeri üniformasıyla hastaneye ne olduğu belirsiz adamın getirmesi, Pyramid Head'in görünüşüyle başlıyor. Daha sonrasında eve geldiğimizde tüm kasabanın adeta yok olduğunu, neredeyse birkaç kişinin kaldığını, annemize büyük hüzün bastığını görüyoruz. Daha öncesinde hastanede gördüğümüz kardeşimiz Joshua'nın kayıp, babamızın da onu bulmaya gittiğini öğrendikten sonra biz de kardeşimizi bulma yoluna çıkıyoruz. Bu yolda genel olarak Babamız çok büyük günahkar olarak gözükecek ve neredeyse intikam nefreti duyacağız.

Medium is the message. Yani basit olan iyidir mantığıyla yazılıyor tüm Silent Hill oyunları. İlk oyunda bir araba kazasıyla kızımız kayboluyorken, ikinci oyunda 3 yıl önce ölmüş eşimizden mektup aldıktan sonra onu arıyoruz. Bunda ise kardeşimiz ve babamız kayıp. Her oyun Silent Hill kasabasında geçen iken ilk defa 4 (ki aslında Silent Hill olarak tasarlanmadı) tamamıyla farklı bir yerde geçmişti. Bu oyun ise kendi kasabamızda ve Silent Hill'de geçiyor ve aynı duyguları, korkuyu, gerilimi vermeyi de ihmal etmiyor. Origins'te ve Downpour'da çiğnenen Otherworld ve Silent Hill kuralları bu oyunda çiğnenmiyor olması da bir artı veriyor.

Tam bir Silent Hill oyunu olmasından bahsetmişken şöyle ufak bir spoiler verelim, gidişat ve final Silent Hill 2 ile aynı. Yani bildiğimiz Scripti sadece değiştirmişler diyelim. Nasıl ki Star Wars 7 ve 8, 4 ve 5'in neredeyse aynısıysa bu da aynen öyle. Bu, kötü bir şey değil hatta tam tersine bu oyun özelinde konuşursak efsane bir şey. Finali o kadar vurucu ki hem boğazınızda armut kalmışçasına üzülüyor, hem noluyor deyip olaylara anlam veremiyor oyunu bitirdikten sonra da niye böyle oldu diye düşünüp duruyorsunuz. İşte bu gerçek Silent Hill. Oyunu oynayın ve bu finali yaşayın derim.

Hem Steam'de hem başka platformlarda yaklaşık 300 kadar oyun bitirdim. Silent Hill'in havası her zaman farklı olmuştur. Steam açısından diğer SH oyunlarının bulunmaması büyük hata. Bu oyun ise PC'de gerçekten çok sorunlu. Laglı olması, kontrollerin aşırı kötü olması ve köstek olması, 30 FPS kilidinin olması vesaire vesaire. Bunlar oyun zevkinizi fazlasıyla bozacak özellikler. Ancak bunları bir yana bıraktığınızda ve hikayeye kitlendiğinizde (ki kitletiyor) fazlasıyla gizemli ve sürükleyici bir durumun içine kayboluyorsunuz.

Bundan sonrası SPOILERLIDIR.
[spoiler] Ailemizden izlere rastlıyoruz. Mesela babamızın silahı tamir edilemiyor, kardeşimizin ""Beni affet"" yazısıyla saatini bulunca aniden Silent Hill'e çıkıyoruz. Her şey birer birer geliyor ve sizi fazlasıyla merak ettiriyor. En son annemiz de babamızın yerini işaretlediğinde artık babamızdan intikam alabileceğimizi düşünüyoruz. Abinle oynama, o kendi arkadaşlarıyla oynasın deyip kardeşimizden bizleri uzaklaştıran ve belki de kardeşimizin ölümüne sebep olan babamızdan intikam alacağımız için mutluyduk ta ki finale kadar değil mi? Bu oyunu sevenler bu yapıyı sevenler Oldboy ve The Return filmlerine mutlaka ama mutlaka baksın. Finalde aslında kardeşimizi kendimiz öldürdüğümüzü, bir asker olmadığımızı, kardeşimizi öldürdükten (kaza ile de olsa) iyice delirip kafayı sıyırdığımızı, uyandığımızda da bir asker olduğumuzu sandığımızı anlıyoruz. Ve evet çok ürpertici değil mi?	[/spoiler]

While it comes close, with the first game releasing on PSX in 1999, Alone in the Dark (1992) and Resident Evil (1996) had it beaten by several years. That doesn't make Silent Hill any less of an outstanding, classic series of the beloved sub-genre, but it is a franchise that has had severe ups and downs over the last 20 years. Sadly, the once cult classic has seen more of the bad times in recent years, though 2008's Silent Hill Homecoming is truly the last decent entry.

I would love to go in to talking about the story, and how Homecoming ties in to most of the other Silent Hill games (including Origins), but to be quite blunt, I'd rather not waste your time. This is a horrendous PC port. For the first 30-40 minutes that I was playing this title, I thought the reviews were, once again, greatly exaggerated; regrettably, this is not the case. After only 50 minutes of play time, I found that I was completely stuck due to the game-breaking bookshelf bug, and I was forced to restart from my last save point... which was roughly a half-hour earlier. After scouring the forums it seems that a lot of people get stuck in bookshelf-puzzle hell, as it's quite a common problem that Konami never bothered to fix.

The game-breaking puzzle bugs are the least of this PC port's concerns, though. The audio is just abysmal, and it's almost as if the dialogue, footsteps, and sound effects were all recorded in mono; they'll only come through one speaker. The beautiful, classic-styled soundtrack is fortunate enough to play in stereo, but it completely overwhelms the narrative. The controls are another downside here, and while you can use a controller or the keyboard + mouse, the remapping likes to take a dump back to the default map every now and then. For KB + M controls, multiple interactions are mapped to the same key in some instance, which is insane.

Amazingly enough, the graphics hold up extremely well for a game that's a decade old this year. For some reason, no matter what you do or what refresh rate you set the game at, it will cap at 30 FPS. Now, typically I am a FPS nazi, and I demand good optimization of all titles that I play. That being said, the game does run smoothly at 30 FPS, and it doesn't seem that bad. There are a few guides on how to work around this setting, but in the long run it's not that big of a deal. In fact, this is the least problematic aspect of this release.

Having played Silent Hill Homecoming on Xbox 360 back when it released, I can say with confidence that it's a decent title; just not this abhorrent PC port. Konami don't even care enough about this port to adjust the pricing, $43.99 CAD is utterly mad for a game that's a decade old, and has been on Steam since its release. If you have a console, be it Playstation 3 or Xbox 360, try to hunt this game down at your local used shop, I'm sure you can grab it for $15 or less. Silent Hill Homecoming is worth at least a playthrough for fans of the series, but be warned that it's definitely not the greatest entry.

The Horror Network [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28221963/]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore","Quite often, people mistake Silent Hill as ""the first"" survival horror game. While it comes close, with the first game releasing on PSX in 1999, Alone in the Dark (1992) and Resident Evil (1996) had it beaten by several years. That doesn't make Silent Hill any less of an outstanding, classic series of the beloved sub-genre, but it is a franchise that has had severe ups and downs over the last 20 years. Sadly, the once cult classic has seen more of the bad times in recent years, though 2008's Silent Hill Homecoming is truly the last decent entry.

I would love to go in to talking about the story, and how Homecoming ties in to most of the other Silent Hill games (including Origins), but to be quite blunt, I'd rather not waste your time. This is a horrendous PC port. For the first 30-40 minutes that I was playing this title, I thought the reviews were, once again, greatly exaggerated; regrettably, this is not the case. After only 50 minutes of play time, I found that I was completely stuck due to the game-breaking bookshelf bug, and I was forced to restart from my last save point... which was roughly a half-hour earlier. After scouring the forums it seems that a lot of people get stuck in bookshelf-puzzle hell, as it's quite a common problem that Konami never bothered to fix.

The game-breaking puzzle bugs are the least of this PC port's concerns, though. The audio is just abysmal, and it's almost as if the dialogue, footsteps, and sound effects were all recorded in mono; they'll only come through one speaker. The beautiful, classic-styled soundtrack is fortunate enough to play in stereo, but it completely overwhelms the narrative. The controls are another downside here, and while you can use a controller or the keyboard + mouse, the remapping likes to take a dump back to the default map every now and then. For KB + M controls, multiple interactions are mapped to the same key in some instance, which is insane.

Amazingly enough, the graphics hold up extremely well for a game that's a decade old this year. For some reason, no matter what you do or what refresh rate you set the game at, it will cap at 30 FPS. Now, typically I am a FPS nazi, and I demand good optimization of all titles that I play. That being said, the game does run smoothly at 30 FPS, and it doesn't seem that bad. There are a few guides on how to work around this setting, but in the long run it's not that big of a deal. In fact, this is the least problematic aspect of this release.

Silent Hill Homecoming, como juego de terror es genial, ya que además de sentirte angustiado y en tensión a cada momento por la excelente atmósfera; también te sientes angustiado y en tensión en la vida real, ya que en cualquier momento te puede saltar un crasheo random, sobre todo en las pantallas de carga, para las que te recomiendo un rosario y todas las oraciones que te sepas... Es así, ¡la maldad de Silent Hill traspasa límites!

Ahora en serio, habrás leído muchos análisis negativos por allí donde se critica lo mal porteado que está este juego; y déjame decirte que no es así de malo: Es mucho mucho peor... ya que además de enfrentar estos 'sudden crashes' en esta versión de PC, lidiarás con defectos de port tales como que está capado a 30 FPS, tendrás que jugarlo a 720p si es que quieres ver completo el mapa, tendrás que aplicar un parche para ver los botones correctos si es que juegas con mando (algo que recomiendo encarecidamente), y tendrás que salvar OBLIGATORIAMENTE en cada punto de guardado que te encuentres, ya que el juego además que se te puede cerrar en cualquier momento, cuenta con bugs de diseño que te rompen la partida, y te pueden obligar a reiniciar todo si es que no tuviste la precaución de guardar en distintos slots. Estos bugs se encuentran también en las versiones de consola, y lo peor es que el juego está abandonado por parte de Konami hace mucho y no existen ni existirán parches que lo arreglen. Para sobrellevarlos, recomiendo revisar la guía de ""Berserker"" que se puede encontrar en los sitios de FAQs más populares, donde se enumeran detalladamente y se dan tips para evitarlos.

Ahora bien, los cierres inesperados no son tan frecuentes como lo pintan otros análisis, te darás cuenta que si te topas con uno de ellos (y créeme que lo harás, es inevitable), notarás que será muy improbable que te topes con otro en la misma sesión, o en las siguientes horas. Y si te armas de una santa paciencia, puedes manejar estas frustraciones de la mejor manera: Por ejemplo, si te topas con un cierre inesperado, y tu partida guardada más reciente está como media hora atrás, haz lo siguiente: Luego de mandar al carajo a los desarrolladores y a toda su familia, reinicias el juego, cargas la partida y recorres nuevamente el largo camino, pero esta vez, al haber ya aprendido la ruta a seguir, los patrones de los enemigos que te aparecerán y la forma de afrontar cada desafío de la mejor manera, al llegar al punto donde se te crasheó el juego, notarás... ¡oh sorpresa! que lo hiciste en el menor tiempo posible y optimizando al máximo los recursos de los que dispusiste hasta ese momento.

¡Ojo! Con estos consejos no estoy justificando la decepcionante optimización del juego, pero estoy tratando de salvarlo de la quema por una simple y llana razón: La historia y ambientación es una maravilla.

Si con todo lo dicho hasta aquí, estás dispuesto a empezarlo (cosa que me alegra sobremanera), verás que te encontrarás con un juego sobrecogedor; con un control mejorado con respecto a los juegos anteriores de la saga, a pesar de que las animaciones en los combates se vean torpes; con personajes bien escritos y con una historia magnífica, secuela directa de la saga principal y de las mejores de la misma. No por nada el protagonista comparte similitudes con el de SH2, el considerado mejor juego de toda la saga, y hasta 'Cabeza Piramidal' hace un par de cameos estelares, esto en parte porque  al momento de su salida se había estrenado en cines la primera película de la saga, donde dicho enemigo también hacía su aparición, y por esto mismo es que algunos aspectos audiovisuales se tomaron de la misma, tales como el sonido de la sirena y el efecto de degradación en cada transformación del mundo real al otro mundo, o el diseño del cartel de ingreso a las dos ciudades que visitamos en el transcurso del juego.

Para terminar, a pesar de todo lo mal optimizado que está, del muy mal port que es, de la casi obligatoriedad de tener que usar una guía para evitar glitches, recomiendo este juego por la maravillosa historia y ambientación. Eso sí, ni de cojones a precio completo, ya que se suele ofertar muy a menudo en todas las campañas que acostumbra Steam, y a muy bajo precio. (Yo lo obtuve a aprox US$ 3.00).

Halihazırdaki bilgisayarım (Artık eski bilgisayarım: GT 320M ekran kartı, 4 GB RAM ve Core 2 Duo 2.4 GHz işlemcisi vardı) bu oyunu en düşük ayarlarda ve hiç değilse 640*480 çözünürlükte ve 30 kare hızında sabitlenmiş halde oynatmalıyken cidden acayip zorlanıyor bazı yerlerde. Oyunu PS3'te de oynamış olduğum için de bu belli oluyor benim açımdan, bu yüzden PC'de pek akıl kârı olmasa da fiyatı gerçekten ucuzdu aldığımda, ayrıca orijinal bir Silent Hill oyununun koleksiyonumda bulunmasını da isterdim, keşke Silent Hill 2-3-4'ü de ekleme olasılığımız olsaydı (Dördüncü oyun GOG.com'da 2020'den beri satın alınabilir durumda bu arada. Zaten geçtiğimiz aylarda ikinci oyunun remake'i de çıktı ve Silent Hill f de yolda). 


[h1]Hangi platformlarda oynanabilir?[/h1] 
Her neyse, oynayacaksanız eğer, ilk başta PS3 ve XBOX 360'a çıktı bu oyun, birincil tercihiniz bunlardan birinde oynamak olsun veya bunlar yoksa emülatör kullanabilirsiniz belki. Ama sadece bitirmek adına Youtube'dan walkthrough videoları da izleyebilirsiniz. 

Mutlaka kendim oynayarak tecrübe edeceğim PC versiyonunu diyorsanız da sisteminizin iyi olmasında (Optimizasyon sıkıntısını hissetmemek açısından) fayda var. Ayrıca PCGamingWiki sitesinde bu oyun için açılmış sayfaya girip Unknownproject'in yamasını indirip kurarak oyunu biraz daha oynanabilir hale getirebilirsiniz. Bir başka önerim de, oyunu tam ekranda oynamamanız çünkü tam ekranda Alt+Tab yapma lüksünüz yok, oyun direkt olarak çalışmayı durdurur (Sonradan Unknownproject tarafından çözüldü diye biliyorum). Optimizasyon problemi açısından döneminin diğer oyunları ile de ortak yanları var, anlayamadım gerçekten. Bana mı öyle geliyor, yoksa 2008-2010 döneminde nevri mi dönmüş oyun yapımcılarının PC'ye port etme esnasında? Gerçi olabilir böyle hatalar ama Konami'nin veya Double Helix'in herhangi bir düzeltme uygulamadan oyunu Steam'e koyuvermesi kabul edilmemeli bana kalırsa.


[h1]Silent Hill: Homecoming'e Dair[/h1] 
Hikaye, atmosfer, oynanış ve mekanikler açısından konuşacak olursam, Silent Hill serisinde şu 5 oyunun üzerine tanımam zor: Silent Hill 1, 2, 3, 4 ve Silent Hill Origins (Shattered Memories'e dair fikirlerim değişti, artık pek de iyi değil o oyun benim için. Hatta PC port'unu saymazsak Homecoming dahi daha öne geçti benim gözümde, en azından iyi bir deneme olarak). Hikayeden tut da, mekaniklere, silahlara, hele ki şarkılara (Akira Yamaoka ve Mary Elizabeth McGlynn demem yeterlidir sanırım) kadar... Tecrübe edilmeli ya, anlatmak, bilemiyorum... Tabi konumuz Silent Hill: Homecoming olduğu için ondan bahsedeceğim altta;

Karakterimiz Alex Shepherd, bir askerdir ve bundan dolayı oyunda yakın dövüş, ataklardan kaçma ve karşı atak gerçekleştirme üzerine kurulu bir sistem var, ateşsiz silahlarda diğer Silent Hill karakterlerine göre öndesiniz (Ateşsiz silahların çeşitliliği konusunda değil tabi). Senaryo ise şöyle başlıyor: İlk başta patlamalar ve sirenler duyuyorsunuz ve değişik bir mekanda birinci görüşte etrafı izliyorsunuz. Sedyenizi süren adamın tekinsiz suratını ve kanlı giysilerini görünce birden korkuyorsunuz ve orada başka kişiler üzerinde gerçekleştirilen psikopatça eylemler, bu korkunuzu artırıyor. En sonunda bir odaya bırakılıyorsunuz ve ellerinizi bağladıkları kemerleri zorlaya zorlaya kopararak kurtuluyorsunuz ve bir süre etrafı araştırıp, bir çocuğun peşine düşüyorsunuz. Hikaye böyle böyle devam ediyor. 

Grafiklere gelince, oyunun optimizasyon sıkıntısı bir yana, özellikle 1. ile 3. oyundan gördüğümüz Otherworld atmosferini yansıtması açısından resmen yiğidi öldür hakkını yeme durumu. Silent Hill Homecoming'de en çok hoşuma giden durumlardan biri buydu. Yani şu yazdıklarımı bir düşündüm de, aslında bu oyunu ne tavsiye ederim, ne de tavsiye etmem, kararsızım yani. Birkaç paragraftır yazdıklarıma bakın, istiyorsanız alın. Eğer alırsanız hemen PCGamingWiki'de bu oyun için açılmış sayfaya girin ve Unknownproject'in yaptığı düzeltmeyi bulun, indirin ve kurun, öteki türlü canınız gerçekten sıkılacaktır bu port'un rezalet oluşundan ötürü.


[h1]Son Sözler[/h1] 
Toparlayacak olursam; grafikler, detaylar, müzikler güzel; hikaye ortanın biraz üstü; farklı farklı sonlar var, bu sonlar size farklı farklı şeyler kazandırabiliyor. Aynı zamanda optimizasyonu kötü, sağlam bir düzeltme yaması kurmanız gerekmekte. İndirimde değilken de alabilirsiniz ama tavsiye etmem, büyük indirimlerde 4.65 liraya düşüyordu fiyatı galiba, kapın gitsin (Artık maalesef bunu yapamıyoruz dolara geçişten dolayı malum, oyun maksimum 3 dolara düşüyor indirimlerde), iyi de bilgisayarınız varsa düzeltmeyle beraber FPS değerini sabitleyerek veya sabitlemeyerek oynayın işte. Bir de, aynı benim gibi serinin delisiyseniz oynayabilirsiniz ama ilk dört oyun kadar sarmayabilir sizi.

To this day it still is a bit freaky. 

Story: Good with a nice twist 

Graphically: Doesn't hold up, but the environment and enemies look good. It is mostly the cut scenes that look bad.

Combat: This is where the game fails big time. They had the right idea, but combat becomes really frustrating especially towards the end. Mouse 1 does light attacks, and mouse 2 does heavy attacks, which you can combo together, that part is really nice. It's the fact that you have a separate button to go into attack mode. You can imagine why this gets frustrating. There is a dodge button that doesn't seem to work half the time. I do like the fact that most of the time you only face one enemy at a time. 

Time to beat: 8-9 hours with mutiple endings (5 endings determined by three choices during the game) 

Final thought: 

If you are a fan of the Silent hill series, give this one a try. Like I said before it is a solid title that doesn't get enough credit. Ignore the haters!!!!

Éste y el primer Silent Hill son mis preferidos. Este juego tiene algo que te hace quererlo.

- JUGABILIDAD: Silent Hill 5 es un survival horror de verdad, no lo pasas bien porque la munición escasea mucho y la jugabilidad la tienes que enfocar en una buena combinación de esquivar y atacar con armas blancas. El sistema de combate me parece de lo mejor porque es jodido y te van a quitar vida muchas veces, lo que va a hacer que gestiones al límite tus botiquines de vida. Por otra parte hay checkpoints si te matan, pero tienes que guardar tú manualmente en puntos de guardado para continuar la partida, a lo vieja escuela. También tendremos algún que otro puzzle, pero salvo un par de momentos que quizas tengais que darle al coco más de la cuenta, son bastante sencillos.

- EXPLORACIÓN : Parte buena y parte mala. En Silent Hill 5 estaremos en exteriores e interiores, los exteriores serán segmentos de calles de Silent Hill, con zonas que explorar como parques, puertos, parkings, etc, mientras que en interiores seran normalmente lugares grandes (ayuntamiento, hotel, comisaria, etc) y algunas casas. El PUNTAZO de Konami es, como vienen haciendo desde el primer Silent Hill, que tendremos mapa para ir explorando, y conforme lo vayamos haciendo, el protagonista irá marcando con rotulador rojo las calles cortadas, sitios clave, puertas cerradas o abiertas, puntos de guardado, y demás indicaciones que hacen que no revisitemos sitios que ya hemos explorado, y que en resumen mejoran muchisimo la amenización del juego. La parte negativa es que hay mucho escenario vacío, lo cual acusa el hecho de que no hay tanto enemigo en el juego como hubiese gustado, pero realmente no entorpece el juego.

- AMBIENTACIÓN: Otro puntazo de Konami; poco que reprochar aquí. La sensación de agobio es constante, musica de piano deprimente, lugares absolutamente dantescos y grotescos, sustos, niebla, oscuridad, etc. Todo esto consigue que no juegues nunca cómodo que es exactamente de lo que trata Silent Hill.

- GRÁFICOS: Se defienden muy bien para ser de 2008, buenos efectos de luz, expresiones faciales, texturas y modelados.

- PORT: He aquí la cagada del juego. Si este juego tuviera un buen port seria indispensable, pero es probable que experimentes problemas a la hora de ejecutarlo. De primeras, puede crashearse en cualquier momento jodiendote el avance que llevaras, puedes tener problemas de mando si usas uno genérico, aunque el juego tiene mapeado de botones interno por lo que al final saldrás del paso. Por otra parte a veces pega unos tirones grandes que significan que el juego esta cargando un escenario, y ademas esta capado a 30 frames (por que sí), pero realmente puede disfrutarse igual.


Unos consejos rápidos para los que querais optimizarlo:

- Configurarlo para que se ejecute siempre como administrador y desmarcando la casilla de ""compatibilidad para...""

- No minimizeis el juego o se os crasheara lo más seguro, además creo que si teneis doble monitor, el juego no llega a iniciarse, por lo que tendreis que mostrar escritorio solo en uno.

- Si podeis usar un mando de xbox one o 360, mejor que mejor.

- En el archivo de configuración de los parámetros del juego, quizás tengais que indicar la resolucion de vuestro monitor cambiando la que venga en el archivo para que se inicie el juego.

- Por último, auque Steam diga que no esta en español, SI LO ESTA. Tiene subtitulos en español así que 0 problema.



En rebajas suelen poner el juego a 5€, ahí es el momento de comprarlo. No os asusteis por el port ya que al final no da tantos problemas como puedas imaginarte. Recomendación especial que lo juegues en dificil. Es un autentico juegazo y un homenaje a los survival horrors.

Espero que os sirva mi análisis.",

But for games like this one and the few other silent hill games that’s don’t fully get attached to the original story I tried to stay away from them. So, when my random to play game generater picked this game from my entire library I was quite sketchy of how good this one will be.

This one talks about an army man awoken from a nightmare after he that got discharged from the service. Got out of the hospital he went back to his home Shepard’s Glen which is a neighboring town of Silent Hill. You can see the place already covered in fog in a state of a “fog world” just like silent hill. People are disappearing and there is much dark history regarding the four family that created this town. With some trigger the fog world will be easier pulled deeper under and became “other world” (hell dimension).

Story wise this game was written quite nicely with good plot twists here and there. Not that long for only about 8-10 hours of gameplay. Music and sound effect is decent and combat animation is awkward but not intolerable. All the enemy are quite hard to fight against and you are seeking a lot of pain and death if you decide to raise the difficulty at the beginning of the game. Take patience to learn how every type of enemy move pattern and dodge accordingly. 4 beautiful boss fights and each match one of the family that founded Shepard’s Glen. 

There are a few different ending you can get like regular silent hill game but I only have enough interest to go though the game once.(I got the hospital ending.)

Beside all the good things I said so far this game is filled with a lot of bugs and crashes. If you are wanting to try playing this game you will need to read those niffy steam guide and do some straight fixing before you can run this game properly. Save whenever you see a save symbol will save you a lot of time in the long run. There is sound looping glitch that will force you to turn off the sound from time to time if you want to keep your eardrum intact. 

Control is horrible for this game as the 3D third person view and button setting feels super unnatural and awkward. The game itself is already very hard with the enemy thrown at you. Even the weakest balloon head nurse can pack a punch if you are not careful. With the weird control system and camera, you are given make progression an absolute nightmare on its own. (get a controller helps, avoid keyboard and mouse. Don’t be like me…)

6/10 Overall, it’s still a decent game with some good fright and nice story. No where close to as good as the first and third silent hill game but still packs quite a good deal of enjoyment. Too bad you just must go though all the bugs and bad controls to enjoy them.","There is no place like silent hill.

As a person who started liking Silent Hill series as a teenager starting from SH1 (and who did sleep like 3 hours because of bad and weird dreams on a school night which were caused by playing Silent Hill 1 for the first time in my life back in the day using my old PlayStation 1 console) to SH2 which I played with my brother because he was too scared to play the game just by himself. 

I have own and played them all (favorite being SH4 The Room) Silent Hill: Homecoming certainly feels like a Silent Hill game, it has same elements which defines the SH series; the mist of course, the jammed (and locked) doors all around, the broken streets (I never really found out what caused that, maybe I should research the series more), gorgeous and often eerie but mostly calming music.

In my opinion Homecoming works well as a pc version, so far I haven't found out anything negative yet (except with the minor issue of navigating map because I need to use zoom to show where I am currently). The game has elements from the earlier episodes from the series such as SH1, 2 and 3 to name a few. Story is pretty similar to Silent Hill 1 because the main character searches a lost family member. The story is really good and the voice actors are talented and the game plays well. The nice rustic graphics work well and give the town an eerie and little creepy feeling. In the darkness nobody hears your scream. 

Enemies are smart and there is a plenty of variety ranging from classic dog to more dangerous monsters. Silent Hill: Homecoming is not scary in my opinion but it is very atmospheric and often creepy game but fun to play.

I wouldn't pay 20€ for it but if its on sale for a 5€ (or even lower) be certain to grab this game of a piece of one of the most loved game series in history.

GRAFICOS:los graficos pos digamos que estan bien no tengo mucho que decir aqui

OPTIMIZACION: la razon por la cual no me pude pasar el juego fue su mala optmizacion y sus constantes crasheos el juego siempre estaba entre unos 20 - 30 fps y a veces se quedaba pegado el juego como 1 minutos de repente y lo que mas me irritaba era que estaba bastante avanzado en un nivel y de repente de la nada crasheaba el juego y pues cuando volvia a cargar la partida tenia que hacer desde el principio todo y no crasheaba de vez en cuando era practicamente cad 10 minutos me hubiese gustado acabar el juego pero es que asi no se puede

JUGABILIDAD:la jugabilidad nno me a gustado mucho combate algo lento movimiento algo raro la verdad pudieron haber mejorado mas la jugabilidad

BUGS: en cuanto a bugs me encontre BASTANTES que me da flojera decirlos xd

Разрабы больше всего  вдохновлялись экранизацией самой игры, причем это одна из лучших и удачных. Согласитесь, пирамидыч в фильме не плох. Да, да, почему бы и не  воспользоваться, чтобы привлечь другую часть аудиторию.

Silent Hill  всегда славился прекрасным саундтреком, атмосферой безнадежности, головоломками, стишками и секретами, большим количеством концовок, открываемых после многочисленных прохожденний, вдобавок для серии было особенно важно двусмысленность, чтобы имело различные интерпретации, теорий. Этот часть не исключение. 

Впервые в серии они решили перейди на объемный звук, конечно, это помогает атмосфере, но, в конечном итоге, вызвало множество проблем с портом. Добавили улучшенную боевую систему и удобное управление. Сюжет мудреный, дают выбр реплики, понять все детали с первого раза трудновато, хотя и выглядит с первого взгляда простым. Музыка одна из лучших качества игры, но они глубоко ошиблись с выбором заглавной темы саунда в меню.

Большой  недостаток заключается в том, что не чувствуешь героя, не чувствуешь, что город живой, все накрылось однотонным одеялом... Пусто... За их диалогами и действиями и не чувствуешь эмоций, чувств... отчасти это  претензии к звуку, из-за плохого порта, скудной лицевой анимации... 
После повторной, и прочитанных записей, все больше склоняюсь к помутнение рассудка у персонажа.

Что за политика у Конами, из-за чего запретили покупать Homecoming в других странах, у серии так много фанатов, а они вот так наплевали и плюют в лицо. 

Как большой фанат серии Silent Hill и как любитель жанра survival horror, от всего сообщество говорю- переиздайте классические части франшизы в Steam. Konami послушайте фанов уже, и сделайте следующий часть качественными, перестаньте ерундой заниматься. Не подведите нас, и будьте уверены - мы вас точно не подведем. それをやる.

Story and atmosphere is just like previous SH games, very well done...
Combat is rather cumbersome - sometimes very frustrating until you find out which weapons are effective against enemies. Some weapons are quick but weak, other are strong but slow.

Stay away from this god-awful game, it's a dysfunctional mess that's not even worth $1


This is absolute console port trash. The framerate is capped at 30fps, looks identical to a Nintendo64 game, and crashes every 5 minutes unless you spend 5 hours researching about how to get it to crash only every 30 minutes, and finally, the story is absolute dogshit. Don't even get me started on the bugs in this game, I could write an entire 100 page novel about all the glitches, bugs, and technological issues with this game. They actually expect someone to pay $40 for a game that's not even worth $5. This game is a disgrace to the Silent Hill legacy. You'd be better off buying Resident Evil 6. RE6 is garbage too, but at least you can laugh at it, and at least it actually functions. Playing Silent Hill Homecoming is just painful, you can't even mock it. The game will just mock you, as you spent $40 for it. I got this on sale for $5, and I still feel like I've been robbed. I only have about 15 minutes of play time on this, however, I have beaten the game twice on Xbox, and in just 15 minutes, and looking at the reviews, I can tell this is the worst version of the game that exists. This is a contender for worst PC port ever, or at least that I have seen. I understand that this post is rambling, but I don't care enough about the game to actually write out a coherent review. I urge you to stay away from this nightmare of a game. You will only waste your time on this, and you can't get a refund on that.

There is one good thing about this game. The music was done by Akira Yamaoka, so if you've played any Silent Hill game before Origins, then you know exactly what to expect.","TL;DR

Bu eleştirilerin bir kısmının gayet haklı konular iken diğer bir kısmı ise delinin teki kuyuya bir taş atmış hadi biz de atalım mantığı kokuyor. Tabii bunların hakkında daha fazla odur,budur,şudur diyerek bir kargaşa da ben yaratmayacağım. Onun yerine bir şans vermenizi rica ederek yavaşça oyunun konusuna geçeceğim.

Her oyununda olduğu gibi bu oyunun da kendine has bir girişe, o giriş kadar da enteresan bir karaktere sahip. Ben o karaktere 'Bay Evet Efendim' demeyi tercih etsem de kendilerinin asıl adı Alex Shepherd olmakta. Alex'i seride ilginç kılan ilk şey önceki serilerdeki karakterlerin hepsi sıradan insanlar iken onun asker olmasıdır. Lakin asker olmasına rağmen çokta sert ve otoriter bir kişiliği olduğunu söyleyemem. Tabii bu karakterin kendinden ziyade benim zorumla oluşturulmuş bir yanılgı da olabilir. Çünkü oyun içerisinde Alex'in seçimlerine doğrudan siz karar verebiliyorsunuz. Kısaca Bay Evet Efendimin affedici,umursamazlığı veya vicdansız biri olması sizin ellerinizde. Ben sanırım birazcık pamuk şeker kıvamında takılmış olabilirim.

Bolca patlama çatlama seslerinin ardından gözlerinizi açtığınız hastane size iyileşmekten ziyada öleceğiniz yermiş gibi gelebilir. Merak etmeyin ölmeden önce yapmanız gereken çok şey var. Mesela işe orada ne halt yediği bilinmez ama kardeşiniz Joshua'ın oyuncağını arayarak başlayabilirsiniz. Ararken de artık bir sembol haline gelmiş hemşirelerden kaçmayı sakın ama sakın unutmayın. Kısa bir uğrasın ardında bindiğiniz asansörde üzerinize doğru gelen kesici bir aletle zaten gördüğünüz kabustan uyanıyorsunuz. İşte tam o sırada karşımıza mübarek kamyonu ile bizi memleketimize taşıyan Travis abimiz çıkıyor. Bazılarınız bu ismi tanıdı öyle değil mi. Gerçi tanısanız da tanımasanız da ben oyunu anlatmayı burada kesmek zorundayım. Sonra alıp oynamak için bir nedeniniz kalmayacak.

Kalkıp size zaten herhangi bir Silent Hill yaratığından ya da bossundan bahsetmeme gerek yoktur herhalde. Ne de olsa her ne kadar üvey evlat diye giriş yapmış olsakta bu konuda laf edemeyiz. Gerek tasarımları gerek zorlukları gayet tatmin edici bence. Hele ki o bossların da hikayeye yedirilişine girecek olursak işin içinden ancak 'adamlar iyi düşünmüş usta' diyerek çıkarız. Birde tabii müzik konusu var ama hani iyi ya da kötü demek yerine tek bir isim versem yeterli olacaktır. -Akira Yamaoka-

It is true that this game doesn't connect the dots in the storyline properly... It is true that the developers just wanted to shove everything Silent hill 2 and 3 had into this one, making it feel less unique and symbolic.
However, it was still an entertaining game and it completely outclasses every other silent hill game in combat.

I don't care how many silent hill 2 soyboys come after me saying ""waaah silent hill homecoming's combat is awful, waaaaah""
Silent hill: Homecoming has the best combat compared to any other game in the franchise.
My reason to say this is simple:
Would you rather be stuck smacking a monster with a stick with the same lame animation for about 10 minutes until it dies?
Literally, Silent hill combat from 1 to 3, including Origins, shattered memories and others I forgor about. You can apply the ""Bonk"" meme... that's all there is to combat. a looped ""bonk"" until they die.

In silent hill homecoming while you get some overly exagerated combat movements, it gives you that chance of screwing up melee attacks. It keeps you focused on timing dodges or swings. Instead of, again, just standing still spamming m1 keeping the enemy stuck on a damage loop until it falls down.
The range weapons are also beautiful in this game, when you save enough ammo and a fight with multiple enemies arrives, it's just so pleasurable to shoot them down instead of having to risk being split in half from facing them.

What this game lacks in story, it makes up in action. It's true that silent hill is all about the story and I agree that this one is a bit wacky.
But people hate on it too much, even blindly in most cases. Just because the flock says silent hill 2 better, they barely even give this one a chance.

It's not the best, but it's not as bad as all the soyboys say it is.

Why am I giving it a thumbs down?
Because it's broken. This port is bad and everything glitches out or freezes. Unfortunately making this game unplayable in some cases. 

I love this game and I would play it all over again if they ever fixed it. 
I am not discouraging people from trying it out, it's still worth exploring it a bit.

Very hard to give this game a positive review just becuase of the number of technical issues you are likely to encounter. This game is the poster child of poor console port. From framerate drops to the random crashes and cumbersome controls. 

Also playing with M&K is quite frustrating owing to its console origins, with the need to 'lock' onto targets in combat mode before you can attack. If you do buy it I would recommend that you play with a controller as it a much easier experience.

However with that said the combat itself is pretty awful and quite repetative - and there is a lot of it. In fact you are often railroaded into large combat sections with multiple enemies. Survival horror the beat em up edition. This might not have been so bad if there were plenty of checkpoints to save at. Unfortunatley they are quite rare, and the game will randomly crash when loading a new area forcing you to repeat the entire section before you can save again. 

It is a shame because environment wise the game is pretty good and the visuals and voice acting are also well done. But no amount of glitz and atmosphere can make up for the endless tedious combat and random crashes, and certainly not at a nearly twenty pounds purchase price.","https://youtu.be/yuI82ik4kTY

It rivals Saints Row 2's port, though not quite as bad. I could overlook the game running at 30FPS if it actually kept a solid non-stuttery 30FPS. I could forgive the fact the game doesn't look as good as it could if there weren't glaring graphical glitches like objects having lines through them and random super bright bloom balls randomly floating around, rarely, but it does happen. I could forgive the lack of proper M+KB controls if getting an X360 controller to work wasn't such a janky process. (Have to start game with controller plugged in, go into options and select the option to use the XInput controller and then back all the way out, let it save and then restart the game to be able to use your 360 controller, guess I should be glad the option even exists.) The map and item inspection is broken on anything higher than 720p as well. I've also heard horror stories of the game randomly crashing, so far, out of 2 hours the worst that's happened to me is the bloom balls, lines in objects and stutter that makes it feel slower than 30FPS even though my framerate counter is showing 30FPS solid.

Despite all that, I still recommend it. Why? Well, it's a good game. I've played every Silent Hill game aside from Book of Memories and the arcade games since 2000 and I still like this game and while the story is weird and breaks the SH lore, it's a good stand alone SH title with some really creepy monster designs that are very welcome over Downpour's mediocre creature designs. The combat is also fun, I almost completed it on Xbox without getting hit, failed when it came to the cult members and their cheap tactics though. This port is PLAYABLE but I think the best experience would be if they added it as a backwards compat title to Xbox One. (Downpour is and Homecoming has a large number of voters but alas, no Homecoming on xbox one yet.) If not, the PC version I think is still more superior than the console versions as it DOES look better. (Graphical glitches aside.) And it does look pretty great to be fair, I wasn't expecting a huge difference but there's a clear upgrade in quality over the console versions. I have this on 360 as well and it was great on there but it looks even better on PC, I can make out many more details and textures look way better on PC with full texture filtering at 1080p. It really makes the game pop, the completely dynamic shadow system is great as well, it's really a wonderful looking game that could hold up today if it wasn't for some of the graphical glitches.

Double Helix tends to have a bad rep when it comes to PC ports. MX vs ATV Reflex, also ported by DH while not confirmed on Wikipedia but it is in the game credits is a completely broken mess for a lot of people. It's a shame too because the ground work is there, for both games, MvA: Reflex and Silent Hill: HC. They just need a LITTLE more polish and they'd both be great ports. But for whatever reason, THQ(THQ/Nordic)/Rainbow Studios are stupid and so is Konami (No surprise there.) and to be quite frank, so is Double Helix for leaving the games broken in the first place.

I WISH I could give this a ""meh"" review for the quality of the port mixed with this actually being a good game but a recommended will have to do. Hopefully this helps spark some interest in getting the game fixed and/or maybe getting some of the games re-released on Steam as there are PC ports of quite a few SH games including SH2, SH3, SH4:TR and this one. There was even a planned PC release for Shattered Memories but instead they decided to focus on the PS2 and the Wii for whatever strange reason. Though it's worth noting the Wii version can be played pretty easily on PC via Dolphin and a PC compatible/modded IR bar and standard BT dongle or one of the combo units sold by Mayflash.","The scariest thing about this game is the horrific quality of the port.

It rivals Saints Row 2's port, though not quite as bad. I could overlook the game running at 30FPS if it actually kept a solid non-stuttery 30FPS. I could forgive the fact the game doesn't look as good as it could if there weren't glaring graphical glitches like objects having lines through them and random super bright bloom balls randomly floating around, rarely, but it does happen. I could forgive the lack of proper M+KB controls if getting an X360 controller to work wasn't such a janky process. (Have to start game with controller plugged in, go into options and select the option to use the XInput controller and then back all the way out, let it save and then restart the game to be able to use your 360 controller, guess I should be glad the option even exists.) The map and item inspection is broken on anything higher than 720p as well. I've also heard horror stories of the game randomly crashing, so far, out of 2 hours the worst that's happened to me is the bloom balls, lines in objects and stutter that makes it feel slower than 30FPS even though my framerate counter is showing 30FPS solid.

Despite all that, I still recommend it. Why? Well, it's a good game. I've played every Silent Hill game aside from Book of Memories and the arcade games since 2000 and I still like this game and while the story is weird and breaks the SH lore, it's a good stand alone SH title with some really creepy monster designs that are very welcome over Downpour's mediocre creature designs. The combat is also fun, I almost completed it on Xbox without getting hit, failed when it came to the cult members and their cheap tactics though. This port is PLAYABLE but I think the best experience would be if they added it as a backwards compat title to Xbox One. (Downpour is and Homecoming has a large number of voters but alas, no Homecoming on xbox one yet.) If not, the PC version I think is still more superior than the console versions as it DOES look better. (Graphical glitches aside.) And it does look pretty great to be fair, I wasn't expecting a huge difference but there's a clear upgrade in quality over the console versions. I have this on 360 as well and it was great on there but it looks even better on PC, I can make out many more details and textures look way better on PC with full texture filtering at 1080p. It really makes the game pop, the completely dynamic shadow system is great as well, it's really a wonderful looking game that could hold up today if it wasn't for some of the graphical glitches.

Double Helix tends to have a bad rep when it comes to PC ports. MX vs ATV Reflex, also ported by DH while not confirmed on Wikipedia but it is in the game credits is a completely broken mess for a lot of people. It's a shame too because the ground work is there, for both games, MvA: Reflex and Silent Hill: HC. They just need a LITTLE more polish and they'd both be great ports.

I really tried to like it and made many attempts to finish it over the years but every time I got really bored with it or just stumbled upon a game breaking bug that tipped me over the edge and made me stop playing.

What baffles me the most, though, is how horrible the sound quality is in this version. Sound was always one of the most important aspects of Silent Hill games so I just can't believe that they let this shit slip and released the game as it is.

Anyway, I guess there are some positive aspects to Homecoming and you could probably enjoy it for what it is if it wasn't associated with such a cult series but since that's not the case, there are just too many things that drag the experience down for me, personally. Weirdly placed musical queues, predictable story, zero buildup and lack of any scares or a proper mood, annoying combat system that forces you to mow down almost every enemy on your path... The list goes on.

I can only sum it up as a total lack of understanding for what made past SH titles unique and scary. Those games were clever, a great example of a psychological horror with deep mythos and engaging storylines that were always open to interpretation. Homecoming is just dumb. A saturday night horror movie version of Silent Hill with shoehorned references and recycled ideas.

The only thing that I actually enjoyed is the soundtrack by Akira Yamaoka, who even at his worst can produce something that's miles above the rest of this game in terms of quality.","Probably the least compelling Silent Hill game, further dragged down by a crappy PC port.

El juego en sí es difícil en comparación de los antiguos Silent Hill, escasos botiquines y munición, la manera de enfrentar a los enemigos tienes que esquivarlos y saber en que momento atacar, si no pasarás unos malos ratos. si eres fan de la saga Silent Hill, Homecoming merece ser jugado, insisto este juego no es malo, solo que fue distinto a los demás.

Homecoming is by no means a bad game but it's certainly nothing special. The story and enemies straight up do not work with the canonical story and the attempt at refining the combat only leads to more frustration, with clunky mechanics and controls. Not all is bad, however, and the exploration side of the game remains enjoyable despite the fact that the oppressive, terrifying atmosphere from the original games is mostly lacking. Overall, game's a solid 6/10... IF YOU'RE PLAYING THE CONSOLE VERSION.

The PC version is awful. I'm not exaggerating when I say this is one of the worst PC ports I have ever had the displeasure of enduring. The game stutters, crashes and freezes extremely frequently. Wanna save your game? Well you gotta wait for 10 - 20 seconds for the game to unfreeze itself and allow you to do so. I've had cutscenes bug out and play the audio with no visual, freezes whilst walking through the gameworld, and constant framerate drops during combat. 

If you are interested in trying Homecoming, despite it's flaws, PLEASE do yourself a favour and do not play the PC version.","After the sheer brilliance of Silent Hill 1 - 4, the series has slowly fizzled out.

Graphiquement c'est pas une claque, mais ça reste correct pour son époque (même si Silent Hill 3 étais plus réussi sur cet aspect).
Niveau gameplay, ça reprend la recette classique des silent hill, avec en plus la possibilité d'esquiver les attaques, ce qui rend les combats beaucoup trop facile, et casse un peu le côté survival-horror sur la fin, car une fois les esquives maitrisés ce jeu devient d'une simplicité... Au début le jeu est bien corsé et c'est vraiment un plaisir, dommage que la difficulté disparaisse au fil des heures de jeu.

After all of that, if you still need your silent hill (if your like me you know what i mean), then try this on the ps3 if possible. it will diapoint you but its kind of like seeing a close freind after a long time apart, you remember the good times and how they made you feel but you know that things can never be the same. things are different now so you shake hands and part ways. 

This game is a goodbye handshake to a dear friend.

ready for the cliche rating...

here we go...

As vezes os comandos parecem não ser tão precisos e isso pode ser meio complicado em determinados inimigos, a munição escassa é outra dificuldade, mas esse fato é normal na franquia, porém em outros títulos, você quase não usava armas de fogo por causa do comando das armas brancas ser bem simplis e preciso, e nesse Silent Hill em questão, muitos inimigos precisam ser atingidos com tiros... Não o melhor Silent Hill ja lançado, mas ainda sim quem é fã da franquia pode aproveitar ele... Não entendo o motivo da Konami não ter colocado outros jogos da franquia a venda aqui na steam, como Silent Hill 4 - The Room(que inclusive tem uma versão de PC, só não esta disponibilizada aqui na loja), ou então Silent Hill Downpour(que não teve tantas avaliações positivas, mas eu particularmente ja zerei duas vezes e considero um dos melhores da série, e que por sinal, não está aqui também, porque se tivesse, eu compraria COM TODA CERTEZA) outra grande perda para os fãs da série, se trata do Silent Hill HD Collection ( que foi o 2 e o 3 com o grafico um pouco melhorado e foi lançado pra PS3 e X360, mas uma vez a Konami boicotou o PC).

I'll simply leave you some KEY POINT CONS that you either have to deal with or just not play the game. For myself, these cons are too awful for me to bare:

RESOLUTION ISSUES - If you play this game on a 4k TV the best you can do is 1920 x 1080 BUT!!! The map will still be a little off, like a portion of it will be cut. And items you pick up (when they pop up on the screen for you to examine) will be warped/distored. The reccomended setting is a resolution of 720 and you wont have these problems...but most of your screen won't be getting used LOL PC monitor should be tolerable.

GAME FREEZE DURING LOADING SCREENS - Solution - You better play this game on Windowed mode, yes, with borders.

SOUND ISSUES WITH EARPHONES- Sound effects only play through the right side of your earphones. Solution? There aint one because the only two solutions are is to A: use 1.5 surround...which I dont think exists anymore?? At least not for me. I have only 1.7 surround on Realteck and use Kraken Headphones. OR B: don't use headphones that use USB....And who the hell still uses headphone jacks unless youre super old school??

XBOX ONE CONTROLLER USER?? - Like to play your games from the comfort of your sofa on your big screen TV? You might have problems from the very start. It took me 2 HOURS to figure out why the controls were screwed to hell. Fix? In your steam controller settings use the preset controller setting called ""GAMEPAD"" its reccomended for the XBOX One Controller. That works perfectly, for me. OH there is also a MOD you should grab that enables XBOX button Icons to show during gameplay and option to turn off screen grain effect.

RANDOM STARTUP FAILS - Sometimes, no LOTS of times lol, the game won't start up upon first try. You'll get a black screen and it just sits there. Fix? Usually starting the game directly through Steam bares no startup fails.

CAMERA - Shepherd's head/torso is constantly in the way of what you're trying to look at or pick up. I keep getting this urge to like...want to push him out of the way somehow with the camera but it just aint happening LOL

Overall, after all the reasearch and fixes I had to go trhough, the major killers for me is the sound and camera issues. Its highly annoying and bothers me big time that effects are only playing in my right ear and there is nothing I can do about it. I refuse to play atmospheric games like this without headphones, I mean come on!

IF you can tolerate these problems, by all means, try to enjoy this game. But its a very bad port so run through the fixes soon as you can to see how you manage and don't wait too long to get your refund if nothing works. Forty bucks is INSANE!!! I got this on sale for 5 bucks, I think, so I'm not sore missing my refund. But I'm very dissapointed. I'm a Silent Hill fan!!!","OK so I can't recommened this. I just CAN'T!! Terrible port!

Più fedele al film che ai precedenti titoli nel tentativo di arruffianarsi gli spettatori più giovani, con le stesse sexy infermiere come le abbiamo viste al cinema, ma nel complesso è altamente godibile come gioco. È un Silent Hill diverso e va preso così, un avventura assolutamente nuova, senza doverlo paragonare ai capolavori che hanno segnato la saga. Lo consiglio, sia ai fans che ai neofiti.

The game is capped at thirty (cant be fixed via mods), a little buggier than it is on consoles and is just as ugly whilst also being unable to be played at a higher resolution because it will cause more issues with the HUD and etc. The game crashes a lot (it froze on consoles too) and loves to load for ages. Often secretly crashing behind said loading screen even though the images continue to cycle. The story is awful too and it seems to take inspiration from the awful first movie in addition to ripping off the monsters from Silent Hill 2 and 3. The controls are also terrible whether you use a mouse and keyboard or a controller. Settings aside the actual models for people and props are just terrible, looking worse than any of the prior PS2 games. One of the worst games of 08 and possibly the worst Silent Hill game.","I am only updating this review since we are getting more Silent Hill games on Steam now.

Silent Hill: Homecoming tries to emulate the old Silent Hill formula of Silent Hills 1-3 but ends up falling down and breaking its nose. Let me cut straight to the chase. I am keeping this review [b]spoiler free[/b] so don't worry about those. Keep in mind also that this is a review from a person who has only played Silent Hills 1-3.

[h1]Story[/h1]

Much like previous installments in the Silent Hill franchise, it follows a protagonist who ends up in Silent Hill not much out of curiosity but due to being in pursuit of a person. It is practically the story trope of Silent Hill by this point but I am kind of glad that they didn't try anything worse instead of playing safe. However it doesn't feel so polished and the themes it tries to convey do not feel as remarkable or deep as the ones in the previous games. I never really felt that emotionally invested in what was going on and mostly felt quite indifferent. The choices you make during your journey do matter however and it is good that they are clearly presented to the player so that there is no possibility to accidentally make a choice that you didn't want to make. The endings that you get based on these choices however are really disappointing. They are way too short and feel extremely rushed. There are 5 different endings in total but I wouldn't count them adding any replayability for what they offer. You are just better off playing it once through and looking up the other endings on Youtube.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

The gameplay is the Silent Hill standard: [i]explore area A enough until you find what you were looking for then proceed to area B etc. etc. Fight a boss, solve a few puzzles here and there.[/i] However I can't help but feel that this is much more linear than the previous installments. It seems as if you will mostly find everything that there is to get by just going forward. Don't get me wrong, I do know that Silent Hills are known as the broken door simulators but my gripe is the fact that some areas just feel too barren and linear. The puzzles are also too easy and there is no way to adjust the level of their difficulty so that's a bummer as well.

[h1]The Combat System...[/h1]

*sigh* It's like they held a meeting with Konami America, in which Konami said to Double Helix Games: ""I bet you can't mess up the decent and unintrusive combat system which Team Silent developed."" and Double Helix devs looked back at them with faces full of so much [i]challenge accepted[/i] that it wasn't even subtle. Jokes aside, I get that they were trying to make the combat feel more immersive with the dodge mechanics and all, but it is apparent that the whole system was not polished enough. It feels... broken and that's the best way to describe it. Sometimes dodging works, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes our lovely protagonist dodges in the direction he feels like rather than what you are trying to input. Counterattacks are a mixed bag as well, sometimes they connect but sometimes they just don't. This was mostly apparrent during boss fights, in which Alex would blatantly miss hits even though the boss' model was in the weapon's reach. Credit where credit's due though, the mutilating animations you get after finishing an enemy off with a heavy attack feel quite satisfying. However, in trying to make the combat feel different, they have just developed another way into making it as monotone as it was in the previous games. I found that the easiest way to go about things is to do the same combo over and over again with a melee weapon until the enemy dies, or in some cases just mash heavy attack because for some reason that works too. What takes the cake though is that unlike in the previous games combat is quite mandatory way too often. I would mostly choose to avoid combat in the previous games, but in this one you just have to fight in some situations. What also does not help is the fact that most enemies take way too many hits so it makes the encounters feel even more tedious and even more of a pacebreaker. Free aiming with guns could have also potentially been a great inclusion but here it just feels as clumsy as the rolling and dodging mechanics.

[h1]Music and sound design[/h1]

The good old, and might I add, quite nostalgic sound effects are back. The ambiance however is not as strong as what the predecessors had to offer. Akira Yamaoka still knows how to make Silent Hill sound like Silent Hill but there was never really that feeling of anxiety and nervousness, which at least a one or two tracks caused in Silent Hills 1-3. It is not terrible by any means but not really that awe-inspiring either. Also the use of royalty free screams in a couple of points just made me mostly chuckle rather than feel fear.

[h1]A god-awful PC port[/h1]

Where do I even start with this... Let me just list all the issues that I encountered so you get the idea:

-Missing, mistimed or muffled sound during cutscenes.
-Freezing caused by loading and this can happen at any time. At the start of a cutscene, in the middle of a cutscene, during gameplay, before saving, you name it.
-Crashes when loading the next area which became much more frequent as the game progressed.
-Bugged maps when the resolution is above 1280x720. This means that you are not able to see the whole map but rather a portion of it which results in having to zoom and scroll through the map to see where you are going.
-Unable to see photos and drawings you have collected when the resolution is above 1280x720.
-Loop problems in the ambiance.
-Sound playing from only one speaker.

Also there are loads of unskippable cutscenes which is apparently in every version of the game but it is really annoying as well. [b]Getting a game over because you failed a quicktime event? Don't worry, here's the 5 minutes of cutscene that you watched one more time so that you can really feel the frustration if you fail the quicktime event yet again.[/b]

[h1]Questionable choices[/h1]

I had to make a section about this because some decisions which the developers made feel a bit off. For instance, I don't understand the big emphasis on combat in a horror game. We are not playing through a horror game to experience the same monotone encounters with enemies that take way too many hits. As I stated before, you are able to avoid most encounters in Silent Hills 1-3, but here it is downright forced because I guess they want to showcase how ""cool"" and ""epic"" the new mechanics are. But they are not. And I don't understand how neither the developers, nor playtesters saw this. Also the depiction of Silent Hill has taken way too much ""bad influence"" from the movies. Mostly prominent being the inclusion of Pyramid Head. I do understand that Pyramid Head is iconic for Silent Hill but why exactly is it even here. Silent Hill (at least in the previous games) changed in correlation to the visitor's psyche. That is why in Silent Hill 2 James Sunderland was chased by the Pyramid Head because he felt guilty and Pyramid Head was trying to exact punishment for that guilt. Here however Pyramid Head has no role whatsoever, he's just there to remind that ""Hey! This is a Silent Hill game because I am here."". That's the exact same novelty purpose as what it had in the films but it just doesn't work here and feels way too bothersome. It is also a really lazy way to avoid designing something new. Something which the whole game suffers from: [b]Being too much of the same old, same old.[/b]

[h1]tl;dr[/h1]

Silent Hill Homecoming tries to be a good Silent Hill game but fails to deliver that ambition due to a lackluster story and an awful combat system. It does not try enough to be different and the areas it tried to make different feel either broken or uninspired. If you want to play this game, do not buy the PC version. It is riddled with bugs and instability.","Oh boy, I shouldn't have let my curiosity take the best of me because it lead me to play this trainwreck.

It is not terrible by any means but not really that awe-inspiring either. Also the use of royalty free screams in a couple of points just made me mostly chuckle rather than feel fear.

[h1]A god-awful PC port[/h1]

Where do I even start with this... Let me just list all the issues that I encountered so you get the idea:

-Missing, mistimed or muffled sound during cutscenes.
-Freezing caused by loading and this can happen at any time. At the start of a cutscene, in the middle of a cutscene, during gameplay, before saving, you name it.
-Crashes when loading the next area which became much more frequent as the game progressed.
-Bugged maps when the resolution is above 1280x720. This means that you are not able to see the whole map but rather a portion of it which results in having to zoom and scroll through the map to see where you are going.
-Unable to see photos and drawings you have collected when the resolution is above 1280x720.
-Loop problems in the ambiance.
-Sound playing from only one speaker.

Also there are loads of unskippable cutscenes which is apparently in every version of the game but it is really annoying as well. [b]Getting a game over because you failed a quicktime event? Don't worry, here's the 5 minutes of cutscene that you watched one more time so that you can really feel the frustration if you fail the quicktime event yet again.[/b]

[h1]Questionable choices[/h1]

I had to make a section about this because some decisions which the developers made feel a bit off. For instance, I don't understand the big emphasis on combat in a horror game. We are not playing through a horror game to experience the same monotone encounters with enemies that take way too many hits. As I stated before, you are able to avoid most encounters in Silent Hills 1-3, but here it is downright forced because I guess they want to showcase how ""cool"" and ""epic"" the new mechanics are. But they are not. And I don't understand how neither the developers, nor playtesters saw this. Also the depiction of Silent Hill has taken way too much ""bad influence"" from the movies. Mostly prominent being the inclusion of Pyramid Head. I do understand that Pyramid Head is iconic for Silent Hill but why exactly is it even here. Silent Hill (at least in the previous games) changed in correlation to the visitor's psyche. That is why in Silent Hill 2 James Sunderland was chased by the Pyramid Head because he felt guilty and Pyramid Head was trying to exact punishment for that guilt. Here however Pyramid Head has no role whatsoever, he's just there to remind that ""Hey! This is a Silent Hill game because I am here."". That's the exact same novelty purpose as what it had in the films but it just doesn't work here and feels way too bothersome. It is also a really lazy way to avoid designing something new. Something which the whole game suffers from: [b]Being too much of the same old, same old.[/b]

[h1]tl;dr[/h1]

Silent Hill Homecoming tries to be a good Silent Hill game but fails to deliver that ambition due to a lackluster story and an awful combat system. It does not try enough to be different and the areas it tried to make different feel either broken or uninspired. If you want to play this game, do not buy the PC version. It is riddled with bugs and instability."

Side notes:
. Change audio configuration to 5.1 surround sound (this game hates 7.1)
. Do not alt tab, trust me.

I think this entry in the franchise gets an unnecessarily bad rep, and I can see why because in comparison to the masterpieces that were the OG quad-trilogy (SH4 is great fight me) it doesn't compare as it introduces significant changes in areas such as catering to horror movie tropes and cliche's, and just being kinda goofy at times taking away from the dark and disturbing psychological immersion a SH game typically should have to offer, and the story writing just having a lot of loose ends by the end of it. However, that does not mean this is a 'bad game' it's just not exactly a great 'Silent Hill' game if you get me. 

It has a lot going for it, I personally loved and felt like the overall atmosphere, soundtrack and monster designs were all features that the game nailed and did good justice to retain those core factors that make a good fun SH experience enjoyable on paper, oh and another big improvement is the combat no longer feeling clunky as hell and actually having some sort of fluidity for once (I actually cannot stand the combat in older silent hill games generally so this gets big points from me)

Where the game falls short is simply all the other core factors that are expected to be done just as well as the other things I mentioned earlier, such as the story, the attention to detail in the writing being lacklustre and flawed in a few areas, strange and sometimes pointless level design, just not being nearly as imaginative and interesting as any of the older titles, which is a big deal when you're talking about these games of course.

I wish this game got a directors cut release or something because I do like it, but it just feels a bit unfinished by the end of it.

All in all, I genuinely do not think Homecoming is as bad as everyone says it is, if you're an avid fan and if you can grab it on a sale, go for it.

Just do yourself a massive favour and actually try patch the game first before playing instead of these morons who pay full price for it and boot it up, then immediately leave a bad review and refund because it crashed or something.","First and foremost, there is no doubt in my mind when I say this is one hell of a buggy port and isn't really worth playing unless you go ahead and patch it first (or emulate it) so...

Hikaye; Hikaye konusunda her zaman Silent Hill'a güvenin. Bu oyun da zaten hikaye konusunda güveninizi kırmayacak. (Ayrıca,hikaye konusunda kafanızda soru işareti kalan yerler varsa,internette Silent Hill adına açılmış fanwiki'ye bakmanızı tavsiye ediyorum. Her şeyin aklınıza gelmeyecek en küçük detayına kadar bilgisi var o wikide.)
Hikayeye muhtemelen herkes ortalama 4/5 verir. 

Karakterler; Silent Hill'da karakterler her zaman sizden bizden biri gibi olurlar. Karakterlerin sesleri için çok tanınan ve profesyonel sanatçılar çağırılmaz (SH-HD dışında), karakterlerin görünümleri çok zorlanmış olmaz,mesela mükemmel kalçalar veya çok kaslı bir vücut gibi. Bunda da öyleydi,karakterler dışarıya çıktığınızda görebileceğiniz insanlar gibilerdi ve bu oldukça güzel bir şey. 5/5

Seslendirme ve NPC hareketleri; Öne çıkarılmış karakter tepkileri var. Bunu deme sebebim Silent Hill'ın 4.oyununda Henry put gibi durup konuşurken,bir oyun sonrası,yani Homecoming'de, (minik bir SPOILER,ama 4f♥cksake oyunun ilk bölümü neredeyse) Alex ve *** konuşurken,***'ın ""Onları kurtaramazsın."" demesinden sonra Alex'in ""ne diyon amk"" bakışlarıyla ""sonnuvabitch"" demesi,normalde Silent Hill'daki karakterlerin bir yaratığa verdiği tepki (çoğunlukla ""aaa canavar."") yerine daha insancıl bir tepki olması,dile getirilmeye değer bir detay bana kalırsa. Sonunda kontrol ettiğimiz karakter yaşıyor ve duyguları var! Bu yazdığımı abartı olarak buluyorsanız,Silent Hill 3 ve 4'te öldüğünüz zaman ana karakterin  attığı çığlıkları dinlemeniz yeterli bana kalırsa. (Alex'in ölümü bile güzel allahallah) Sesler de karakterlere yakışmış zaten,tek Josh'un sesini beğenmedim,seslendirilmesi için 12 yaşında edgy bir çocuk çağırmışlar sanırım.  5/5

Yaratıklar(?); Bu oyunda cameo karakter olarak Pyramid Head'in olması beni sevindirdi. (Tam olarak cameo değil,ama cameo deme sebebim genel olarak oyun içerisinde cutscene dışında etkileşime girmememiz) Zaten 5 (1 tane de bonus sahne) farklı sondan birinin Pyramid Head ile ilgili olması,hayran kitlesini çok hypelamış. Hemşire hakkında hiçbir şey söylemek istemiyorum,yüzünü kapattığınız an fıstık gibi bir şey oluyor. Yaratıkların tasarımları konusunda bir şey diyemem,baktığınızda ""¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Silent Hill."" diyorsunuz yani. 5/5 <-- sırf Nurse için.afiyet olsun.

Bosslar; Book of Memories'teki gibi,bu oyunda bosslar resmen her seviye sonunda vardı ve bana göre Silent Hill serisindeki en zor bosslardan ikisi de bu oyunda,Scarlet ve Amnion. Oyunu bitirmediyseniz ikisini de araştırmayın. Boss zorlukları kişiden kişiye değişir ama bosslar,özellikle bahsettiğim ikisi,çok uzun sürüyorlardı ve çok fazla birikim gerektiriyorlardı (med-kit,mermi gibi),tabi taktiğini öğrendiğinizde kolaylaşıyorlar. Daha ürkütücü olabilirlerdi ama eğlenceli ve gericiydiler. 4,7/5 

Bulmacalar; Silent Hill zaten bulmacalar ve gizli şeylerin ortaya çıkartılması üzerine işleyen bir korku oyunu temasına sahip,ama sizin için bulmacaları çözmek çok önemliyse ve oynadığınız oyunda karmaşık bulmacalar arıyorsanız,bu oyun size göre değil. Basit puzzlelar vardı. Ben puzzle değil aksiyon ve hikayesi üzerine oynuyorum Silent Hill'ı,bu yüzden benim için pek sorun olmadı. Tam tadındaydı bana kalırsa bulmacaları. 5/5

Kontroller; Alışılması biraz zor. Ben tam olarak kullanabilmeye başladığım zaman ikinci kısımdaydım. Konsolda daha kolay olduğunu söylüyorlar. Ben klavyede oynadım,başlarda işkence gibi gelmişti. Ama dediğim gibi,alışıyorsunuz.Bir karşılaşma sırasında dodgelamak biraz sinir bozucu olabiliyor,özellikle Amnionla savaşırken,ama onun dışında normal yani. 3,8/5
(Amnion oyunun son bossu. Araştırmayın,tekrar söylüyorum. Oyunun hikayesinin büyük bir çoğunluğunu size spoiller.) 

Kayıt sistemi; Oyundaki ilerleyiş, duvardaki bir Halo of the Sun,yani Order'ın simgesiyle kayıt ediliyor. Ama bir süre sonra resmen bir korku unsuru oluyor bu. İlginç bir şekilde bölümler arası kayıt noktasının mesafesi bazen o kadar fazla oluyor ki,oyuncu çok geriliyor. Optimizasyon kusurlu olduğu için iki kayıt noktası arası oyunu oynarken yaratıklardan ve olaylardan çok oyunun kapanmasından korkar hale geldim. Ve aynı sebepten dolayı oyunda kayıt noktası bulduktan sonra kaydetmek isteyip tıkladığınızda bile oyun kapanıyor bazen,orada da bir sıkıntı var yani. Onun dışında,5 tane kaydedebiliyorsunuz bir oyun boyunca. Pardon? Ne? Nasıl yani? Ya ben belli bir bölümü oynamak istiyorsam? Sanırım onlar için böyle bir dünya yok. Eğer belli bir bölümü oynamak istiyorsanız oyunu baştan oynamak zorunda kalıyorsunuz.(Ya da internetten bölümlerin save dosyalarını bulabilirsiniz,ben öyle yaptım bir ara.) Bütün oyunlarda ne güzel 50 slot vardı neredeyse,bunda neden 5 anlamadım. 3,6/5

Müzikler; Akira Yamaoka tam bir dahi ve ben onu çok seviyorum. 10/5 ,ama bir şeye de değinmem gerek,genel olarak SH soundtracklerine baktığımızda bununkiler biraz sönük kalmış. Ama gene de bnne. Ben sevdim. (Tamamen taraflı veriyorum bu notu jfgkjfg)

Atmosfer; Oyun size, çok da gidilebilecek bir alan olmasa da ve her yer Feral-Lurker kaynasa da,gene de free-roam şansı tanımış. Çok da yapabileceğiniz bir şey yok ama caddelerde sisin içerisinde tek başınıza dolaşırken o Silent Hill'ın kendi vibe'ını hissediyorsunuz. Bunu verebilmiş olmaları çok güzel. Bu oyunda da neredeyse hepsinde olduğu gibi yanınızda ve kalbinizde ( </3 ) kimsenin olmaması,sizi zaten olduğunuzdan daha da yalnız hissettiriyor. 5/5

PC üzerine oturmamış,en azından bende öyleydi. 
Genel olarak PC optimizasyonu; 3/5

Şimdi düşündüm de,Silent Hills'ın iptal edilmesi gerçekten de çok kötü. Silent Hill'a ""yeni nesil"" bir oyun şart. 
Hayran kitlesi oyunların ikinci oyundan sonra bozduğunu ortak karar kılmış ama ben buna katılmıyorum. Silent Hill serisini seven herkesin oynaması gereken bir oyun bana kalırsa.

Maintaining tension requires the player to feel vulnerable. Thankfully, SHH keeps this going by keeping the weapons moderately effective.

The story takes you through many of the locations in the small town its set in. It breaks up the town into sectioned off areas so it can be a challenge to quickly get where you want to.

Purtroppo di ciò che furono i capolavori del passato (sh 1, 2 e 3) rimane solo il titolo e qualche effetto sonoro nei menù, e dopo homecoming sono riusciti a fare anche di peggio con Downpour.
Il gioco in sè non è tutto da buttare, le ambientazioni e il gameplay ricalcano vagamente quelle di sh 2, tuttavia non riesce ad avere la stessa profondità e spessore di trama (e ci credo), proprio il paragone con i suoi predecessori risulta il punto debole di tutti i titoli della serie usciti dopo il 3, ma se siete alla ricerca di un survival dai ritmi lenti e dalle ambientazioni lugubri Sh Homecoming potrebbe fare al caso vostro, altrimenti potreste rimanere piuttosto delusi, insomma da assumere con le dovute precauzioni soprattutto per i fan irriducibili della serie.

Its as if Konami and double Helix specifically designed this port to be as stunted and grating as possible so that only the most avid fans stand a chance of enjoying it.

Here are the bullet points:
[list]
[*][h1]Visual[/h1] Camera is atrocious and buggy during quick-time events. Constant freezes, crashes, and clipping slips make the game nigh unplayable in places. In most resolutions, your map is cut and fixed into a small segment, rendering it useless. Half of my time spent on this port was trying to figure out a decent configuration.

[*][h1]Audio[/h1] The equalization is horrible. Dialogue wildly fluctuates between a whisper and a boom, while ambience and sound effects compete in an effort to blow out your speakers. Soundtrack is as top-notch as ever, making the rest of the audio design all the more frustrating.

[*][h1]Gameplay[/h1] The controller support feels rushed and haphazard. Instead of mapping the Xbox controller interface from the console version, as is common for console to PC ports, they decided to make their own mess of an interface that serves more to confuse players than to help them. 
The combat system, in my opinion, is an improvement over previous entries, and for good reason. Whether by design fluke or genuine character background, like it or not, you are playing a protagonist that can actually fight half a damn (for a Silent Hill character). Once you have the mechanics down, most (if not the entire) game can be breezed through with the knife alone. The streamlined game mechanics and less convoluted progression (compared to previous entries), makes sense, considering the unique protagonist, different locale, and extended lore/Cult elements.

[*][h1]Story[/h1] If you're a die-hard Silent Hill fan, chances are you'll hate it. I would not blame you, the forced Pyramid Head cameo alone is grounds enough for execution. However, god help me, I like this game's story, its faults notwithstanding. The possibility of Silent Hill's influence spreading via extended Cult activities, sister communities, or the actions of past residents or ""visitors"" is enticing. This lends itself well to the game's central plot, and actually makes for a thoughtful and heartfelt horror story.

[*][h1]Conclusion[/h1] Having played every Silent Hill game to date, as well as having played this entry on the PS3 back in the day, I wholeheartedly condemn this port as a thoroughly-screwed, half-assed , god-awful mess that is an affront to the franchise, its fans, and gamers in general. Even at 85% off, I would only recommend this purchase for the most committed. Otherwise, don't waste your money.

[*][h1]Conclusion[/h1] Having played every Silent Hill game to date, as well as having played this entry on the PS3 back in the day, I wholeheartedly condemn this port as a thoroughly-screwed, half-assed , god-awful mess that is an affront to the franchise, its fans, and gamers in general. Even at 85% off, I would only recommend this purchase for the most committed. Otherwise, don't waste your money.

   First up, let's talk about the game itself. Sure, it pandered to the ""torture porn"" tropes made popular in its day by the likes of the Saw and Hostel franchises. Not that I have a problem with such influences, other than it being a bit ""obvious"" for the time, and perhaps thereby feeling a bit forced. And sure, it also made the combat a bit too action-y by adding in a dodge mechanic which saw you rolling around the floor like a super-soldier who's OD'd on twinkies (we're a long way from RE1's ""tank"" controls, boys and girls)!

   Such relatively minor criticisms aside, though, it still had some gob-smackingly atmospheric and scary moments, incredible monster designs, some decent puzzles, and on the whole still emerges as one of the last great gasps of what we could perhaps term the ""first generation"" of survival horror video games (beginning with the first Alone in the Dark, and ending around Amnesia: The Dark Descent).

   So that's the game. But what about the PC port?

   Two words: ""shit"" and ""house"", in roughly that order. A complete insult, really, to anyone who once loved this series and everything it stood for.

   The controls? Well, you can remap them, but best cross your fingers they don't just magically re-map themselves back again, and allocate two different functions to a single key at the worst possible moment. The sound? Frankly makes the controls look good. Dialogue and various sound effects - including your own character's FOOTSTEPS - are frequently hard-panned to one side of the speakers/headphones for absolutely no apparent reason, other than...well, I guess they just couldn't be fucked fixing up whatever minor bug occurred during the console to PC transfer..?

   Add to this a multitude of crashes, some of the most ludicrously long load screens you will ever have to endure, and a game-breaking puzzle in which you CAN'T EVEN CONTROL THE HANDS OF THE CLOCK YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SET TO A SPECIFIC TIME (they move in whichever direction they want, and stop at whichever number they choose). And that's game, set and match for me, kiddies. Cheers for the hours of aggravation, Konami, but enough is quite enough.

   The whole port has a distinctly ""that'll do, pig, that'll do"" feel to it, with quality control thrown so far out the window you can't even see where the bastard landed. I now know what Phil Fish and Jonathan Blow are talking about when they say that Japanese games just ain't what they used to be (and they weren't even talking about HORROR GAMES, for fuck's sake)!

   In short, while I would easily consider this one of my Top Fifty Horror Games of all time, I sadly cannot recommend this port to ANYONE. Konami's business practices as regards Steam ports seem disappointingly similar to Capcom's, as neither company seems capable of releasing a truly decent adaptation of their older console games onto PC for reasons known only to themselves; and then invariably see fit to rub salt on the wound by refusing to fix anything for the fans. Meaning, in all honesty, they probably don't deserve any NEW ones.

   If you have this on PS3, just play it on that. Otherwise, take your chances and don't say I didn't warn you (apparently some have gotten past the clock puzzle, but ten minutes of fruitless farting about was indeed the final straw for yours truly).

   Honestly, just buy a second-hand Playstation 3...they're cheap enough by now, and worth it just to play this game and this game alone in the form it was first released. It sure does bring a tear to my eye, though, to think how my two favourite Japanese games companies of all time are apparently now run by hot-and-cold running wankers. Fuck you, Konami (we won't even mention that Silent Hills cancellation, which seemed to merely nonplus poor old Guillermo Del Toro), and fuck you too, Capcom (""HD remasters"", my fully dilated arse-hole). Oh, how the mighty do fall...

Pocit neustálej neistoty sprevádzany tými najzvratenejšími predstavami, akých je ľudská myseľ schopná. Úzkosť dýchajúca Vám na chrbát za každým rohom a depresie z krkolomného ovládania budu vašimi vernými spoločníkmi počas celej hry.

Osobne chovám obrovské sympatie k Japonskému štýlu hororových hier. Musím sa ale priznať, že Homecoming, i keď je považovaný za najslabší diel úspešnej série, bol vôbec mojou prvou skúsenosťou z univerza tajomného Silent Hill. Mohol by som teraz na jeho adresu kľudne vytiahnuť množstvo negatívnych poznatkov o nepresvedčivom nadizajnovaní úrovni, slabšieho grafického spracovania, či spomínaného, nie zrovna pohodlného ovládania.

 Rovnako tak by som sa ale mohol rozplývať nad silným pocitom strachu, ktorý drží v napätí až do samotného záveru. Alebo nad silnou atmosférou, ktorá sa celou hrou linie rovnako, ako hustá hmla vznášajúca sa nad celým Silent Hill-om. S určitosťou však viem, že pozitívne vlastnosti by prevládali v takom rozsahu, že tie negatívne by sa v ich svetle vyparili, ako mlžný opar po chladnom rane.

Silent Hill je nekompromisnou, náročnou a desivou víziou zvrátených mysli. Je však hernými prvkami a mechanikami tak geniálne namixovanou záležitosťou, že Vám nezostane nič iné, než odpúšťať a odpúšťať. Faktom zostáva naozaj vyššia náročnosť súbojov aj adventúrnych prvkov spočívajúcich, nie vždy v úplne logických hádankach. S veľmi obmedzenými zdrojmi v inventari budete musieť často šetriť a dva krát počítať každý vystrelený náboj a dúfať, že už znovu neminiete.

Silent Hill môžete milovať rovnako, ako ho nenávidieť. Nikomu toto právo brať nebudem a ani sa o to nechcem nijak pokúšať. Niečo take nie je v mojej moci. Môžem Vám len napísať o tom, ako som sa do neopakovateľnej atmosféry Japonského hororového umenia opäť zamiloval...",

Die ewig langen Ladezeiten waren eine Zumutung, trotzdem hinderten sie mich nicht daran weiter zu spielen. Silent Hill Homecoming ist für mich ein spannendes und anspruchsvolles Game, dem es an Abwechslung und gruseligen Gegnern nicht mangelt. Auch deren Handlung fand ich richtig gut und die 4 verschiedenen Enden motivieren mich das Spiel weitere Male durchzuspielen.

[h1] Pros	[/h1]
[list]
    [*]The plot is very good and differs itself from the other games enough for it to be surprising all the way through. I say differ enough because it still holds that ""Silent Hill feeling"" to it. It's just great all around.
    [*]The characters are well made and nicely fleshed out, so you will most likely get a connection with them.
    [*]The enviroment is superb. The (new) town of Shepherd's Glen is amazing, and so are all of the other places you visit. It is a little more linear than, say, SH2 for example, where you had a big city for you to walk around and figure where to go next.
    [*]As the first ""next gen"" (ps3 and xbox 360 era) Silent Hill game, it does a wonderful job of bringing the technology on par with modern games. The graphics are great, with a highlight to facial animation. Mechanics were reworked to bring them to the new age, such as combat, movement, camera control and shooting.
    [*]Great voice acting. The voices fit and don't have that ""so bad it's bizarre"" feeling past games had. This time they are properly acted.
    [*]The soundtrack is sooo good. Akira Yamaoka is just a god when it comes to creating music for Silent Hill games.
    [*]Enemies are well designed and, as usual, have a lot of symbolism.
    [*]One thing that I really like about this game is how the main character, Alex, reacts to what's happening around him. I clearly remember the first time I played a Silent Hill game (it was Silent Hill 2), and when monsters started showing up, the main character appears to just ignore the bizarre situation. Even when talking to other people, I was like ""just tell them you are facing god damn monsters around this evil town"", but that never happened. It was like, for the main character, it was all supposed to be that way. In Homecoming, however, Alex acts just the way I described above. I felt utter joy when a new monster appeared and Alex went ""what the hell is this thing"". Heck, you even tell other people you've met monsters and they say they have been seeing the same things. It's just a relief.
    [*]Nicely optimized, despite the questionable pc port. When not facing the random fps drops, I could run this really smothly on my very cheap build.

Tem algum memory leak que faz os loadings e os savings ficarem cada vez mais lentos quando joga.
As vezes iniciava mas os controles do XBOX 360 não eram reconhecidos, precisando sair do jogo e entrar novamente.
De-sync dos sons com as imagens em algumas cut scenes.
Combate é uma merda. É muito difícil desviar dos inimigos.
QTEs as vezes não funcionavam, por mais que eu malhasse os botões.
Alguns save points muito espaçados.

E mais...

O jogo é estranho, o terror é psicológico. Como um bom Silent Hill, mexe com problemas mentais.
Os bosses são animais (centopéia humana, uma boneca pernuda, um golum que cai de um saco, etc)
Animações bem feitas
Clima opressivo e depressivo
Bastante variação de ambientes

Se puede jugar con mando (aunque no sea realmente necesario), y destaco especialmente la OST y los efectos de sonido, que hacen mucho porque la experiencia sea inmersiva.

Aunque Steam no lo indique, el juego SÍ está en castellano.

¿qué problemas he encontrado?

- Los FPS están limitados (30)
- Crashes de pantalla que surgen aleatoriamente en ciertas pantallas de carga.
- Los tiempos de carga no abundan, pero son molestos y elevados.
- Tiene pinta de ser un port cutre de la versión de consolas.

29888946,english,2017.01.13 06:38,✅,✅,0.5,0,"Before looking at any reviews, I started up this game and played through the first hospital/Insane Asylum area. I was playing late at night, with the lights off (the only way to play horror games), and that heavy on my heart feeling, the one a felt when I watched the first Silent Hill movie, started coming back. My chest was tightening up. I didn't know what was going to pop out at me. The whole twitching nurses with no faces, rigidly walking around the room in the dark definitely sent chills down my spine.

I'm a horror genre fanatic, so for a game to scare me or more accurately make me feel uncomfortable, is a big feat. It wasn't necessarily that it scared me, so much as that feeling of unease came over me. Especially when the sirens blared out across the city and the true face of Hell became apparent.

While, obviously not the best horror/thriller movie out there, Silent Hill did give me some uneasy-wtf moments. The part with Pyramid Head ripping off the girls skin particularly struck a cord with me. The point being, at this beginning part in the hospital, the atmosphere, the creatures, the music it all made me feel like I had stepped into that movie. It was awesome, and frightening at the same time.

I used an Xbox One controller for certain games such as this. But even after spending copious amounts of time tweaking the button options so that the onscreen picture of a specific button to press (such as a green button with a 2 on it) to match my controller, it was still janky. I got it to work fairly decent but there were still those moments when you had to guess which button the game wanted you to press.

After that first level, things started to go down hill. The town definitely had the feel of the silent Hill town, especially the Silent Hill 2 town. However, as other have stated, it just wasn't the same. It seems like the developers were trying to be more true to the movie than to the series.

Overall, the game wasn't horrible. I don't feel like that odd hell-bound creepiness of the movie and beginning sequence was ever correctly demonstrated througout homecoming. Nonetheless, the story was fairly interesting (though corny and predictable at times). The puzzles were not that difficult, which in my opinion was fine. 

I would recommend playing this game while it is on sale, and you are looking for a decent dark fantasy ish game. Think of it as the Resident Evil 6 of the Silent Hill series.

Mam mieszane przeżycia, ale jeśli miałbym być szczery... Naprawdę mi się spodobała! :D Moim zdaniem jest dobra (ale bez przesady) i nawet miałbym o niej lepszą opinię, gdyby nie te laggi, które czasem występują. Tutaj macie moją listę zalet i wad:

ZALETY:
- Dobry soundtrack
- Kreatywne i dobre bossy, które mogą przestraszyć (np. mnie Scarlett o dziwo)
- Całkiem ciekawe postacie
- Plot twisty
- Klimacik
- Tajemnicze zakończenia, dzięki którym w głowie roją się teorie (jak dla mnie)

WADY:
- Laggi i czasem gra przestaje działać
- Nienajlepsza fabuła
- Lokacje z gry, które jakoś nie wpasowują się w Silent Hill (oprócz szpitala z początku gry)

W sumie to wszystko co mogę wymienić. Mogę polecić grę, jeśli lubi się surviwal horrory i Silent Hill, ale ostrzegam przed naprawdę irytującymi laggami oraz w niektóre części rozgrywki mogą się niezbyt spodobać... :/ Tak, czy siak moim zdaniem warto kupić, a tym bardziej na przecenie, czyli gdzieś za 5 euro. :D

Homecoming is the fifth sequel in the series and it is rather clear that the francise is going downhill compared to the first three masterpieces. The original team is not involved in the development (except the music composer I think); the torch has been passed to a western team. 
The resulting game is definitely not in the same league as the original triad, but it has some good moments. 

Pros:
+ second part of the game (after sewers) is denser, better and more scary.
+ very nice design of some bosses.
+ good use of lightning and shadows.
+ music is excellent, perhaps the best aspect of the game.
+ some concepts of the main story are distrurbing and shocking (some may find them too disturbing).
+ the design of the Otherworld.
+ puzzles are reasonable.

Cons
- Not surprisingly a vey bad console port with numerous technical bugs: the loading times are enornous, sometimes the game freezes for a few seconds or (more rarely) it crashes. This can be very annoying especially as saves occur at specific places.
- The buttons of the controller seem to be wrongly mapped and I could not find a way to correct them. The map of the game is bugged in the zoom modes.
- Early in the game at some regions (especially Police Station) the game is too much action-oriented. Way too many enemies and combat. It is a bit strange as the difficulty seems to spike there and then it drops. Hint: avoid conformations while on streets, almost all enemies can be avoided. 
- Some maps are frustrating (Police Station) or boring (Sewers)
- There is a variety of melee weapons but it seems that the very first one you encounter is the most efficient.
- Some enemies are rather repetitions from past games (nurses, pyramid man). The element of the psychological horrors being mapped onto physical manifestations is simply not there.  
- the dodge system seems unresponsive as if there is some kind of lag. 

The current price of around 20Euros is too high. Buy at discounted price if you are willing to bypass the technical problems with the extra advice to have low expectations if you are a fan of the originals.

give game some credit puzzles are actually kind a cool and they have that silent hill spirit in them

visuals-the games visuals are nice there isnt much say about it,aside otherworld transition thats been taken from the movie and some monster designs are cool particulary on the bosses

cons-
-way too combat oriented
-boring characters
-broken combat

visuals-the games visuals are nice there isnt much say about it,aside otherworld transition thats been taken from the movie and some monster designs are cool particulary on the bosses

unfortunatly game has technical issues-game quite often freezes for aprox. ten seconds and sometimes crashes,plus there is a bug here and there

to sum up-pros
+visuals
+puzzles
+some monster designs
cons-
-way too combat oriented
-boring characters
-broken combat
-bugs here and there
-occasional crashes
-often game freezes itself

verdict
-silent hill:homecoming isnt good.i wouldnt recommend this game because of  its technical issues and combat,thats broken.if you want to try this game,wait til price gets under 5 dollars

A trama de ""Silent Hill: Homecoming"" apresenta um novo herói, Alex Shepherd, um soldado ferido em combate que está a caminho de casa, na pequena cidade de Sheperd's Glen. Assombrado por pesadelos que giram ao redor de seu irmão mais novo, Josh, Alex encontra o lugar tomado por uma estranha névoa e sua mãe em estado catatônico. Para tornar a situação ainda mais intrigante para ele, o ex-combatente descobre que o pai desapareceu ao sair em busca de Josh.
Logo Alex passa a ser atormentado por visões aterrorizantes de figuras célebres da franquia, além de outras referências ao passado que só fãs da série irão reconhecer. Tudo piora quando ele se vê explorando a cidade de Silent Hill, que é vizinha de Shepherd's Glen, e começa a desvendar um grave segredo ocultado por sua família a respeito das origens do lugar.

""Silent Hill: Homecoming"" é mais ágil, mais intuitivo e mais simples que os anteriores. Tais mudanças, ao menos para certos fãs mais ardorosos, podem ter justamente acabado com o grande charme da franquia, o que não é de todo justo. Embora não seja especialmente inteligente ou tecnicamente corajoso, o jogo ainda preserva qualidades suficientes para intrigar uma boa parcela de seu público-alvo e manter a franquia respirando com dignidade.

SILENT HILL:

A leggyengébbre sikeredett rész. A történet átlagos, megint keres egy nagy csávó egy gyereket (alias Silent Hill 1), a szereplők nem elég karakteresek, kevés az érzelmi töltet. Sőt, Alex egy hidegvérű gyilkoló gép inkább.

Sajnos hiányoznak a játékból a misztikumok, rejtélyek. Silent Hill 2-ben pl minden egyes helynek megvolt a maga története, lehetett agyalni és képzelegni, vajon milyen borzalmas dolgok történhetet minden egyes szobában. Itt nem fogsz semmi ilyet érezni. A szobák ismétlődnek, nem ijesztőek, az emberek megjelenése meg lazít a játék félelmetességén, nem érezzük eléggé egyedül magunkat. Túl sokat lazít.

Sok az értelmetlen történés is a játékban. Szóval a fiatal csajszi pakolgatja ki az eltűnt emberek képeit a falra, hm? Észre se veszi, hogy körülötte pár méterre förtelmes kutyák rohangálnak. Még ha egy megőrült nő lenne...
Alex-et nem érdekli egyáltalán, hogy mik azok a mentésként szolgáló szimbolumok a falakon? Nem hezitál belenyúlni a véres falba, beleugrani a sötét lyukakba... De legalább tudd 10 métert zuhanni a hátára, hogy aztán 2 másodperc alatt felpattanjon, mert jön egy szörny...

Ettől függetlenül talán azt mondhatom, hogy egyszer végigjátszható típusú game lehetne, de nem az, inkább... 

----
SZOFTVER:

...EGY NAGY RAKÁS, HATALMAS, BÜZÖLGŐ ....! Elmondom én mikkel lehet szembesülni a játék során:

- A felbontást 1024x768-ra állítva lehet csak grafikai hibáktól mentesen játszani (nagyobb felbontáson torzulnak a tárgyak modeljei, nem lehet a térképet látni, ect)
- Van, amikor elkezd a 30 cap-es játék szaggatni. Nem bírja biztos a 1060-as kártyám, gondolom...
- Nagyon hosszú töltési idők vannak, kb 20-30mp. Ezenkívül van, hogy a játék is megmerevedik 15 másodpercre
- Géptől függően nem jó hang. Ha szerencséd van, bizonyos jeleneteknél csak valamivel halkabban hallod a karakterek beszélését, ha peched, akkor egyáltalán nem (!) vagy fel kell tekerned 100%-kal a hangerőt, hogy valami sustorgást legalább halj.
- Véletlenszerűen kifagyhat a játék. Bármikor. Ritkán, de bármikor.
- Lövőfegyverekkel van, amikor nem tudsz lőni, hiába nyomogatod a gombot.
- Puzzle feladatoknál rosszul érzékeli a kurzort és a hajad téped, mire nagynehezen sikerül valamit beállítanod.
- Az egyik boss esetén, ha meghaltam, majd checkpointot visszatöltötte, gyorsabb lett a mozgása kb 15%-kal. 6x halálnál inkább visszatöltöttem egy régebbi mentést, mert lehetetlenség volt már bármit is csinálni ellene :D A második boss-nál volt ez.
- Az óra puzzle nem fogadta el a helyes feladványt!
- ...és még van egy halom glitch a játékban, ami megakadályozhatja, hogy tovább tudj játszani.

Ezenkívül a játék irányítása borzalmas, a kitérés nem igazán akar működni, mentéspontok nagyon ritkán vannak és hülye helyeken, a checkpointok szintén. A játékmenet lineáris, ha kinyitsz egy ajtót, akkor általában nem tudsz visszamenni, hiába láttál ott még egy tárgyat vagy fegyvert, rajzot. Á-á. Nem fogsz visszamenni barátom, majd ha újrajátszod. Én így hagytam ki valszeg a mesterlövész puskát, mert nem mentem be egy helyre érte, visszamenni meg már nem lehetett...

Ha a játéknehézségét szeretnénk egy görbével leírni, egy hatalmas kiugrást lehetne rajzolni a seriff irodája részétől a Fitch irodájáig. Tonnaszám kapod a legnehezebben megölhető enemyket (és nem egyenként jönnek, hanem kettesével minimum), elfogy a lőszer és az összes egészségcsomag. (Én ennél a résznél letöröltem a játékot és megpróbáltam refoundolni a steamnél, annyira felbosszantott. Ekkor már benne volt 6 órám, szóval nem adták vissza a pénzem. Másik taktikát alkalmaztam és sikerült túl lendülni rajta nagynehezen.

Szóval ez,... ez valami borzalmas. Én nem tudom, hogy képzelték, hogy így kiadják a game-t pc-re és kijelentik, hogy nem javítják a bugokat.

-----
Tippek, melyek segíthetnek elkerülni, hogy sokat szívj a játékkal:
- Mindig szeparáltan ments. Ha új épületbe érkezel, az a mentés legyen külön, ha egy puzzle megoldást megcsinálsz, legyen külön. Azért, mert ha behibásodik a játék, tovább tudj menni egy régebbi mentésből újra megcsinálva.
- Amikor csak tudod, kapcsold ki a lámpát
- Amikor lehet, fuss. Ha már sokadszorra kapod az áldást, pl seriff irodája rész, memorizáld a felvehető dolgokat és fuss el inkább az ellenségek mellett. Rengeteg med kitet és lőszert spórolsz.
- Clock puzzle, a szülők házában, miután bezáródik a bejárati ajtó: először ezt csináld meg, mert ha bármi más puzzle-t oldasz meg előtte, akkor nem fogja elfogadni a helyes választ, csak valami véletlenszerű értéket. Nekem végig kellett pörgetnem az összes óra összes percén, mire sikerült kitalálni (hiába na, kitartó vagyok)
- Használj kést. Minden nehezebb fegyver annyira lassú, hogy csak a med kitet pazarolod a használatukkal.
- Amint tudod használd el a szérumokat, hogy növeld az életerőd. Én nem tudtam mire való, mert semmi leírás nincs hozzá a játékban, utána kellett olvasgatnom. Azt hittem valami extra boost.

------
Végszó: Ez a játék tényleg egy rémálom. Csak ehhez nem kell lekapcsolni a lámpát.",

26443523,french,2016.10.06 01:04,✅,✅,0.8793269396,104,"Avant tout, je tiens à préciser que je suis fan de survival horror, que j'aime la série des Silent Hill, mais que je voue surtout un véritable culte à Silent Hill 2.
Je n'ai jamais retrouvé ce que j'ai vécu avec Silent Hill 2, y compris dans les autres épisodes de la série, et je crois que ça n'arrivera jamais plus.

Bien entendu je n'en attendais pas autant de Homecoming, j'espérais juste un bon Silent Hill, mais devant les critiques mitigées, j'ai vraiment très tardé avant d'y jouer.
J'ai fait fi du fait que cet épisode ait été réalisé par une équipe différente, j'y ai joué comme j'aurai pu jouer à n'importe quel autre Silent Hill et avec l'esprit ouvert.

L'enthousiasme de mes débuts s'est malheureusement peu à peu étiolé, alors que j'identifiais la nature de ce jeu: ses points forts...puis ses problèmes.
Le gameplay est plus action, mais pour moi il fonctionne à peu près, et il s'explique par le profil du personnage principal.
Je n'ai rien contre un épisode de la série Silent Hill ou ce dernier sait à peu près se défendre pour une fois.
( même si je trouve que la première arme que l'on trouve: le couteau, est vraiment trop efficace de par sa rapidité comparé aux autres armes blanches).
Sauf que ce n'est pas une raison pour baser tout le jeu sur les affrontements !
En gros ce Homecoming emprunte la formule plus si nouvelle que ça des jeux AAA de maintenant, à savoir suivre un véritable couloir, rythmé par des combats obligatoires ou non.
J'ai vraiment été choqué par l’absence d'exploration, et je trouve ça triste que cela arrive aussi à cette série qui n'a rien à voir.
On pouvait presque toujours se promener plus ou moins librement dans la ville dans les anciens épisodes, ce qui était l'un des éléments clés de la licence.
Ici on a le droit qu'à un seul petit quartier minuscule en extérieur, et les niveaux intérieurs sont ultra linéaires.
Heureusement les énigmes, pas toujours évidentes, sont toujours là.
La difficulté a globalement été revue à la hausse par rapport aux autres Silent hill qui étaient beaucoup trop simples.
Dans Homecoming, on ressent vraiment le côté survival horror : peu de munitions et soins vraiment utiles.

Quant à l'ambiance et la dimension artistique, le résultat est en demi teinte.
On retrouve l’atmosphère à la fois malsaine et planante de Silent Hill: les musiques et les bruitages sont très réussis, et les designs des quelques nouvelles créatures font partie des meilleurs de la série.
Mais pour le reste, on a malheureusement l'impression que les développeurs ont bêtement suivi un cahier des charges sans ambition, sans aucune originalité, pour que cela ""ait l'air de Silent Hill"".
Ils ont repris tous les environnements et le bestiaire des anciens épisodes, quasiment du copié/ collé, sans oublier de plagier aussi un peu le film tant qu'on y est.
Homecoming reste inquiétant et stressant, mais le niveau de peur des anciens Silent Hill n'est jamais atteint

En ce qui concerne l'histoire, même constat.
Elle est intrigante, elle a du potentiel car elle est à la fois ""sataniste"" et psychologique, mais elle ne fonctionne qu'à moitié.
Elle s'inspire un peu trop du côté religieux de la plupart des Silent Hill et de Silent Hill 2.
Du coup on a encore l'impression que les développeurs ont cherché à mixer ce qui avait déjà été fait, mais de façon moins subtile et moins travaillée, au lieu de créer vraiment la leur.
De plus, une certaine incohérence m'empêche d'apprécier pleinement le scénario.
Il y a tout de même des choses à déchiffrer, et les monstres, dans leur designs torturés, ont vraiment du sens, ce qui est un bon point.

Il y a de la beauté dans ce jeu, et je mentirais si je disais que je n'ai pas apprécié l'expérience.
Le gameplay plus action est efficace, et l'histoire et ses symboles disséminés ci et là touchent et peuvent faire réfléchir.

Mais l'expérience est malheureusement gâchée lorsqu'on a déjà joué aux anciens titres.
Mon ressenti global, c'est que les développeurs ne se sont pas approprié Silent Hill, ils n'ont pas su insuffler une identité propre à leur Homecoming.
A la place, ils ont très scolairement appliqué une recette, sans grande inspiration, de ce qui a déjà été vu et revu dans les volets précédents et le film, comme une sorte de patchwork qui manque d'âme.

En tant que survival horror, il fait le taf, en revanche en tant que Silent Hill il est un peu décevant pour les raisons que j'ai expliquées.
Homecoming n'est pas un mauvais jeu, c'est juste un survival horror correct, et sans doute un des moins bons épisodes de la série des Silent Hill.
Il convient davantage à quelqu'un qui n'a jamais joué à un Silent Hill, et qui recherche un survival horror sympas sans prise de tête.
Je le conseil tout de même, mais pour un public averti.


* Points forts :

+ Graphiquement correct.
+ L'ambiance
+ Le design des nouveaux monstres
+ La modélisation et les animations des monstres
+ Le gameplay action des combat qui fonctionne
+ Le challenge (moins de ressources etc.)
+ Les énigmes
+ Une histoire qui a du potentiel...
+ Les nombreux commentaires du personnage sur les environnements
+ La bande son

* Points faibles :

- Pas aussi effrayant que les anciens Silent Hill
- Trop de réutilisations des anciens Silent Hill ( créatures, environnements, etc)
- Beaucoup trop dirigiste
- Un poil trop action
- Le couteau un peu cheaté ?
- Histoire pas assez travaillée
- Manque globalement d'inspiration
- Mauvais portage PC ( crashs, freezes, longs temps de chargements, etc)

The first problem is that occasionally it just ""stops working"" and exits to windows. It happend several times throughout the game randomly.

The second is that the game freezes for some time while playing or when you try to save or before cutscenes. When this happens the game doesn't crash but you see one frame for a while and you can continue after that. But this is very annoying since it happens a lot.

The third is the controls. I played it with mouse+keyboard. The movements are sluggish. You get killed while you're waiting for the character to stop a previous attack or when you exit the ""fight mode"" it takes time until you can dodge properly. 
Solving the puzzles with the mouse is a nightmare. Sometimes you need to click 10-20 times until it does what you want.

La jugabilidad es muy buena, aunque tiene sus fallos, el juego implementó un nuevo sistema de ataque con cuchillo, cuando se está cara a cara con un enemigo se debe esquivar y atacar cuando es debido, algunos adversarios resultan más difíciles que otros pero a la final si dominas sus ataques los terminaras venciendo muy fácil, no se puede correr, y para interactuar siempre se debe pulsar el botón izquierdo del mouse, se deben resolver puzles para avanzar en el juego así como también tomar decisiones e incluso elegir respuestas cuando ocurra algún evento significativo, de esto dependerá cual será el final.

La historia es compleja y para su entendimiento es bueno leerse alguna explicación, al igual que el simbolismo en los monstruos, etc; el juego se centra en Alex Sheperd, un soldado proveniente de la guerra que vuelve a su pueblo natal en Sheperd´s Glen. Alex encuentra el pueblo en un estado de decadencia, abandonado y frio, y a su pequeño hermano Joshua desaparecido. Mientras Alex avanza en la búsqueda de su hermano menor, descubre sobre la Orden –el culto de Silent Hill- así como sobre la historia del pueblo y de si mismo.

En mi experiencia debo decir que el juego es bueno, pero no más que eso, me encontré con cantidad de bugs, lags y se me ha crasheado muchas veces a lo largo del jueguito, cosa que no tiene nada que ver con mi PC, según he leído el juego estuvo muy mal desarrollado para PC, y mucha gente lo critico por eso, además el sistema de guardado es malísimo, hay que recorrer bastante para encontrar un punto de guardado, la historia es muy buena y, los gráficos son excelentes aunque pudieron ser mejores, el diseño visual y los escenarios son tremendos y generan esa tensión clásica de la saga, terroríficos monstruos y soberbio giro final.

A little backstory to begin the review: 

I've been exposed to Silent Hill since early childhood. My father would play and I would curiously watch but cover my eyes when the really disturbing moments happened. At about 13 years of age I took on my first SH game in the form of SH: Origins for PSP, which in my opinion was a very good game, considering the technical constraints of a handheld. Although not too scary, Origins possessed the desired atmosphere and a good story. I thought to myself that sooner or later I should explore the SH universe a bit more. 

Quite recently I noticed that Steam actually had Silent Hill: Homecoming up in the store. The $39.99 price tag, however, turned me the f*ck off, so I wishlisted it and patiently waited for a price drop that never took place. Thanks to a third party reseller (most of you guys know who I'm talking about), I bought this game for $9 and began the journey.

I originally owned this game for the PS3, and while my dad has beaten it before, I have not really paid attention to his gameplay nor the story, so I decided to tackle the game myself several years later. 

Firstly I would like to mention that I have started playing this Steam version on my desktop back at home, took the save files with me to college, and continued on a laptop there. I was able to select suitable settings and beat the game successfully from start to finish. I understand the disappointment of the people that bought it and were frustrated by graphical glitches, but it seems that this is merely a compatibility issue and not a universal game-breaking bug or anything of that sort. I am not going to defend the developers for poor optimization, which they should have surely worked more on, but if you aren't certain that it will work on your PC, don't spend $40. Grab a cheap copy for the Xbox 360 (~$5) and you'll be better off.

Now, there were definitely several issues that I experienced with this PC port:

1) Super long loading screens 
2) Long pauses during gameplay when Alex went from one area to the other and the map was supposedly loading very slowly in the background (which made you think that the game froze)
3) Several instances when everything turned white and I couldn't see where I was going, causing to restart from checkpoint
4) Alt+tab made the game crash

Although these issues can be very annoying, they personally have not affected my overall impression of the game, because luckily for me they all happened pretty close to checkpoints and I was able to start over. 

Putting the technical aspect aside, the story was pretty interesting. This was one of the few video games where I actually watched and paid attention to every single cutscene, as I usually just skip them over. I was sucked into the atmosphere for good, and to be honest, despite my current age, I was still a little scared to play through some areas and my gaming sessions would last a little over an hour as I needed a break from the horror. I am definitely aware that this game is not even close to being the scariest in the series, as the original four titles were the most iconic, however I still feel that it did not fail to impress with its setting, characters,  script, and unusually good combat. What I think slightly ruined the overall impression were the poorly animated facial features during close-up dialogues, considering it was not 1999 anymore and the technology was there, but maybe the budget was cut short and so there wasn't enough resources to execute everything to the max. (fun fact: the Japanese release for this game never happened.) In my opinion, release of Homecoming is the beginning of Konami's carelessness towards the franchise, letting it roll downhill ever since.

What I really wish is that the original four games get released here on Steam for a reasonable price and with several graphical improvements. I am quite confident that both hardcore fans and beginners like me would have a blast.

Overall, even despite all the bullsh*t, I really enjoyed Silent Hill: Homecoming and I am certainly growing more and more attracted to the Silent Hill universe (perhaps getting old enough to understand it.) If you guys can find a cheap key - try this game out. If you still have console versions of the older games - replay them. The atmosphere is amazing.

What I think slightly ruined the overall impression were the poorly animated facial features during close-up dialogues, considering it was not 1999 anymore and the technology was there, but maybe the budget was cut short and so there wasn't enough resources to execute everything to the max. (fun fact: the Japanese release for this game never happened.) In my opinion, release of Homecoming is the beginning of Konami's carelessness towards the franchise, letting it roll downhill ever since.

What I really wish is that the original four games get released here on Steam for a reasonable price and with several graphical improvements. I am quite confident that both hardcore fans and beginners like me would have a blast.

Overall, even despite all the bullsh*t, I really enjoyed Silent Hill: Homecoming and I am certainly growing more and more attracted to the Silent Hill universe (perhaps getting old enough to understand it.) If you guys can find a cheap key - try this game out. If you still have console versions of the older games - replay them. The atmosphere is amazing.

Côté scénario, le jeu est très bien, même s'il est en dessous des originaux de la silent team et de ceux de Climax UK. Le jeu prend appui sur des idées reprises du film de Gans (et pas les moins bonnes) et ressort surtout sur un côté Stephen Kingien (La Brume) avec un côté Hostel (qui plairait selon les gôuts)

Côté gameplay, ça fâche un peu. L'orientation action est trop soutenue pour des combats très inégaux face à certains Boss et Mobs (Le bon de fin est d'une facilité par rapport au premier !!) Les saves sont inégalement réparties et font très souvent RAGER. (jamais après un boss...)

Enfin, ce qui me fait avec désespoir râler, c'est qu'il m'a fallu parcourir le net en son intégralité pour le faire rouler. Car oui, SH Homecoming est un portage PC pitoyable. et Konami n'a jamais pris d'attention pour l'améliorer.  Le jeu crash souvent et des freeze de plus de 20 sec arrivent souvent quand on va sauvegarder ou avant/après des cut scenes. 

Au désespoir des joueurs, qui espère trouver des save pour ne pas avoir à tout refaire le temps que le jeu ne PLANTE PAS ...

Alex kardeşi ve Joshua'yı bulmak için hiç beklemeden hemen yola koyulur.

Önceki oyunlardan farklar
Önceki oyunlardan en büyük farkı bence yalnızlık ortamı. Kasabada gezinirken o yalnızlığı çok iyi bir şekilde hissediyorsunuz. Bu ortam bile sizi ürkütmeye yetiyor. 

Grafiklerde diğer oyunlara göre daha başarılı. Ancak sadece daha başarılı. Oyunun grafikleri için ""Yeni Nesil"" olacağı söylenmişti. Ancak pek de ""Yeni Nesil"" olacağa benzemiyordu. Ve olmadı da. Grafikler sadece iyi olmakta kaldı.

Kontroller

Eğer mümkünse oyunu bir kolla oynayın. Çünkü tam kontrol için sürekli tuşlara basmak benim gibi bazılarının sinirlerini bozabiliyor. Oyun boyunca kontrollerde hızlı olmanız gerekmiyor, ancak gene de ben size kol tavsiye etmiş olayım.

Kayıt Noktaları 

Silent Hill oyunlarının klasiği olarak belli yerlerdeki kayıt noktaları ile oyunu kayıt edebiliyoruz. Ancak farz edelim ki çok ilerledik ve kayıt etmeden öldük. Ya da kayıt noktasını fark etmedik. Geriden başlayacak olmamız gerçekten çok sinir bozucu. 

Dövüş Taktikleri

Oyunda bence dövüşler yeterince zor olmamış. Rakibi sersemlet, sonra ağır atağını yaparak öldür. Felsefeniz bu olmalı. Zaten başka bir felsefe yok. Savunmada ise tam rakibimiz bize darbeyi atmadan önce boşluk tuşuna basıp takla atarak hamleden kaçabiliriz. Bunun ardından rakibimize yaptığımız birkaç küçük hamle rakibimizi sersemletecektir. Sonra da ağır atak ile rakibimizi öldürebiliriz.

Son Sözler
Oyun puanlarına diğer yerlerde baktığımda hep düşüktü. Genel olarak kimse beğenmemiş hatta bu oyuna serinin en zayıf halkası diyenler olmuş. Ancak ben ise bu oyunu çok beğendim. Bana soracak olursanız bence serinin en güzel oyunu bence bu oyundur. Size tavsiyem bu oyunu mutlaka oynayın.

[spoiler]Hace poco me volví a pasar el juego y he hecho algunas modificaciones en la review, la mayoría cosas de ortografía y redacción porque quise mantener la esencia del análisis del Harry del 2016. [/spoiler]

Silent Hill Homecoming es la sexta entrega de la saga que se lanzaría en setiembre del 2008 y con la novedad que sería el primer juego de Silent Hill en llegar a PC (Steam) y el único lamentablemente.

Sobre este juego hay mucho que comentar principalmente por la división de los fans y crítica, personalmente como fan de la saga desde que tengo memoria, y habiendo jugado todos los juegos a excepción del Downpour [spoiler](Ya lo jugué)[/spoiler], puedo hacer una crítica en base a lo que aprendí como fan de la saga y del género del survival horror.

Para mí Silent Hill y Resident Evil (bueno lo que era Resident Evil) son los principales referentes del género survival horror, siendo ya casi dos sagas muertas [spoiler](Eran)[/spoiler], RE por lo que se convirtió y SH por lo que se quedó en el olvido para Konami, tenía muchas expectativas sobre Homecoming, veía trailers, imágenes y se veía muy bien, pero leía comentario de personas que decían que era un juego malo, que no tenía nada que ver con SH, que era puro fanservice, que era un insulto para la saga etc, etc, etc, claro, la mayoría sin argumentos claros, hasta que me animé a jugarlo, y cumplió con todo lo que tenía que cumplir, tanto como SH y como survival horror.[spoiler](Es decente).[/spoiler]

A diferencia de muchos, yo empecé a jugar este juego con la idea de que sería un buen SH, pero que no superaría a sus antecesores por el simple motivo de que esos juegos nunca serán superados, SH 1, 2, 3, 4 y origin, son clásicos, esos juegos siempre tendrán un recuerdo en tu corazón, ningún juego por más gráficos realistas que tenga,o una historia perturbadora e intrigante, una ambientación brutal, hablo del cancelado Silent Hills, ni aunque  ese juego hubiese tenido todo eso, nunca hubiera podido ofrecerte esa sensación de la primera vez que probaste SH, son tantas emociones inexplicables con palabras, tantos sentimientos que ningún juego de lo volverá a dar, porque los clásicos no se superan con nada, mucha gente pensó que Homecoming podría si quiera igualar alguno de sus antecesores, eso, cualquier fan de corazón de la saga, sabe que es imposible.

Homecoming cuenta la historia de Alex Shepherd, un joven soldado que regresa a casa después de hacer servicio a la patria, cuando llega se da cuenta que su padre y hermano están desaparecidos, y todo su pueblo está en ruinas, no quiero entrar en spoilers pero yo creo que la historia de este juego es decente, principalmente porque tiene un parecido y/o una conexión con la historia de James (Protagonista de SH 2), pero también porque explora el después de la Orden (Culto de SH), esta es una de las historia más dementes y retorcidas de la saga, ¿sacrificarías a un miembro de tu familia como ofrenda para un Dios?.

Gráficamente cumple con lo necesario de un juego de 7ma generación, nada brutal pero muy bien logrado, el diseño de los niveles, ambientación, escenarios, etc, me parecen muy bien construidos, en este juego se verá poco el lado oscuro de Silent Hill, pero las veces que nos adentramos a ese mundo transmitirá lo que esa parte de la cuidad debe lograr, algo que quiero resaltar muchísimo es el diseño de los monstruos, son espectaculares, principalmente los Bosses y la historia que hay detrás de ellos, espectacular.

Y por supuesto uno de los aspectos más grandes del juego, es el sountrack, obviamente por el regreso del gran Akira Yamaoka, cada pieza musical, cada nivel, cada batalla, es una delicia para los oídos, si un juego de horror logra combinar ambientación + soundtrack, es que ha hecho un buen trabajo, y este juego, como todo Silent Hill, lo hace.

Ahora voy por una de las partes que fue más criticada, la jugabilidad, Homecoming hizo un cambio muy grande en este aspecto a comparación de sus antecesores, la idea no estuvo mal, pero no lograron acertarla al 100%, el caso es que ahora puedes defenderte de los enemigos, algo que hace este cambio es perder un poco el miedo a las criaturas que te acechan, digo un poco, porque si lo juegas en el nivel de dificultad más alto (Cosa que debes, porque así se disfruta el verdadero Silent Hill), no puedes defenderte de todos, porque estas limitado en curas y munición, así que en muchas ocasiones solo te queda escapar de ellos y rogar que no te golpeen, esos momentos de persecución sí que generan tensión, más aun en lugares estrechos y sin saber dónde está la salida, un cambio que para mí quedó en el olvido, al menos estuvo mejor que en el Downpour.

[h1]Piramid Head y las enfermeras:[/h1]

Mucho se habló de este tema, que no tenía ningún sentido sus apariciones, que era fanservice, que el juego no tiene sentido, bla bla bla bla.
Nada en Silent Hill tiene sentido, eso es lo hermoso de esta saga, su infinita y confusa historia, no hablo del Homecoming o de uno en especial, hablo de toda la saga en conjunto, porque sí, todo está conectado, y el Homecoming aún más, este es uno de los juegos que tiene una gran conexión con los sucesos de la orden y lo que paso después de Alessa, explora aspectos del culto que no sabíamos y cierra de alguna manera esa etapa, eso explicaría en parte la aparición de las enfermeras, de alguna manera Alessa sigue ahí, aún no descansa en paz, y en cuando a Piramid head, ya había dicho la gran conexión que tiene el juego con SH 2 y lo parecido que son sus historias Alex y James comparten mucho, no hablo de Piramid Head, es lo de menos, hablo del pasado de cada uno, y algún personaje, la mayoría de gente habla de Piramid Head sin saber quién es él, muchos piensan que es solo James y están muy equivocados, no voy a hacer un párrafo de 10 líneas explicando quien es, pero para eso está internet, pero tienen que buscar blogs serios y con argumentos, pero acaba una pequeña explicación:

""Piramid Head es la representación de la culpabilidad, es aquel verdugo que te atormenta por un acto que has cometido e intentas olvidar""; bueno, en resumen es eso, Piramid Head tiene una historia muy grande que abarca muchas cosas, y para finalizar, ESTO ES SILENT HILL, no un juego en el cual te cuente una historia en la cual el príncipe rescata a la princesa y fin, esta saga se caracteriza por tener una trama grande, rica, confusa, si buscas un juego en el cual te cuente todo, este no es para ti, en Silent Hill no encontraras las respuestas a simple vista, hay que indagar, buscar, explorar, muchas veces retroceder y recordar sucesos anteriores, esto es lo rico de Silent Hill, si quieres algo simple, no juegues esto, pero si lo haces, no te inventes cosas sin sentido, porque en Silent Hill todo tiene un porqué.

[code]http://store.steampowered.com/app/19000/[/code]

P. D. Lamentablemente el juego ya no está disponible en steam, pero puedes comprar una key en G2A está a 10$, para lo ofrece el precio es más que suficiente. [spoiler]Ahora ya está, pero en ese tiempo no estaba.[/spoiler]

P. D.D. El port de PC es una bazofia, tuve que instalar 14.000 parches para no sé que, y aún así el juego me pasaba de 120fps a 40fps por momentos, es horroroso, lo que más miedo me dio de este videojuego es el terrible port que hicieron, así que ya sabes, si lo compras. debes lidiar con estos problemas.

[h1]Cualquier duda o consejo, coméntenlo así podemos debatir sobre el titulo o sobre qué les pareció el análisis, GRACIAS. [/h1]

+Boa atmosfera.
+Trilha sonora espetacular.
+boa ambientação
+Transições entre fogworld e Otherworld em tempo real.
+O combate do jogo em si. 
+Finais alternativos e bônus desbloqueáveis, aumentando o fator rejogabilidade.

-Falta de originalidade no design de alguns monstros, alguns reaproveitados de jogos anteriores.
-A inteligência artificial não é das melhores.
-Bugs, crashes e quedas de frame que nunca foram oficialmente consertados tornam o jogo quase injogável em alguns segmentos. 
-Falta de profundidade no enredo e nos personagens.
-Ausência dos achievements presentes nas versões de console.
-Loads longos demais.

Faktem niestety jest, że współcześni entuzjaści tego gatunku oczekują właśnie takiego podejścia i na nieszczęście dla koneserów, twórcy głównego nurtu przeważnie odpowiadają na to zapotrzebowanie, wydając kolejne, nic nie wnoszące gnioty. Z drugiej strony przy takim stanie rzeczy dużo bardziej docenia się ambitne i głębokie produkcje, zarówno w kinie, jak też w branży interaktywnej rozrywki. Seria ""Silent Hill"" mimo upływu lat wciąż jest po tej dobrej, konserwatywnej stronie growych horrorów. Co takiego w niej jest, że pomimo faktu, iż nie straszy nas tanimi chwytami i tak sprawia, że gracz czuje się niepewnie podczas zabawy? Przede wszystkim duszna i mroczna atmosfera, odpowiednie budowanie klimatu grozy, przerażająca stylistyka i oprawa oraz rozsądne wykorzystywanie najlepszych schematów tego gatunku. ""Homecoming"" to swego rodzaju hołd w stronę pierwszych trzech części serii, jak również odrobina innowacji i nieco inne, zamerykanizowane podejście do pierwotnego konceptu. Na wstępie pragnę zaznaczyć, że ta recenzja będzie nieco inna niż wszystkie. Nie będę tutaj dokładnie omawiał pojedynczych aspektów gry, tak jak to zwykle robię w moich pracach, lecz zajmę się głębszą analizą całokształtu i skonfrontuje ze sobą dwie skrajne opinie odnośnie tej produkcji.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=482785018
""Silent Hill"" od zawsze dzielił graczy na dwie grupy. Jedni zakochali się w niesamowitym klimacie, chorych projektach poziomów i przeciwników oraz w grozie i poczuciu bezradności, które pośrednio wynikajało z topornych mechanizmów rozgrywki. Drudzy zaś zostali odrzuceni przez wspomnianą wcześniej toporną mechanikę, przeciętną jakość oprawy graficznej czy też nieprzyjazne dla niedzielnego użytkownika interfejs i sterowanie. ""Homecoming"" podzielił graczy po raz kolejny, ale tym razem ofiarami padli fani serii, którzy znienawidzili Double Helix Games za zbyt radykalne zmiany stylu i atmosfery. Zamiast klasycznych, czysto japońskich klimatów dostajemy amerykański obraz, któremu bliżej do filmowej sagi niż do poprzednich gier Japończyków. Druga grupa przyjęła tę produkcję o wiele cieplej i uznała ją za powiew świeżości i miłą odskocznie.
Ja zaliczam się do grupy zwolenników tej części i pod względem klimatu stawiam ją na równi z ""Silent Hill 3"".

Tyle jeśli chodzi o wprowadzenie. Jak widać kontrowersji i skrajnych opinii wokół tej gry i całej serii jest naprawdę sporo. Śmiało można powiedzieć, że niemal każdy element ma swoich zwolenników i przeciwników. Weźmy na przykład toporną mechanikę rozgrywki. W niemalże każdej grze byłaby to wada i na tym opinia by się skończyła. Jednak w ""Homecoming"" sprawa jest nieco bardziej skomplikowana. Toporne i trudne sterowanie z jednej strony odstrasza niedzielnych graczy, a z drugiej jest jedną ze składowych poczucia bezradności i strachu. Fakt, że nie posiadamy pełnej kontroli nad ruchami bohatera, a zdolności motoryczne naszej postaci są mocno ograniczone, chaotyczne i niezdarne, sprawia, że mamy wrażenie kierowania realistycznie wykreowaną osobowością, która nie potrafi posługiwać się bronią. To nie tylko rewelacyjnie buduje klimat, ale przy okazji sprawia, że gra nabiera poważnych barw. Gdyby twórcy nagle urozmaicili mechanikę rozgrywki, sprawiając by stała się bardziej przejrzysta i dynamiczna, mogliby przypadkiem zabić część klimatu i przy okazji gra straciłaby jeden ze swoich najważniejszych elementów. Jak widać po głębszym przemyśleniu całej sprawy, spisywanie tych mechanizmów na straty tylko dlatego, że są toporne jest zupełnie bez sensu.

Z oprawą jest podobny problem. Mamy 2009 rok i nagle na światło dzienne wychodzi gra, która wygląda jakby była opóźniona o kilka ładnych lat. Pomimo, że stylistyka jest wręcz rewelacyjna to jakość tekstur pozostawia bardzo dużo do życzenia. Tak samo sprawa ma się, z szeroko pojętym dźwiękiem. Muzyka przygrywająca nam podczas rozgrywki również brzmi wybornie, ale jej ogólny wydźwięk jest dosyć nietypowy. Wydaje się ona nieczysta, tłumiona złą akustyką czy nawet wręcz popsuta. Gdy zbierzemy jednak razem obie składowe oprawy i przyrównamy je do mechaniki rozgrywki, otrzymamy całkiem ciekawą kombinację. Z jednej strony toporny gameplay, z drugiej pozornie niskiej jakości strona techniczna. Z jakiegoś powodu to wszystko ze sobą współgra i nie odbiera się tego jako coś negatywnego. Do czego zmierzam. Przede wszystkim nie zamierzam tutaj bronić Konami, ani Double Helix Games. Gra może jest niedopracowana i patrząc surowym okiem momentami wygląda słabo. Poza tym nie jestem pewien czy to zamierzony zabieg czy po prostu niesamowity kunszt deweloperów, zdolnych zamaskować i załagodzić tak wiele niedogodności. Chcę jednak zaznaczyć, że dla mnie, w tym wypadku nie są to jednak wady. Wszechobecny nieporządek pasuje do siebie idealnie i tworzy coś niezwykle fascynującego. Niepokojące, niepewne widowisko, przy którym nie wiemy czego możemy się spodziewać. W pewnym sensie wady stają się największymi zaletami. Bo zastanówmy się przez chwilę, czy jakby udoskonalić mechanikę rozgrywki i poprawić jakość oprawy, ""Silent Hill"" byłby wciąż tą samą grą? Może i byłby lepszy, ale z pewnością nie miałby już tego klimatu.

Na koniec muszę jeszcze wspomnieć o fabule, zrobię to jednak bardzo powierzchownie i najkrócej jak tylko się da, tak, żeby nie psuć nikomu wrażeń z rozgrywki. Jest ona intrygująca, pełna zaskakujących zwrotów akcji i dosyć sensownie napisana. Jednym słowem jest po prostu dobra i wciąga gracza bardzo ciekawym scenariuszem.

[b]P.S.

Inną sprawą jest dosyć kiepski port PC(Steam), o którym mimo wszystko muszę wspomnieć. Gra została przeniesiona bardzo niechlujnie i zarówno blokada 30 klatek na sekundę, jak też sporadyczne przycięcia dają się we znaki. Tego nie da już interpretować na kilka sposobów, bo jest to po prostu byle jaka robota. Można to jakoś wytrzymać i przede wszystkim warto, bo gra jest czymś nietypowym i wyjątkowym.[/b]",

Les -:

- Pas beau (moins que le 3 sur PS2, moins soigné, etc.).
- Doublages et musiques sympa sans plus.
- Histoire ... (sans spoiler) on aime ou on aime pas (j'aime pas).
- La fin OVNI obtenable dès la première partie et SANS BONUS. Vous pouvez très bien l'obtenir par mégarde en jouant le jeu normalement (ce n'est plus une fin BONUS a ce niveau là).
- Beaucoup plus bourrin (fait une grande partie du jeu, surtout la fin, avec le couteau, car rapide, et facilement utilisable).
- Les buuuuuuuuugs (quelques plantage du son, bug manette, etc.).


Les +:
- Certains design des monstres.
- Certaines scènes un peu choquante (surtout à la fin).
- Quelques bonus (costumes, etc.).

Donc, pour moi le jeu vaudrait 10/20, vraiment moyen, à tester à bas prix.

It didn’t bother me that this SH game was more action oriented than previous installments but combat itself was rather frustrating. It felt awkward and slow. I died so many times until I realized that using a knife (the very first weapon) was the way to against most of the enemies. By the end of the game fighting was no longer a challenge. I had so many med kits and health drinks, I didn’t know what to do with them. 

[b]Save Points. [/b]
There are not that many. Since you die rather often early in the game and game crashes regularly (at least in my experience) replaying the same area over and over again becomes very annoying quickly. 

[b]Loading time. [/b]
It takes a WHILE to load a new area or a save game (I played it on i7-5820K / 16GB / GTX970). Also, sometimes game just freezes for a few seconds.

[h1]The Ugly[/h1]
[b]Glitches[/b]
There are plenty. To list a few:
[list]
[*]Controls are unresponsive during button mashing sequences. 
[*]You cannot damage monsters. Only happened once, I wasted all my ammo and died a few times. It was fixed after I restarted the game. 
[*]Sound sometimes is coming out of only one speaker and a couple of times audio was out of sync during cut-scenes. 
[*]Many people reported glitches with certain puzzles all thought I haven’t experienced any. 
[/list]
[b]Crashes [/b]
It must have crashed at least 25-30 time during a single playthrough. There was no particular pattern. Sometimes it crashes on startup (Often 2-3 times in a row. If you keep restarting it will launch eventually). Sometimes mid game, sometimes during cut-scenes, sometimes during a loading sequence. Very late in the game it crashed 8 times in a row in the same exact spot. This is when I was ready to give up. I’m glad it didn’t crash 9 times in a row otherwise I would never be able to finish the game :(
None of the solutions I found online helped me (although, I think lowering graphic settings does help in some cases). I tried playing on 2 different PCs, on Win7 and on Win10.

I am glad I finished the game. I enjoyed parts of it but overall it was a very frustrating experience because how bad this port is. In the end it was a sigh of relief rather than satisfaction from a completed game.

[b]Crashes [/b]
It must have crashed at least 25-30 time during a single playthrough. There was no particular pattern. Sometimes it crashes on startup (Often 2-3 times in a row. If you keep restarting it will launch eventually). Sometimes mid game, sometimes during cut-scenes, sometimes during a loading sequence. Very late in the game it crashed 8 times in a row in the same exact spot. This is when I was ready to give up. I’m glad it didn’t crash 9 times in a row otherwise I would never be able to finish the game :(
None of the solutions I found online helped me (although, I think lowering graphic settings does help in some cases). I tried playing on 2 different PCs, on Win7 and on Win10.

I am glad I finished the game. I enjoyed parts of it but overall it was a very frustrating experience because how bad this port is. In the end it was a sigh of relief rather than satisfaction from a completed game. 

[b]If you are a fan of Silent Hill franchise or horror games in general this game is worth playing but you will be better off playing it on a console. [/b]

I originally bought this title as part of a sale in 2011.  As a huge fan of the first 3 silent titles I had high hopes despite mixed reviews.  However, I immediately regretted my decision. The port was so buggy I was unable to progress more than a few minutes into the game.  This game sat dormant within my library for 5 years with only 6 minutes of play until Steam’s revised return policy gave me a chance to right my mistake.  Sadly, steam did not grant my refund, 5 years is a long time, so half hoping to work myself into tizzy I reinstalled.  Well it worked….kind of.  Whether the result of a patch or my new hardware I was able to complete the game, though at times wised I hadn’t.

Silent hill homecoming features the series trademark moody, misty, and mysterious environments.  The game play is built around over the shoulder 3rd person combat, typical fetch quest, puzzles, and even a few undercooked metroidvainia style elements.  However, depth clearly wasn’t a design driver.  The fetch quests are simple, and due to relatively barren environments it doesn’t take to long to figure out what goes to what.  Next, Homecoming is missing legacy features like combine item, and inventory item examination thus removing further depth from this installment of the franchise.  But don’t despair, with the exception of a few mid game riddles, Homecoming treats you to puzzles like that slide puzzle at your dentist office or there own R rated version of the baby shape game.

The combat system is almost a bright spot.  The Combat utilizes several melee weapon classes and small arms featuring a relatively linear progression in reach and damage.  While the ranged combat is what you might expect from a 3rd person shooter, the melee combat is more developed than any previous SH title.  Players can dodge attacks, counter, block, heavy attack, execute finishers, and even combo in game.  Sounds pretty sweet right, and it would be if it wasn’t for your ability to crit-lock nearly all enemies, broken quick time events, and unfriendly camera angles.  Your inventory is also oddly limited.  For despite Alex’s ability to carry a knife, pipe, axe, shotgun, pistol, and rifle your character can’t seem to find more than a handful of space for ammo, making the survival horror staple of stockpiling resources a no go.

One thing I did like was Homecomings story and voice work.  The campaigns premise while unoriginal just works, and late game plot reveals do a great job making sense of memory flashes and found tokens.  In addition I found myself constantly guessing at who Alex is.  Is he crazy, already dead, or a resident of otherworld like Lisa from first Silent Hill.  Hell, for half the game I was pretty sure Alex was an imaginary friend.  Despite these great story elements Homecoming features some terribly developed characters, none of whom seem to find perpetual mist, infrastructure ending sink holes, or an army of other worldly demons all that odd.  While the game cleans this up late game in a Shamalan style twist, it does so at the cost of creating plot holes you could drive a bus through.

Graphically the game might be best described a barren, even for a port.  A lot of environmental objects are use repeatedly but sparingly.  The textures also are so underwhelming you might not realize Alex’s jacket is desert-camo and not desert tan.  The character models and monsters however are greatly detailed and feel a bit out of place in the low poly count world.

In terms of replay value Silent Hill Homecoming features 4 different endings based on three critical decision events distributed evenly throughout the campaign.  Since we got one ending, and one bonus costume out of our 11 hour campaign pass we’re confident there is a lot of game play left for the masochist that needs to see it all, but most of you should just Youtube them instead.  With the exception maybe of running about town bashing monsters wondering what could have been we can’t suggest buying.

Worst of all the game has a tendency to crash and at a minimum freezes for sometimes 30seconds at a time making it one of the least stable games in my collection.  We try to keep our reviews free of outrage.  Others have done it first and better, but even I found it difficult to maintain an objective tone while evaluating this title.  We suggest you don’t buy at any price point.  As always I hope this review has informed your purchase. Be well.

I'm speaking about this nightmarish shameful port and it's nightmarish shameful graphics, hitboxes, lasting fps losses, unresponsive commands, light bugs, animation bugs, dodge bugs... I litterally can't play for more than 15 minutes in a row wether because the game will crash sooner or later wether for my nerves health due to progressive fps loss. Looks like there are memory leaks all over the place causing as many lags, freezes and crashes.

Excellent atmosphere, very good story, could have been a great Silent Hill except for the fact that nearly everything is so blatantly ripped wether from the movie wether from previous games. Oh, and Piramidehead cameos are a very sad joke. Except the final one in my opinion. Too bad everything else is, mark my word, a real shame. Hadn't saw this kind of bugs in light and animations since the darkest days of the first playstation at least, no joking.

Left alone this game most likely did everything that's listed in the ""No twinkie database"". For those who do not heard of this : it's a list of all worst choices in game design that can be made. My worst pick is undoubtedly here seeing a M14 on the ground from a fallen enemy and not being able to take it nor the ammos. Two times. And this magnum revolver clearly visible at the belt of a dead cop. And this grinder saw on a dead enemy. And so many others...

Funnily enough it's all in all a good, maybe even very good Silent Hill. Everything is here, symbolic, cult, psychology, nightmarish universe, all bathed in a deep feeling of loss and wandering.
But it's an atrocious game where nearly everyhting feel broken. Usually it's the opposite in regard of a big franchise where a game is still a good game in itself but disappointing compared to what fans of previous episodes wanted. Not this time. Shame.

I feel completely ripped even for 5€. Should have asked for a refund while I still could. I still struggled to finish the game because I wanted the end of the story but God what kind of a martyrdom it was.",

[i] Silent Hill Homecoming è un gioco survival horror con la possibilità di difesa e combattimento dei nemici.
In se, il gioco offre un'ambientazione particolare, che è in grado di mettere ansia e paura fin dai primi momenti del gioco. 

Ma sotto questo grande incubo, purtroppo si nasconde qualcosa di molto più spaventoso, che ahimè, è stato l'elemento tanto negativo da non farmi consigliare questo gioco.
I fattori positivi sono ben pochi:

[*]  Trama strutturata.
[*]  Ottima ambientazione di gioco.
[*]  Nemici spaventosi e ben fatti.
[*]  Difficoltà adeguata con l'avanzare del gioco.
[*]  Enigmi e rompicapo. 

La lista termina qua.

Purtroppo questo capitolo di Silent Hill, presenta innumerevoli bug per la versione pc, perché il porting effettuato è a dir poco scandaloso.
Finirlo è stato forse uno degli incubi peggiori della mia vita, trovarsi d'innanzi scene di lag improvviso, boss battle buggate che non permettevano di liberarsi dalla presa di nemici, crash senza una sequenza logica, caricamenti che si cronometravano a MINUTI e tante altre cose da voler più volte disinstallare il gioco e chiuderla qua. 
Forse la pazienza o la pazzia, mi hanno permesso di terminare questa storia. 
Meccaniche di gameplay basilari, schiva, attacca. Poche volte è concessa la fuga, perché la maggior parte dei combattimenti sono OBBLIGATORI da compiere, poiché se in qualche modo vengono evitati, ci porteranno d'innanzi ad uno sbarramento da parte dei nemici.
In poche parole, se si schiva la battaglia e si scappa aprendo una porta, (esatto i nemici non hanno capacità nel girare le maniglie) e per disgrazia bisogna tornare in quel punto, troveremo i nostri affezionatissimi ad aspettarci allegramente d'innanzi al passaggio, pronti per attaccare e portarci quasi sempre al game over.
La versione di steam dice che la lingua italiana è inesistente, mentre all'avvio del gioco intravediamo già menù e sottotitoli in italiano.
Ma come sempre, noi dobbiamo essere discriminati, appunto, nella versione italiana, non ci è concesso di cambiare la grafica, risoluzione, comandi del Joypad. 
E per risolvere questo problema, bisogna applicare una serie di eventi molto fastidiosi per bug che nel 2016 non dovrebbero minimamente esistere. 
Il sistema di mappa che in tutti i Silent Hill è L'EMBLEMA per trovare la strada, è stato trasferito in una maniera assurda, in poche parole con una risoluzione 1920x1080 avremmo la possibilità di vedere solo ¼ di mappa, giusto per rendere ancor più imbarazzante il lavoro maledetto che hanno fatto.
In poche parole questo capitolo di SH mi ha soddisfatto in parte, ho amato molto la sfida posta da parte dei boss battle, ma odiato profondamente chi ha permesso di far uscire questo porting fatto decisamente male e a metà. 
Se volete giocarlo, fatelo con la versione console, che da come dicono le voci, pare sia fatto decisamente 1000 volte meglio. [/i]",

I got it for $9.99 on sale, and I feel like a heel for allowing myself to be tempted even at that price. For $9.99 I recieved nothing but amazing levels of frustration and anger. 

Why?

1. This ""game"" crashes continuously. It often crashes on start up - at the moment that it says Konami on the screen - before it is even remotely possible for there to be any legitimate reason for it to crash. It often crashes right after major boss fights, causing them to be refought. It crashes on cut scenes. Crash. Crash. Crash. Crash. Crash. Crash. Crash. Crash. Crash. Crash. Crash. Crash. Crash. 

2. Save points - These are so rare as to be non-existent. I know that ""survival horror"" is supposed to be ""hard."" I have played plenty of survival horror games. This is not hard. This is stupid. My play time consists of hours of playing the same parts and skipping the same cut scenes over and over and over because of save point placement being insanely stupid and rare. Save points after boss fights? Nope. Dieing 3 minutes after a boss fight and then having to fight the boss again was common. Doing the same thing over and over and over and over because the save points were randomly placed by idiots is not fun. 

3. Combat is constant and ridiculously difficult. I play shooters, hack and slash, RTS, survival - a bit of everything - and NO GAME I have EVER played made combat such a chore. 90% of the time, success was luck. Try to dodge? Nope. Try to stun? Nope. I ended up doing more pointless button mashing in this game - and still, success always came down to just luck. In the less than 12 hours I played this game I must have died 80 times - which is almost half as many times as the game crashed. This does not make a game ""scary."" It makes it rage inducing crap. 

I hate this game with a passion. I would vow to quit playing it, then come back and try again. I really gave it way more time than it deserved, but in the end, I quit half way through and wouldn't play it again for money. This was the least pleasant, least fun, least playable piece of crap I have ever wasted my time with.

2. Save points - These are so rare as to be non-existent. I know that ""survival horror"" is supposed to be ""hard."" I have played plenty of survival horror games. This is not hard. This is stupid. My play time consists of hours of playing the same parts and skipping the same cut scenes over and over and over because of save point placement being insanely stupid and rare. Save points after boss fights? Nope. Dieing 3 minutes after a boss fight and then having to fight the boss again was common. Doing the same thing over and over and over and over because the save points were randomly placed by idiots is not fun. 

3. Combat is constant and ridiculously difficult. I play shooters, hack and slash, RTS, survival - a bit of everything - and NO GAME I have EVER played made combat such a chore. 90% of the time, success was luck. Try to dodge? Nope. Try to stun? Nope. I ended up doing more pointless button mashing in this game - and still, success always came down to just luck. In the less than 12 hours I played this game I must have died 80 times - which is almost half as many times as the game crashed. This does not make a game ""scary."" It makes it rage inducing crap. 

I hate this game with a passion. I would vow to quit playing it, then come back and try again. I really gave it way more time than it deserved, but in the end, I quit half way through and wouldn't play it again for money. This was the least pleasant, least fun, least playable piece of crap I have ever wasted my time with. 

Consider yourself warned."

1. It has 30 FPS!
My responce: This was before 60FPS was commonly accepted to be put to use as far as I know. This was made in 2008, which is 7 years ago, unlike games like Batman: Arkham Knight, where all of the other games were 60FPS and didn't have a lock. I played it and had no problems with it, unlike with most Shooters and Action games on the market. Horror games are meant to be slow, not fast like those types of games I mentioned earlier. If you really have a big deal, just look it up on the internet and I am sure you can find a solution.

2. It's way too expensive! How is a game from 2008 $39.99!
My responce: Look at the publisher who made this. The last game they made was from 2011. I do know that the developer did make a game less than a year ago, but the publishers do control the price of the game for the most part. I do agree that this game should have a price drop, but there is something we can look forward to: Sales. A while back, this game rarely went on sale, but within the past year, it has gone on sale twice and it uually goes down to $9.99. That is the price I recommend getting it on Steam. If you don't want to wait long (For example it didn't go on sale for more than a year before), then buy it on G2A. As of right now, the prices are under $9.99.

3. The controls are awful and a mess!
My responce: The controls aren't bad at all. They are the same as before with WASD. How are the controls bad? That is what confuses me with this.

My responce: Look at the publisher who made this. The last game they made was from 2011. I do know that the developer did make a game less than a year ago, but the publishers do control the price of the game for the most part. I do agree that this game should have a price drop, but there is something we can look forward to: Sales. A while back, this game rarely went on sale, but within the past year, it has gone on sale twice and it uually goes down to $9.99. That is the price I recommend getting it on Steam. If you don't want to wait long (For example it didn't go on sale for more than a year before), then buy it on G2A. As of right now, the prices are under $9.99.

3. The controls are awful and a mess!
My responce: The controls aren't bad at all. They are the same as before with WASD. How are the controls bad? That is what confuses me with this.

So hopefully, these reviews won't make you shy away from this game."

Gameplay : Silent hill homecomig e un survival horror psicologico in terza persona. Il gioco ruota sulla soluzione di enigmi e il combattimento. Le munizioni e armi da fuoco scarseggiano , quindi dovremo ripiegare sulle abilità di combattimento corpo a corpo.  Attaco leggero e veloce , oppure potente e lento. ci sarà la possibilità di schivare i colpi come un pugile. Seppur il sistema di combattimento sembra credibile e ottimo , al lungo andare ci si accorge che risulta impreciso e macchinoso , per un sistema non preciso di auto lock dei nemici e la latenza dei controlli.

Trama : Siamo alex un soldato reduce di guerra , che ritornato a casa , viene a sapere che che quasi tutta la popolazione e sparita nell nulla. Cercado la verità e famigliari , dovrete scoprire le verità scomode di silent hill . 

Grafica e Ottimizzazione: il compato tecnico e grafico e altalenante. Modelli dei personaggi ben modellatti , affiancati a modelli di bassa qualità . Ottimo desing mostri e ambientazioni . Ottima l'ulliminazione e la nebbia che creano la giusta atmosfera! 
In quanto a ottimizzazione ci troviamo davanti a un pessimo porting da console.

Problemi:
-Crash improvvisi su alcuni sistemi 
-Il gioco crasha con Alt+Tab ↹ in fullscreen
-Risoluzioni superiori al fullhd da problemi di visibilità alla mappa e ogetti.
-60 fps non sono solidi , anche forzando il triplo buffering , o con una cpu potente in singolo core.
-Il menu principale in italiano e rotto, mancano delle opzioni.
-Mancano le icone del controller del xbox

I problemi elencati sono risolvibili , a patto di dover installare a mano ogni fix , vi lascio il  link:
https://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Silent_Hill:_Homecoming

Oppure ho creato una cartella con tutti i fix già presenti , basta copiare la cartella del gioco e sovrscivere i file:

Conclusioni: E uno dei migliori survival horror psicologico. Problemi a parte . e migliore di tanti indie che si trovano su steam.

La busqueda de su familia  guiará sus pasos hasta el vecino pueblo de Silent Hill, al que desde niños tenian prohibido acercarse y sobre el que se rumorea pesa una maldición.

Quinto juego de las saga que cuenta con entusiastas y detractores a partes iguales, en mi caso me encanta y me desespera al mismo tiempo y es que es dificil saber si recomendar este juego o no porque sus puntos fuertes brillan y sus puntos flojos pueden estropear la experiencia.

entre sus puntos fuertes que no son pocos, cabría destacar la historia: Un relato de horror muy bien construido, siendo intrincado pero no tedioso y bien desarrollado y dosificado a lo largo del juego, vamos que es un juego que cuando lo juegas una segunda vez te quedas con muchos mas detalles del entorno y que forman parte del transfondo de la trama y que antes se podrían haber pasado por alto. Otra de sus virtudes es el diseño tanto de entornos como de personajes, tiene algunos de los enemigos mas chulos que he visto en un survival horror, de los que dan mal rollo de verdad y además cargados de simbolismo como es habitual en la saga, y tanto la ambientación como la musica ayudan a crear una muy buena experiencia  de las que te hacen pasar un mal rato.

Pero no todo es bueno en este juego, pues en algo tan esencial como la jugabilidad es donde está su mayor defecto. Lo primero que hay que decir es que se trata de un port de consola y no el mejor hecho precisamente, ni siquiera los botones que el juego indica para interactuar con puertas, interruptores, liberarte de agarres enemigos, etc... se corresponden con los botones del mando de microsoft (lo cual es raro teniendo en cuenta que este juego tiene una versión en xbox) lo que equivale a que un agarre del enemigo suponga una muerte casi segura, así que todo el sistema de combate se ve perjudicado resultando en esquivas que no funcionan, golpes que hacen retroceder a los enemigos fuera de tu rango y te dejan con el culo al aire y otras perlas del estilo. Por si eso no fuera suficiente hay momentos en los que el juego tiene unos picos de dificultad totalmente absurdos y que pueden llegar a desesperar y que requieren de gran perseverancia y de aprender que cualquier enemigo puede hacerte morder el polvo, mas de 2 juntos es un suicidio, huir siempre que sea posible es la mejor opción y afrontar solo los combates que no se puedan evitar, aunque quizá esa fuera la idea desde el principio y no abrirse paso a golpes de hacha. Los que seguro no se pueden evitar son los jefes finales, que aunque son muy chulos son unos bastardos que te harán la vida imposible.

Pese a que el juego tiene ya unos añitos se mantiene bastante fresco y pese a sus enormes problemas vale la pena revisitarlo.

This is a throwback game to survival horror with exploration at its heart.  The world thats made is pretty much free roam to be explored with items to find making it feel a bit like RE1.  When this was released everyone hated it, its competition was Dead Space so thats a tough one to go against without bringing the A game.  This game though does what few games do anymore which is exploration in a world of survival horror, the monsters while not diverse fit the atmosphere including a boss right out of Human Centipede named Asphyxia derived from greek meaning without heartbeat.

Anyone who hated the movie, will hate this game.  Story is similar but vastly different in its approach making it fresh for fans who saw the movie a billion times.  Those who hated the movie should check it out again now to see what a top movie studio can bring to blood guts and gore that they really havent done since if they want something to appreciate.   For survival horror fans who couldnt stomach this game at release its the modern day now so all we get are walking simulators with spooky stuffs.

This game is horrific to look at visually, in all the wrong ways which somehow makes this game even creepier.  Released for Xbox 360 and PS3 using the Havok Engine, which brought us everything from Skyrim to Oblivion and Dark Souls.  Silent Hill comes off looking like some abomination mix of PS2 textures, with PS3 character models for some characters while others are PS2 looking or even PS1 with the fidelity of their textures.  This mashup of quality lends itself actually to Silent Hill, where something is always a bit off.  Something always lurking below the surface, in a good way this bad quality in any other game actually adds to its charm here of being an evil demonic messed up interdimensional crossover crazy kinda world.  

The lighting however is pure genius, some of the best ever in gaming for this genre.  The world isnt BLACK like other games to add a fake fear factor.  For many games that is their gimmick a one trick pony of wondering whats outside the dark.  Its a cheap gimmick, and people make that world, they design it for atmosphere and if we cant see it or feel the atmosphere their just wasting their time and ours.  In this game its dim everywhere just right to get a feeling for the world or place you are in, there is a flashlight to further light up areas since its so dim.  Dim means we can see the world its amazing a work of art that way in survival horror design where many games opt to just make everything black.

The gameplay is brutal, playing it on normal isnt bad at all, playing it on hard is doable as well.  Dodge is almost broken but works under very very precise conditions relying on the skill of the player to memorize the moves of a given boss to anticipate them and react.  On hard with bad controls every boss can still be beat with melee.  The controls are as horrific as everything else, there isnt much if any of a tutorial so its just wing it and see what works with different weapons.  

Bugs, well this game has em all, from being version 1.0 we bring you random crashes and bugs galore.  The game will freeze erratically at times then magically unfreeze.  Oddly many of these glitches somehow also add to how the game infects your computer and its own engine.  The world of silent hill and how it wants to ruin everything can not be contained!  None of these are gamebreaking, there are save spots so if it crashes no big loss.  

Bridgetips:
1.  Turn out the lights, play at night, say goodbye to the real world and hello to Silent Hill.
2.  Use the knife for almost everything.   The combo to use is Fast-Fast-Fast-Heavy
3.  Enemies in the streets respawn, run by them when possible.
4.  After fighting Curtis who has a buzz saw, go back in Curtis's room and get the 301 key on the wall, when leaving before the 1st gate get your weapons back in room 301.
5.  Use doorways to your advantage many enemies cant get through them or only one can get through at a time.
6.  Use the environment like desks and tables to heavy stab across out of range of enemies.

Earlier it was mentioned this game was horrifying in the real world.   This game can wreck the reputations of even the most high tech and largest corporations in the world, Amazon.  It would be correct to understand that this game is made by Amazon who owns Double Helix game studios.  Even scarier is currently if trying to visit the double helix website, all browsers will block you saying its an unsafe sites.  Nothing is safe from the horrors of this game, while this game is for sale on steam, its interesting to note that Amazon does NOT sell this game on PC as of this writing.  The limits of Silent Hill know no boundaries oozing into our world infecting all this game touches.  Even scarier is wanting the game fixed calling a contact at Amazon who owns Double Helix only to find out noone has the phone number to the company they own.  Who knows what nightmares will be unleashed if and when that phone number is found, but most likely problem with game is it was literally made for XP, so they gotta update it, gotta do something and its high time they fix it or at least were made aware we care enough for them to fix it, so lets hope we now get our update!  

More fun trivia?  
Silent Hill is based on a real place, hell on earth, a town called Centralia in Pennsylvania.  A place of absolute evil that stinks of the bowels of hades with the burning smell of sulfur.  A hell burns underneath this town from an underground coal mine fire that is impossible to put out so it just burns forever.  A town covered in ash with columns of smoke rising randomly into the sky blacking out the sun on the brightest day.  

The roads missing in the game thats legit, fun fact in Centralia there is only one road in and out.  The government  tried to build a highway through the city then the day that highway opened, a giant hole opened swallowing it up.  The town is so evil, the government built the highway around the entire town keeping the town cut off.  The town has few residents many part of a singular religion which has some unique elements to say the least.  

Graveyards are actually full of children.  Its rumored that locals had deformed children due to the toxic byproducts of the fire.  These locals were too kind to kill their children, so they would put the children in the old mine shafts left to themselves eating eachother or the scraps the out of work mine town could afford, who knows if their still there or what tourists they feed on who make the mistake of making a pit stop.  

These stories also gave rise to the Hills Have Eyes movies, and inspired Rob Zombie for the underground parts of Devils Rejects.  At each entrance to the town are shrines to the Virgin Mary with candles, flowers all kinds of stuff, who lights all those candles?  The town next door has a HUGE what must be 6 or 7 story tall statue of some christian preacher guy with his hand outstretched in a stopping posture towards the town of Centralia as if keeping the evil away.  The whole area is suspect of supernatural something or other, yet most who go there trying to survive the night lose their minds or never live to tell the true tale of what lies within the dark heart of Centralia.","This game is spooky and terrifying more than just whats in the game.

Allora questo è l'unico Silent Hill che abbiamo su Steam purtroppo, visto che gli altri Silent Hill sono un capolavoro e sono molto più belli di questo capitolo, anche se questo capitolo ha un interessante storia e SOTTOLINEO che non ha nulla a che fare con la storia di Silent Hill degli altri capitoli.
Il gioco soffre di molti problemi purtroppo i FPS sono bloccati a 30 e non salgono, la grafica sembra di un gioco della PS2 (anche se io non giudico un libro dalla copertina) ma a me onestamente piace, non so perchè il gioco si freeza per 20-30 secondi senza motivo, c'è un bug molto grave nel capitolo dell'Hotel in cui se muori, il gioco si bugga e bisogna fare l'intero gioco di nuovo, non ha opzioni grafiche.
La storia come ho detto sopra è molto interessante, ma non è spettacolare come gli altri capitoli precedenti, ma devo ammettere che in questo capitolo, il design dei mostri sono davvero molto belli sopratutto i Boss.
Che dire a me questo capitolo è piaciuto ma non come gli altri capitoli precedenti.

Pro:

+ Silent Hill
+ Trama interessante
+ Design Mostri/Boss

Con:

- Bugs 
- 30 FPS Lock

Do not take seriously my review, because I'm a fan of Silent Hill and then give a positive review to the game although it has many problems.
Then this is the only Silent Hill that we have on Steam unfortunately, since the other Silent Hill is a masterpiece and are much nicer in this chapter, although this chapter has an interesting history and stressed that has nothing to do with the story of Silent Hill the other chapters.
The game suffers from many problems, unfortunately, are locked at 30 FPS and not go up, the graphics seem a PS2 game (though I do not judge a book by its cover) but I honestly like it, do not know why the game is to Freez 20-30 seconds for no reason, there is a very serious bug in the chapter of the Hotel where if you die, the game bug and you have to do the whole game again, no graphics options.
The story as I said above is very interesting, but not spectacular like other previous chapters, but I must admit that in this chapter, the design of the monsters are really quite beautiful especially the Boss.
What about me I liked this chapter, but not like the other chapters.

Pro:

+ Silent Hill

Péssimo port o game possui travamentos contantes, trava no inicio, nas telas de loading. As vezes o som seja ambiente ou de falas fica dessincronizado. Os botões são misturados, no game a quicktime event, nele aparece o botão na tela para executar a ação mas o botão que aparece na tela é diferente do que realmente é para ser apertado, então você morre. 

O mapa fica cortado no meio, não aparece totalmente na tela, já falei que trava muito?

O jogo é bom,porem ele vai muito para o lado da ação e se esquece do lado do terror e isso faz ele ser  menos admirado em relação aos seus antecessores.Outro ponto que deixa Silent Hill Homecoming para traz é sua historia,ela em si não é ruim mais poderia ser melhor aproveitada e seu plot twist é bem ""bocó"".se você ignorar esse 2 pontos e alguns bugs SH Homecoming pode ser considerado um bom jogo.
Como todo jogo da franquia Silent Hill sua trilha sonora continua excelente,apesar do jogo ser de 2008 seu gráfico é muito bom.outro fator que é muito positivo para o jogo são seus monstros,cada um deles tem um significado e uma representação na historia e é muito legal ver que mesmo com o passar dos anos a konami continuou com o mesmo esmero em relação a isso.
recomendo muito Silent Hill Homecoming tanto para novos fans da serie pois não é um jogo com tanto terror quanto aos que já jogarão seus antecessores pois é uma boa chance de revisitar esse ambiente tão agradável que é silent hill <3",

Já havia jogado ele cinco anos atrás, e resolvi comprar porque estava na promoção. A questão é: lembro que na época tive alguns problemas com o jogo (demora ao carregar, o jogo fecha às vezes repentinamente ou trava). Mas mesmo assim, comprei porque queria lembrar de como era, e aqueles pontos negativos não me inibiram de zerar.

Joguei por algumas horas, quase chegando ao final, mas então veio a luta com o penúltimo boss que tirou toda a minha paciência (e olha que em relação a Silent Hill, tenho bastante). Alex demora para responder os comandos e não consegue livrar-se do monstro (mesmo ao clicar freneticamente, não dá resultado). Nem vou comentar sobre o áudio, que parece sair só da direita, além da versão da Steam aparenta estar mais bugada (como assim?).

Entretanto, o jogo não é totalmente ruim. A trilha sonora é linda, Akira Yamaoka e Mary Elizabeth não deixaram a desejar (a música do menu é a melhor). A história é muito boa e os finais também. O clima da cidade realmente lembra os anteriores, os monstros são até bem feitos e os puzzles são relativamente simples e a história não é a mais complexa e profunda que tem nos jogos anteriores, mas no geral é ok. Apesar disso tudo, estaria sendo injusta caso recomendasse, já que nem todo mundo conhece SH e talvez se começasse com esse ficaria desanimado de jogar os outros. Nota: 6.5/10",
17146182,brazilian,2015.06.21 00:29,❌,✅,0.5,0,"Jogo de ótimo potencial, mas tem umas coisas totalmente broxantes. O roteiro é bom, a música é boa, o ambiente é bom, o gráfico é aceitavel, mas a jogabilidade é péssima. O jogo chega a criar um clima pesado (o que é a intenção se você busca terror), mas quando chega na hora da interação com o mundo aí a coisa desanda.
O combate é um dos piores que eu já joguei. Num capítulo avançado eu perdi com machado para um monstro que eu matei fácil com uma faca no primeiro capítulo. Além disso há o fato de você ter que ficar atento se você está no modo de combate, pois se não estiver vai ficar usando comandos de combate enquanto seu personagem apenas apanha quietinho.
Também vale ressaltar que o jogo é sandbox, fato que não consta na descrição. Não que os jogos precisem ser abertos para funcionar, há muitos lineares que funcionam e a maioria dos jogos de tiro é linear. O problema é que aqui ocorre exatamente o pior tipo de sandbox: o ""faça isso"". O que é o ""faça isso""? ""Faça isso"" significa que em certos momentos da narrativa você ficará preso até achar a única célula do mapa capaz de interagir e te lançar a próxima cena. Eu particularmente fiquei irritado quando eu estava em um hotel e a pista era fazer algo do lado de fora, eu o fiz o quebra-cabeça exterior e voltei e não havia mudado nada; fiquei um tempo nisso até resolver ver na internet o que fazer e descobrir que eu devia ir a uma parede onde antes não havia nada e usar um botão de elevador.
Ainda continuando o tópico sandbox, os mapas exteriores (até onde eu cheguei) não dão conta de um quarteirão. A explicação? Uma das saídas da cidade é um nevoeiro intransponível, e todas as outras ruas são vetadas por crateras.

Os gráficos do jogo são bacanas. Não é muito longo (salvei em dez horas de jogo), e o enredo foi bem feito e tem congruência.
Segue a maior parte dos padrões do silent hill, inclusive com finais meio bosta.
A jogabilidade, no começo, é um tanto difícil de aprender, mas com o tempo dá pra dominar. Não experimentei no controle, mas, se seguir o padrão dos demais, a jogabilidade no teclado é bem melhor.

O jogo rapidamente se transforma num jogo de ação com elementos fracos de terror, a história começa a se desdobrar de forma obvia e decepcionante, e a atuação dos outros atores, a não ser a do protagonista, simplesmente não passam a emoção devida o que dá um certo ar cômico para situações em que não deveria haver espaço para risadas. Para fãs da série, é extramamente aconselhável não jogar com expectativas, para pessoas que nunca jogaram silent hill por medo, ou qualquer coisa do tipo, o máximo que pode acontecer dentro deste episódio é um susto ou outro com sua própria sombra, visto que a aparição dos inimigos é perfeitamente evidente, e não há muitos elementos para causar o medo. Então avalio o jogo como um MEH/10 o que seria um 5/10, dá para ser jogado porém não vale a pena caso seja adquirido por um preço maior que 10 reais, e não haja um jogo melhor na mesma faixa de preço.

If you liked Alan Wake, you'll like this game. It's also a 3rd person horror game and it's almost as scary.

As for the gameplay,  you discover many weapons (melee or ranged) throughout the game but the ammos are limited so it's up to the player to use them wisely !

It's not really long but I would say it's adequate for this kind of game. It took me about 7-8 hours to finish. It's longer than most of the horror games nowadays.

As for the PC port, I read so many bad reviews that I was wondering if it would run on my computer. Finally, it worked without any problem for most of the game. I did NOT encounter any crash but at the end of the game, the game 'freezed' before saving for about 20-30 seconds. Pretty annoying but it's nothing game-breaking.

I had to plug a controller and then unplug it to finally be able to select the next wire. That was the worst bug I saw in this game.

Así que el motivo de que no recomiende su compra se reduce básicamente a que es un puto port de mierda, y punto. Estoy hasta la punta del cipote de que cada vez que me salga una pantalla de ""Cargando"" tenga que rezar 4 jesusitos de mi vida y un ave maría purísima para que no me crashee el juego porque. sí, son crasheos random. No es que haya un punto específico en el que el juego se pille, o lo haga por una acción tuya, no, es que es una puñetera lotería, y ojo que como te pille con el punto de guardado donde guardaste por última vez en el quinto pino, pues ya te cagas en todos los santos muertos de Konami o quien pollas haya hecho semejante despropósito de port. A ver como coño os buscais la vida sin Kojima, inútiles. Haced vuestro puto trabajo, ¿tan dificil es? Si sacais un port a PC, porteadlo bien, pero no me hagais esta chapuza por favor. No se si sera un caso aislado de Windows 7 o si pasa en más SO, pero así no se puede sacar un juego y pretender cobrar por ello.

Llevo 6 horas jugadas y apenas acabo de llegar a Silent Hill, para que os hagais una idea de la pérdida de tiempo que me lleva tener que llegar hasta donde estaba después de cada crasheo. ¿Así como puede jugar uno? Además de que se carga completamente la experiencia y la inmersión. Evidentemente he mandado el juego a tomar por culo. Ya no son solo los crasheos, sino problemas de texturas, sonido envolvente etc. Chapuza",
15096925,turkish,2015.02.28 23:29,✅,❌,0.6674322486,24,"Uzun zaman oldu Silent Hill oyunu oynamayalı. Koca seride bitirmediğim tek oyun Homecoming kalmıştı ve nihayet onun da sonunu getirmiş bulunuyorum. Silent Hill atmosferine o kadar aç kalmışım ki oyunu iki günde bitirdim :)

Silent Hill 4 The Room'dan sonra stüdyonun dağılması ve diğer firmalara oyun yaptırılmasıyla 2008 yılında hayranlarının tepkisini toplamayı başarmıştı Konami. Aynı yıl çıkan Silent Hill Origins gayet güzel bir oyundu ve seriye yenilikler getirmişti. Fakat ana oyun olarak geliştirilen Homecoming seriye devrimsel değişikliklerle geldi. Öncelikle oyunun Silent Hill adına yakışan bir oyun olduğunu söylemem gerekiyor ama tabi ki eskileri aratan eksikleri de var.

Kahramanımız Alex Shepherd askere gidiyor ve uzun yıllar yaşadığı kasabadan uzak kalıyor. Geri döndüğünde ise insanların kaybolmaya başladığını ve tuhaflıklar olduğunu anlamasıyla kaybolan kardeşi Joshua'nın peşine düşüyor. Seriye ilk getirilen farklılık oyunun Silent Hill kasabasında değil başka bir kasabada başlaması olmuş. Shepherd's Glen'de Silent Hill'i aratmıyor. 

Teknik kısımları açıklamaya başlayacak olursam öncelikle oyun gerilim ve gizem ağırlığından ödün vererek biraz daha combat ağırlıklı bir oyuna dönüşmüş ki ben bu tarz oyunlarda kavga dövüşten nefret ederim. Hatta boss savaşlarından bile yer yer nefret ediyorum. Homecoming'te ise 4 tane boss savaşı var ve bu normal bir Silent Hill için çok fazla. Sürekli aklımda ordan hemşire çıkacak mı yoksa köpek mi gelecek düşüncesi vardı ve bu yeterinde rahatsız edici bir şey benim için. Pc optimizasyonunun Dark Souls'tan biraz daha iyi olduğunu söylemeliyim. Yani vasatın altında bir optimizasyona sahip hatta yer yer Playstation'ımın dvd si çizilmiş te okumasını bekliyormuşum gibi uzun uzun bekledim oyunun akmasını.  Hikayesi gayet içine çeken ve anlatımıyla da takdir kazanmayı başarmış yapıda. Müzikleri ise her zaman ki gibi çok güzel. Puzzle ları önceki oyunlara göre oldukça basit tutulmuş. Havok grafik motoru Silent Hill'e çok yakışmış. Dodge sistemi ve kamera açısı ise bana Resident Evil 4'ü hatırlattı fazlasıyla.

Serinin hayranlarındansanız benim gibi Homecoming'i mutlaka oynamalısınız diye düşünüyorum çünkü The Order'a dair açıklayıcı bir senaryoya sahip üstelik eski oyunların hepsinin harmanlanarak önümüze sunuluşunun ne kadar fark yarattığını gözler önüne seriyor.

• First, the story and gameplay:

- The game is nice, it has a interesting story, perpahs not as good as the other SH titles, but it's still a nice game;
- You have a short variety of weapons, but they're still cool and useful;
- This game is more action paced than the others, you do really fight and dogde as a skilled veteran should be able to do (some might enjoy this and others doesn't, it depends on how you like things, I enjoy, so I see it as positive);
- The creatures and enviroments are nice, all in all, it is a nice SH game, it could be better, but it's still nice.


• Second, the PC port:

- This game was extremely bad ported to PC, the graphics are worse then it's on consoles, the controls are bad and they do fail sometimes, specialy during QTEs, the game crashes for nothing, audio is bad, so are subtitles;
- The game has many bugs and glitches since It's launch in 2008 and Konami never bothered trying to fix them, this game is abandoned;
- Despite it's awful quality, it's a expensive game that seldom goes into sale, when it goes, it's like 10~15%.
- While the game has an interesting story, this port is poorly made, as if Konami didn't want to do it and did it as worse as possible to give us the message ""we do not like PC gaming"" (which can be seen by the sheer fact that they do not bother making the new games for PC) that it ruins the experience.


Conclusion:
It's a good game that was poorly ported and abandoned right after it was made, which in the end ruins the experience.
I do not recommend this game, you'll waste your money and your time having to do things over and over because of bugs and glitches, that if you don't end up having to start all over because these bugs can corrupt your save files.
Konami doesn't like the PC gaming market, they made the older SH for PC and then ported this and left it on it's current state, worse then many betas and early-acess games, they do refuse to port or remake the other SH to PC, despite the fact that the fans have been asking them for years.
So, if you value your money, do not buy this, it's poorly made and the company who made this doesn't care about it or who buys it.

Review below ... 


The worst game I own on Steam.

Di-a-boli-cal. 

Slow, so slow it's unbelievable. Controls horrendous. Graphics pathetic and look 2002 era.

This is my first SH game and I hate it. When I had nearly finished chapter six I still had only have two hours game play on the clock. 

I am sick of dying. Stupid combat with inadequate weapons or no ammo. Sick as hell of having to repeat tragically difficult or awkward stuff. On top of that it crashes everytime I minimise it, like when looking for a walkthrough. Basically 2.5 hours of nothing and 50% of that time is from dying and repeating. What the hell is that for over 1/3 of the chapters of game?  Added to that pointless notes to read taking up time.

All I can say now is thank goodness a Steam copy arrived for £5.40, and not full Steam price of £18. 

I got worn out in the maze of the hotel in chapter six. I would do a tiny bit, and run back and save. Basically because save points are like one per chapter, occasionally two, and occasionally none. I tried to carry on a few times, and clawed my way through. Then finally I met the chapter six boss. It plays a trump card of insulting here. The combat controls change between the two stages of the boss fight. In the first half letting go of shift releases aim and you are free to move at normal speed. Second half, releasing shift does not let go of aim. It is toggled on.

Wrangling with the controls to axe the creature's arms is nearly impossible. By default it aims for the head which is out of reach. It is so hard to remember to cancel toggle shift after a strike. You get knocked down and get up to find you can hardly move because shift is still on. Smashed to the floor again. Maybe thirty goes at this boss. The end. I gave up. Four days it took me to try finish chapter six.

I did come back and do a bit more, beat the ch 6 boss after about fifty goes. I played on a little and the insults just kept coming. One was a code for a locker was the time on a clock on a wall. Basically without the ammo in the locker you can't beat the next mini-boss monster. Of course you can't minimise the game to check a walkthrough fo the code because it will crash. Therefor you are bound to re-start from last save.","Reminder to self - don't try to play it again.

The combat controls change between the two stages of the boss fight. In the first half letting go of shift releases aim and you are free to move at normal speed. Second half, releasing shift does not let go of aim. It is toggled on.

Wrangling with the controls to axe the creature's arms is nearly impossible. By default it aims for the head which is out of reach. It is so hard to remember to cancel toggle shift after a strike. You get knocked down and get up to find you can hardly move because shift is still on. Smashed to the floor again. Maybe thirty goes at this boss. The end. I gave up. Four days it took me to try finish chapter six.

I did come back and do a bit more, beat the ch 6 boss after about fifty goes. I played on a little and the insults just kept coming. One was a code for a locker was the time on a clock on a wall. Basically without the ammo in the locker you can't beat the next mini-boss monster. Of course you can't minimise the game to check a walkthrough fo the code because it will crash. Therefor you are bound to re-start from last save."

Because of this, all the rest are more or less a clone of the original series, and Home Coming, despite really feeling like one, is itself a pretty good one.

I am not going to go much into the game or gameplay itself, if you have ever played a Silent Hill game you already know what it is like.  There is not anything really new or different with Home Coming aside from the story.  Where the game is fun is just in the feeling of being in another Silent Hill story: the creepiness, puzzles and atmosphere are all there, and then there are definitely those moments where you have to just smile as what you just experienced was pretty awesome!

Beginning with story: Not engrossing enough to keep you gripped. You will typically be able to predict what is coming next.

The characters are wrote in such a way that they lack depth and it is hard to form a bond with them.

Gameplay: Punishing, almost arcade-style. You will die frequently as the enemies are scripted to pummel you with quicker attack speeds and wider attack range than you can achieve. You will find yourself spamming the dodge-uppercut move hoping for a lucky shot.

The puzzle sections are good, not great. They offer subtle aids to help you complete them, but the reward for your endeavour is not always felt.

The saving mechanic is flawed mainly because the save points are placed at random points, forcing you to rely on checkpoints. Some checkpoints are poorly done as they force you to watch cutscenes again and again that you can not skip.

Software: The software crashes at random points in the game. I don't claim to have the best gaming pc, but I have researched that even high spec pcs suffer from the random bugs infesting the software.

Verdict: This game has about 5% of the spirit of Silent Hill, leaving much to be desired.

Y probablemente se deba a que es el primero que se ha ""americanizado"", lo que le ha restado mucho del carisma que aportan los videojuegos japoneses; no es que sea una crítica a este sentido, sino que algunos detalles de genialidad sólo lo saben aportar desde el país del sol naciente. Aquí los personajes no poseen el mismo carisma, no resultan tan memorables como por ejemplo en Silent Hill 2; la historia tampoco resulta tan atractiva como en otros, y se nota cierta falta de alma por parte del videojuego.

Algo que sí se ha mejorado y que resultaba lamentable es el sistema de combate, tampoco es como para tirar cohetes, pero ahora es mucho más efectivo y requiere de habilidad. Las constantes en cuanto a escasez de munición y elementos siguen estando vigentes y resulta un desafío avanzar por los parajes de Sheper´s Glen, plagado de bestias sacadas de las pesadillas más macabras de los desarrolladores.

El nivel gráfico incluso me atrevería a decir que ha bajado, se han utilizado unos efectos ""granulosos"" que aunque se supone dotan al juego de aire cinematográfico, a mí me parece que más bien son una excusa para no reconocer la caída, nota muy presente por ejemplo en los rostros de los personajes; hasta ahora pocos videojuegos producían una sensación de emoción en los jugadores como esta saga; pero en este se ha perdido ese encanto, no ayuda tampoco como dije la falta de carisma de los personajes.

En definitiva, de todos los Silent Hill que han salido en PC, y habiendo completado también Origins y el primero, me parece en reglas generales el más decepcionante. No resulta tan recomendable como el resto, no es mal juego, pero le falta mucho para llegar al nivel de otros memorables.

por donde puedo empezar con este analisis a este juego.
--------
Historia:
--------
La historia gira en torno a Alex Shepherd , joven soldado recidente de la ciudad vecina de Silent Hill , Shepherd Gleen.
Luego de ser herido en el campo de batalla y muchas pesadillas, decide regresar a su hogar ya que siente que algo malo le a pasado a su hermano Josh Shepherd.
Al llegar encuentra que algo anda mal ya que no hay personas en la ciudad y poco a poco se ve envuelto en la pesadilla que a corrompido Shepherd Gleen hasta llegar a la ciudad de la niebla eterna.....Silent Hill,para lograr encontrar respuestas a sus inquietudes...
Esta es la propuesta que nos plantea Homecoming.
La historia aunque en un principio parece simple poco a poco se va volviendo mas compleja, como el descubrimiento de la orden que se ve envuelta en la historia , revelaciones importantes con respecto a nuestro protagonista y la pregunta  a la que gira la drama ¿donde y que le paso a Josh y la gente del pueblo?
en este sentido la historia es buena , oscura e interesante.
--------
Graficos:
--------
Silent Hill Homecoming aunque lanzado en el 2008 tiene un motor grafico muy imponente, con un sistema de iluminacion,particulas, sombras brutal! que logra envolverte totalmente  y texturas increibles de gran detalle y tamaño [imponentes con texturas de 1024x1024 y 2048x2048 cuando juegos modernos recurren a texturas de baja calidad de 512x512....]
aunque no todo es color de rosa, ya que Alex y las criaturas con las que te encontraras tendran esa calidad pero los personajes secundarios aun con texturas de gran tamaño tienen muy poca definicion.
algo que lo hace un tanto inconsistente pero que para los que no nos preocupamos tanto por los graficos no nos va a hacer mucho problema ,pero si eres pc gamer pro.... pues esas texturas te van a hacer sangrar los ojos.
--------
Sonido:
--------
Simplemente....MAGNIFICO! Akira Yamaoka lo hizo denuevo con un soundtrack muy bueno , temas vocales muy acorder con la trama y musica complementaria que te logra envolver en el juego.
este juego esta echo para jugarlo con audifonos a todo volumen!
--------
Jugabilidad:
--------
Aqui encontramos uno de los puntos mas bajos con este producto... la jugabilidad aunque en parte es comodo, las animaciones son un tanto robotizadas con respecto a nuestro personaje [ya que las criaturas tienen animaciones espectaculares y muy naturales] ,aunque los controles son en parte comodos, en si se siente raro a comparacion con los juegos mas clasicos.... talves sea por el cambio de camara u otros factores pero en si no es nada dificil aprender a jugar homecoming por lo tanto cumple que no te frustres con los controles.

Homecoming es hasta el momento uno de los silent hill con mayor desarrollo de personajes, entre los cuales destacamos a Alex Shepherd, Josh Shepherd,Elle Holloway, James Wheeler, Adam Shepherd, Lillian Shepherd , Margaret Holloway,Martin Fitch,Sam Bartlett [ademas de personajes fallecidos y otros que tienen relacion baja con menciones y cartas].
algunos se desarrollan de manera muy bien mientras que otros simplemente parece que estan de relleno porque no se desarrollan a mucha profundidas pero si son importantes para el desarrollo de la historia y eso hace un poco mas inconsistente el juego.
--------
Con eso terminamos con una evaluacion de juego simple.... pero esto es un SILENT HILL asi que tenemos que evaluarlo como parte de la saga...
--------
Como Silent Hill de la saga numerica:
--------
aun con ciertos errores en la inconsistencia del juego,Silent Hill Homecoming logra hacerte sentir en la saga, tras lo diferente que fue The Room, Homecoming logra hacerte sentir [como su nombre del juego indica]""de vuelta a casa"".
una atmosfera mas que absorvente, un nuevo ""otro mundo"" de los mas perturbadores de toda la saga [yo lo pondria entre el segundo y tercer puesto de otros mundos mas pertubadores]
Criaturas de las que yo considero mas perturbadoras y con un diseño que si en algun momento te encontraras en una calle.... harian que se te caigan los pantalones de terror que producen.
5 finales muy bien estructurados que no desentonan con la saga [salvo el final ufo... pero se perdona]
un soundtrack excelente como toda la saga, el maestro Akira Yamaoka logro su cometido con este juego.
para finalizar el analisis....
¿Recomiendo Homecoming? porsupuesto que si! Homecoming es un juego entretenido, con fidelidad a la saga , los chicos de doble helix lograron su cometido de querer regresar a parte de sus origenes a silent hill aunque eso si hay partes muy bien echas y cosas que no son muy de sus origenes que digamos para finalizar hay que aclarar que no es perfecto es un juego bueno pero no uno perfecto como los de Silent Team,
Nota Final: 8.5/10

Cuando vuelve se encuentra que su pueblo ha cambiado mucho y ha desaparecido la mayoría de la gente con una conexión muy clara, un pueblo de al lado llamado silent hill.

Para mi gusto es el peor silent hill de todos, pero no deja de ser silent hill. Quién haya jugado a más silent hill no saldrá defraudado, aunque como digo, no llega a la calidad de los tres primeros.

Para quien no haya jugado nunca a silent hill decir que silent hill homecoming es un survival, originario de consolas, no lo olvidemos, en el que lo que más destaca es la historia, la duración es corta, los puzzles son bastante sencillitos , esta orientado (por lo menos este más) a la acción y es bastante pasillero a modo de ejemplo, poder moverte por parte de un pueblo y que esten todas las puertas cerradas menos las necesarias para continuar la historia). El juego no carece de quicktime events pero hay que reconocer que son muy puntuales. Consta de cinco finales diferentes que varíaran según las decisiones que tomemos en tres momentos claves de la aventura, y como todos los finales, meh.

Viéndolo asi la verdad es que puede quitar las ganas de jugar, pero no, tiene algo, ese algo que ha convertido esta saga en un icono del videojuego de terror.

Tecnicamente es un port de consolas, y se nota, pero dentro de lo que cabe se juega bastante bien (con mando, con teclas no lo se) y con algunos problemas con la cámara al atacar  que pronto te acostumbras. Los gráficos no son de otro mundo y  sufre de ciertas ralentizaciones puntuales pero como ya he dicho, son salvables.

Insisto que, el mejor punto a favor es su atmósfera, su historia y el folklore característico de esta franquicia que le ha hecho ser un imprescindible en los juegos de terror.

A la espera de que alguna vez konami se digne a traernos a steam los tres primeros silent hill  (y el 4, aunque éste es más flojo) no me queda más que recomendar éste y desear que el próximo, el llamado silent hills también aparezca por compatibles.

Co by dużo nie mówić, gra od początku poraża oprawą graficzną z zeszłego stulecia niemniej w tym akurat przypadku dodaje to grze upiornego uroku, do tego dochodzi równie koszmarne sterowanie i praca kamery, którą spokojnie można posądzić o permanentnego zeza, szczególnie jak se wniknie w teksturę za plecami bohatera i od tego momentu posługujemy się jeno zmysłem słuchu oraz szóstym zmysłem, co dodatkowo potęguje koszmarną atmosferkę ;>
Mimo tych wad/zalet (tak, tak, niektórzy uważają takie oldskulowe sterowanie za dar od Boga, #bożesztymój) , gra ma niezwykły klimat, będący jej wizytówką i proszę nie porównywać tego tytułu do crapowatych filmideł - OK, jedynka jeszcze ujdzie, ale dwójka to profanacja totalna, za którą producenci tego parcha sami powinni trafić do tytułowego Silent Hill, w ramach szeroko rozumianej pokuty ;D Filmy to kaszanka, gry to prawdziwe salami z osła, albo innego okapi.

Do tego co wyżej, dochodzą coraz to koszmarniejsze poczwary, których eksterminację uskutecznia się z reguły za pomocą oręża białego, który szybko staje się czerwony, amunicji do pukawek (na wyższym poziomie trudności) jest tradycyjnie jak na lekarstwo, zresztą lekarstw tyż nie ma za dużo i całe szczęście, bo najgorszym ciosem dla serii byłoby wprowadzenie autoregeneracji ;]

Déjà, en y jouant sous steam, le nombre de crashs est hallucinant (entre toute les 5 et 20 minutes) et on ne peux pas alt+tab sans crash non plus. Obligé de jouer hors steam, en lançant en tant qu'administrateur pour ""résoudre"" ces 2 problèmes (malgré ça, le jeu crash encore de temps en temps). 

En plus de ça, on a des bugs sonores (sons qui ne sortent que d'un haut parleur), des temps de chargement à rallonge (parfois en pleine séquence de gameplay, le jeu se fige pendant une bonne demie-minute).

Et si vous pensez que je suis un cas isolé, allez donc faire une recherche sur le net...

Pour continuer sur les défauts du jeu, l'orientation plus ""action"" que les anciens épisodes aurait pu ne pas être une mauvaise chose si les esquives n'étaient pas à timer à la micro-seconde près (surtout avec les boss), et que la seule arme de mélée efficace soit le couteau (que l'on a dès le début) relégant les 2 autres types d'arme de mélée au rang d'ouvres-porte (littéralement).

Tout ça est vraiment dommage, car l'ambiance est fidèle au reste de la saga (et réussi à nouer les univers des jeux avec celui des films) et l'histoire est assez prenante si on réussi à dépasser tous les problèmes techniques. 

Les musiques, et le sound design qui, eux, sont toujours l'oeuvre du même bonhomme depuis le début jouent clairement un rôle la réussite de la restitution de l'univers ""Silent Hill"", et on peut noter que graphiqement, le tout tiens la route pour un jeu qui a plus de 5 ans.

Once I got through the usual black screen startup inherent to a lot of rushed PC games, I had to figure out why the game was running on such a low (often stuttering) framerate on my usually quite decent hardware (core i5 + gtx 770), but after tinkering few minutes with some settings in the config files and trying to overload vsync in nvidia control panel (turning it off gave me terrible screen tearing, which was a pretty bad sign considering my hardware and the game graphics), I got to the conclusion that the game was just performing the best it could and that its coding was just a mess... of course this was confirmed when I encountered ridiculous 5/10 seconds freezes after some cutscenes. The whole thing was starting to make me quite uneasy as save points in this game are set way too far appart, but more on that soon!

Anyway, despite the terrible performance, I still wanted to give it a shot, as I'm a big amateur of the Silent Hill series and actually owned the same game on X360, but never got much far due to the utter annoyance of the combat system in hard difficulty and one awful freeze that made me lost one hour of boring gameplay. But this time I was determined to go through with it, thinking a pretty average game with Akira Yamaoka's music might at least give me a bit of pleasure.

So there i was, wasting another time tediously running around on some cheap scavenger hunt from corridor to corridor in what appears to be an even more cheap knock off of a Silent Hill game, which quickly throws a bunch of cliches from Silent Hill 2  at you without even trying to have its own identity. It's really quite impressive how bad Double Helix was at this, but hardly surprising if you look at their other games or even at the ones from their former companies (nothing really good appart from a bunch of games in the 90's). How they got this gig is mind-boggling and just shows how Konami execs have become out of touch this last decade to the point of trusting these hacks with one of their most emblematic franchise. It's kind of sad from a company that most definitely was at the top of its game from the 8bit to the PS2 era (one of my best gaming memories as a kid where on their SNES games. still remember how seeing their logo screen popping up would instantly reassure me that I was in for some quality gaming time).

But I disgress... Remember what I said about those save points being way too far appart for a buggy game like this? Right after the first level of the game, you get into a really tedious part of the game, which pretty much consists of running around way too much in different parts of the town. I only had one save point in the beginning, but then I got to almost fully explore a house, picked up quite a bunch of stuff, got to explore the first part of a cemetery only to have to backtrack quite far, because I didn't see the right climbing path the first time around. And then, just before I finally got to the next save point, BAM! got accidentely ALT-TABed out of the game, which of course crashed when I tried to get back in it! Almost made me smile... Almost :p. Anyway, I was just looking for a good reason to put this game down early (and forever. this time) and it looks like it made me a favor by collapsing from the weight of its own mediocrity after a mere 1 hour of gameplay.

So there you have it. Think twice before buying this terrible port. Even if you actually remotely enjoyed it on consoles, you're probably going to have a bad time. Besides, there are so much better games like this one to try (hell, even a small indie game like Lone Survivor gets it more). In the meanwhile Konami might pull their head out of their arse and redeem themselves by releasing the 4 earliest Silent Hill games on Steam. Hopefully it'll happen before they cut their veins open, while ingesting pachinko balls and frenetically playing DDR until they die while trying to figure out how they can ""revive"" another franchise.

Alors Silent Hill Homecoming, que vaut il ?... Et bien dans mon souvenir, c'était bien mais pas fou. Jugement un peu faible puisqu'en 2014, le jeu plantait systématiquement dans les égouts, et je ne suis jamais allé plus loin. Aujourd'hui je me suis penché sur le problème et ai trouvé un patch non officiel qui marche au top (pour moi, car pas pour tout le monde). Je joue en 2560x1440 aucun crash aucun ecran noir, plus de bug, hormis le son.

Du coup on avance un peu plus loin on en découvre plus et du coup, c'est pas trop mal dans l'ensemble, l'univers les musiques les monstres, on s'y retrouve. Sur clavier l'expérience de jeu est clairement fluide comparé à certains jeux. Je n'ai pas testé avec la manette.

Quelques pertes de fps par moment, et un son qui bug aussi, apparemment il faut passer le son windows sur du 5.1 ou installer razer surround je sais pas quoi, ça n'a pas fonctionné.

Je viens de finir le jeu, enfin une des premières fin car Silent Hill est bien réputé pour avoir plusieurs fin selon vos choix,  un beau rebondissement à la fin même si pour les plus impliqués c'était évident. Globalement il est pas mal, même si certains points me gêne, comme le manque cruel de munition, certains passages un peu ""vide"", et le système de combat qui donne du nouveau mais ne vous rend pas forcément à l'aise pendant les combats. Et gros point noir, l'apparition de Pyramid Head très légère, aucune poursuite, aucun combat, vraiment dommage pour un personnage emblématique du jeu.

Pour 5 euros en promo, rien à redire.  20 € en temps normal, vu l'age du jeu, un poil cher.

Let me start off by politely, and courteously, taking a moment to ask why, out of every Silent Hill game, is this the only one on Steam? Now don't get me wrong, I'll get to Homecoming in a moment, but as most other entries in the series had PC ports, why. biased Konami, is this the only one Steam gets? 

With that out of the way, Silent Hill Homecoming is the sixth main entry in the SH series, a psychological survival-horror series that has come to be known best for its atmosphere, story, surrealism, and creepy monster designs.

Silent Hill Homecoming came out on the heels of the Silent Hill film, and it shows. Several monster designs and much of the visual look of the game can be attributed to the film. Most notably, the game has some impressive Otherworld transition sequences inspired by the movies. They look cool, and sound cool, so they at least get the job done there.

And that's something to be said for Homecoming. It's not a terrible looking game, the designs of the characters and monsters at least look cool, the environments look appropriately ominous, and the fog effects, while a bit sparser than other entries in the series, are still rather well-handled.

However, the film inspiration becomes a bit much in areas. This was the game that shoe-horned Pyramid Head in for no reason, and I literally mean no reason. Oh, he appears in cutscenes, but not a single time in gameplay. Not once. And that's not even arguing on how he has no reason to be here. Both in the fact he literally does nothing in the story and it goes against on what Pyramid Head was in SH2. And then there's scenes that were so obviously inspired by the movie, and enemies inspired by the movie. It essentially is an extension to the Silent Hill movie in game form, honestly.

But so much goes against what the SH series is. I was literally in hysterics during a scene almost half-way in the game when suddenly you get a sassy black sidekick comic relief character and escape a police station being invaded Dawn of the Dead style by giant hammerhead land-shark monsters. Don't get me wrong, this is brilliant B-Movie hamminess, but what the fuck is it doing in the fucking Silent Hill series?

And that's what I think one of Homecoming's biggest problems is. It doesn't know what the SH series is. I am convinced the creators just watched the SH movie and made the game based off of that. There's no other explanation for it. Homecoming must of at one point in development been a video game adaption of the movie, because it has so much in common with the film; the nurses work just like they do in the film, so does the cult, and the aesthetics... But it's almost nothing like how the rest of the series is.

But let's get off our fixations of its identity crisis and focus more on the game as its own experience.

Silent Hill Homecoming tells the story of a man named Alex Sheppard who's returning from the military to visit his home in Sheppard's Glen (of course conveniently named after his family). He's been gone for a long time and finds that his hometown has completely changed. There's a few people still living in town, but the place is mostly deserted. Alex comes home to find his brother and father are missing, and his mom seems completely out of it with a pistol on her lap. Alex goes to investigate what exactly has happened to his family, and to this town, and what sort of connection it has with the nearby local resort town of Silent Hill.

To the story's credit, I did end up liking a few of the characters, most notably Alex, who did end up earning some sympathy from me through his journey. And Wheeler, your sassy black comedy relief character, was enjoyable, though so out of place. Most everyone else was forgettable, however. The plot twists unfortunately are mostly super predictable, the worst of all being the 'main' twist, and while I don't want to spoil the game, towards the end we get into some ludicrous Saw-inspired segments that just feel completely out of left field and unneeded. Homecoming also holds my personal honor for having the worst multiple endings I have ever experienced in a horror game. I'm not kidding, they are that bad.

The game has a few puzzles, and by puzzles I mean over half of them are sliding tile puzzles or this puzzle about crossing wires. Whoever the fuck at Double Helix thought that making most of the puzzles in the game fucking sliding puzzles really deserves a solid kick in the ass.

The game is also overly focused on combat. The combat to be fair isn't bad, with a very Zelda-esque system, being able to lock-onto enemies and circle and roll-dodge from them, but the weapons are notably unbalanced with some being far better than others. Also while technically the 'best' combat system in the series (and they try to rationalize it with the fact Alex is an ex-soldier), the series was never really about the combat, making it feel like the developers missed the point.

Also the PC port is a hit or miss based on your system. It either works perfectly fine, or it doesn't. Fans have made a lot of work-arounds for problems in the game, but it has had absolutely no official support. It was basically released on Steam, and left to die there.

This so far makes it sound like I hate Homecoming, but in earnest I didn't.

Homecoming has so much wrong with it, as a Silent Hill game, as a horror game, and as an action game, that it's easy to mention, but it's actually not a terrible game, and has several quite good moments and actually is an okay to good game, though I'd argue one of the weakest in its series.

Homecoming has some decent moments. Exploring the house is both interesting and a bit haunting. Going into the basement the first time is a bit unnerving. A few of the boss fights, especially the second one, are actually well-done. The game isn't too repetitive and does have moments that split away from just combat or just exploration. Speaking of that, there's a decent exploration element in this game that often is a bit rewarding for little extra tidbits, imagery, and sometimes goodies and hidden weapons. The game has some fun unlockable costumes and weapons.

The story is enjoyable in a B-fare kind of way, and is backed by good music and sound design. While not Akira's best work, the music still holds up well for the title. There are small touches to the game too and details that are appreciated, including each grave stone in the graveyard having a different description on them (and there are many), some small scares that the player may miss if they aren't observant or don't explore a bit. The atmosphere is okay, though the game really isn't scary.

But I didn't hate my time with it, in fact, I would say I enjoyed myself playing it. It's got so many flaws and they're so easy to point out, but despite it all there is an enjoyable game in here. It honestly probably would of been better if it was Silent Hill The Movie: The Game though, as it really does things that just doesn't sit right as a fan of the series. But in its own way, it's an enjoyable B-Movie sort of horror game that has dips into legitimately good moments and ideas. 

If you go in expecting some B-Horror fun, as opposed to a Silent Hill game, it's a pretty okay to good game in its own right, just has some flaws, but I wouldn't say the flaws ruin the game and there is some fun and interesting sections to be had as the game goes on. If you go to it for a Silent Hill fix, however, I think you'll be bitterly disappointed. A misguided, but ultimately pretty okay game, that could of been a good game if it wasn't bogged down by a few problems.","A bit of a warning, this will be my rantiest review I think I've ever done.

 NO RECOMENDADO PARA LA MAYORIA : La verdad que a pesar de ser tan criticado y de tener muchos errores y horrores tecnicos para mi es un muy buen juego de terror y tiene todo lo que se puede esperar de un Silent Hill. Solo que ahora tiene un enfoque distinto en lo que es el combate, en parte por que asi tiene coherencia con la historia del PJ , que seria un ex-soldado. La experiencia de juego se potencia si se juega de noche , en la oscuridad y solo si es posible.
   Los controles no son malos para nada, pero son dificiles de acostumbrarse, yo uso mouse y teclado , quizas con joestick la cosa es mejor. Pero esto hace que crezca la tension a la hora de afrontar los monstruos , c/u de estos se convierten en un reto aparte.
   Graficamente es genial , de lo mejor visto en un SH , con un calido efecto de pelicula vieja . No tiene casi nada que envidiarle a ""Downpoor"" aunque podria haber aprovechado mas los recursos de la PC y no poner opciones tan""CONSOLERAS"". Aun asi hay que tener en cuenta que este es un juego de hace casi 6 años 
  Y para los que sufren de ""cuelgues"" , a mi me paso por probar configuraciones en la grafica, en mi caso el Nvidia control panel. Parece que al juego no le gustan estas modificaciones ,asi que conviene dejar todo en predeterminado asi no van a tener problemas salvo algun que otro congelamiento momentaneo que no pude solucionar, parones que pueden sacarte las ganas de seguir jugando.

  conclusion : Recomendar  (si tenes mucha , pero mucha paciencia, te bancas los muchos problemas y fallos tecnicos y sos muy , muy fanatico de la saga) Es una obra maestra del terror psicologico. Silent hill nunca se vio tan real , gracias a las fisicas vas a correr la cosas de lugar , abrir puertas ,etc de una forma muy verosimil. El sonido es opresivo y terrorifico como siempre. Hay una permanente sensacion de que algo malo va a pasar ,que en verdad aumenta la tension.",

Unless you can somehow get this game for free I would highly recommend not buying it. I can't even finish playing my copy because there are so many bugs and issues. I love the Silent Hill series and have played most of them on the PlayStation, but Homecoming on the PC is an absolute travesty.

The key controls for the game that are weird and so are the prompts for certain buttons.
There are many places where the camera angle becomes awkward and the only way to fix it is to run around and hope that your camera centers again. In addition the alt + tab only manages to cause the game to crash.

However the biggest issue and what has ultimately caused me to write this review and prevent me from even finishing the game is that half way through playing Homecoming has failed to register my keyboard. No matter what keys I press no effect will register. It is not frozen because my mouse still works in the game I just can't move or open the menu screen.

Like I said I love the Silent Hill games however these aren't issues that I can just ignore and look past which I have been known to do for many games. These are problems that make the game unplayable and I'm rather disappointed..

I usually don't recommend stuff that I haven't finished yet but what I am feeling now is important enough to break this rule.

I feel like I am trying to open a fucking coconut barehanded in the desert. Fighting to open the friggin coconut that may be empty just because I am in the desert and if the stuff inside the coconut is good it'll be worth but if it isn't I'll end hurt and sad.

I found SH Homecoming on Steam and gladly bought it because I was missing those spooky games and I din't felt like playing Dead Space again so huh, why not? I could've played those stuff that have been coming out those last years but I seriously think that games were you just run and hide into closets praying to the dumb AI ""please, don't look at here!!!"" sucks therefore my options were limited and here I am.

I saw bad ports before like Devil May Cry 3 or Dark Souls but this one is a gem. You can't alt tab because it'll crash the game, everytime you die you'll face an absurdly long loading that of course is there to make you avoid death...right? The controls are clumsy and so is the camera. Sometimes, while being raped by monsters the game will show  prompts asking you to mash buttons like ""1"", ""2"", ""3"" or ""4"" so if you know a place that sells a gamepad with those buttons please let me know!

""So why do you recommend this?"" you ask. Welp, its basically Silent Hill again. Akira Yamaoka is still there, the city, the feel, the shitty combat, retarded dogs, creepy stuff, all of it, and I feel like that if the ending pleases me a couple of days later I'll forget about all the problems about it.

If you like Silent Hill, get in there. It'll probably be the best worst game you'll play for some time.

The strong points of the series have always been atmosphere, design, and sheer compelling mystery. Homecoming fails on all of these points. 

Firstly, the story, unlike those in previous games, is utterly predictable and tedious. It's straight out of the worst horror movies; every spoken line will seem familiar and you can predict half the scenes and twists before they happen. The stories in the previous games weren't always perfectly written, but they were never this insultingly cliché. There's no mystery, no creeping fear, no unresolved questions.

As for the monsters, they nearly look right for the series, but their behavior is worlds apart. Instead of being willful and mysterious, they're just like the posturing, aggressive beasts you'll find in any other game. That's more a matter of taste, but fighting them is definitely more simplistic than before. When you engage an enemy, you can practically feel the scripting pop into gear; the whole process is nothing but a timing game. Block, button mash, the end. Or, if the monster gets a hit in, enjoy being hit again and again and again as you try to either get back up or get out of the way. It's cheap and nothing but cheap, and not remotely enjoyable. Compounding this fact is that you have only 3 melee weapons that differ in speed and attack pattern, and these qualities stay the same even when you get new weapons (which just replace one of these 3, and play exactly the same).

The puzzles are shockingly simple. The solutions are frequently completely obvious, sometimes even without reading the hint (which is usually posted immediately near the puzzle, and barely obscures the solution if at all). In two cases, object interaction puzzles are actually repeated; one is only slightly different the second time around, but the other one is literally the exact same puzzle with the exact same method of solution! Overall, the puzzles come off like an afterthought, and add nothing to the experience.

After enjoying SAW verry much, Konami dissapointed me so hard to the poing that i wont get any other game distributed by them regardless how much i would like to play it. How Steam can justify selling this crap is beyond me."

Yeah, it isn't nearly as scary as SH1 but it is still good! This is an American take on the series and I think they did a good job. I like the story and the protagonist. This game has more of an action game feel with no riddles that I really remember being in past SH titles. I think the games looks good, and is fun to play. It feels like the same length as other SH titles, so it shouldn't take too long. Also, there are alternate outfits and endings to up the replay aspect.

Oczywiście... mając wcześniej na uwadze, że tego typu pełnoprawnych produkcji na platformę PC jest dość skromna liczba.Pamiętając również, że to piąta odsłona charakterystycznej dla siebie serii, dalej patrząc przez pryzmat historii gatunku.Gra szczególnie wnosi inną mechanikę opierającą się o bardziej dynamiczne starcia z przeciwnikami, które stawiają na naszą ekstremalną zręczność typu unik/blok, atak.

Klimat gry i zarazem jej najważniejszy element jest wystarczająco gęsty, mocny, ale już średnio przerażający i bardziej znowu uzależniający/wciągający.Potęguje go bezbłędna (bardzo dobra) oprawa dźwiękowa, starsza grafika i dobra fabuła, serwująca jedno z pięciu możliwych zakończeń - w moim przypadku zakończenie godne mistrza :P czyli to Dobre.

So I might have been to young to habe played the original silent hill when it was new, but I did play it at a friends house, also played 2 and 3 and shattered memories + downpour, I still think Silent hill 1 is the best in the franchise and this can and will never touch that. But how everyone whines about how it does not fit the silent hill universe and all, I will mostly ignore that in this review: this is my review about Shepherd's glen, homecoming.

so to get the silent hill things out of the way:
athmosphere: indeed, I got more scared by the blur of the dated silent hill, but this still can scare if you are playing alone in the dark and really into the game, but it will never get close to other titles in the franchise. Also the monsters: in other games they might have been more scary and here more agresive, but going with the entire silent hill thing of the character's mind and all, it actually fits. Alex is a very VERY agresive person, most of the other games featured just normal people, nothing with a real agresive past where here you have a soldier! added up with an abusive past no wonder this guy likes to fight.

Well, let us go on with Shepgerd's glen, homecoming;
bugs? I've played trough this at least three times and never have I encountered anything but a few weird monster movement wich to be honest made the things more scary.
pord? well, I have seen better, WAY BETTER. but this is NOT one of the worst, some of the buttons are awkward but it could have gone full lego lord of the rings.
story? Personally, I LOVE the story, it has great moments and for me it fits all into place.
soundtrack? It's still a silent hill game, and Akira Yamaoka is still on it, off course it's great.


So the review in short: 
Personally I love it a lot, rip it of the silent hill title and people would call it a silent hill look a like, but remove those people and you got a very VERY nice game, sadly there are a lot of people getting bugs, if they would fix it for those people I'll call this an easy 7.5/10
I guess a 7/10, not silent hill but not horrible.

The best part of this game is unlike other Silent Hill games the graphics are nice. However it lacks the atmosphere, the world does not seem as oppressive with human enemies and your two sidekicks running around with you. The combat is annoying, you cannot change weapon whilst aiming a gun and if you get knocked down when you get up you return to the aim view. You can easily get stuck where you get knocked down then by the time you get up and aim again you get knocked down again. So you have to use the melee weapons but once you get the knack you can defeat all the enemies (even the bosses) with the basic knife which then removes the tension. Another issue is some of the save points are ages apart.
