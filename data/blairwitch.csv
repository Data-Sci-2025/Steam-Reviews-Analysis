205331518,english,2025.08.27 20:43,✅,❌,0.5,0,"As a fan of The Blair Witch Project (1999), one of last original and truly groundbreaking horror movies in history of cinema, I was more than happy with announcement of new Blair Witch video game, mostly because I have fond memories for playing unforgettable Blair Witch Trilogy (Rustin Parr, The Legend of Coffin Rock, The Elly Kedward Tale) survival horror adventures on PC in early 2000s (by Terminal Reality, today sadly closed developer of Nocturne and BloodRayne 1&2).

While I can agree with many fans about some issues with the story and it's confusing denouement ([spoiler]there is still debate over alleged time-traveling element[/spoiler]), always reliable Bloober Team nailed the creepy atmosphere of the first movie (smartly positioning the plot in the 1990s). There was no need for more complex mechanics because it's horror video game with focus on story, and pet lovers will appreciate the use of dog companion, wonderful German shepherd Bullet who is main attraction.
After positive experience, I would love some kind of sequel, again from Bloober Team. There is plenty of material in Blair Witch fictional mythos (inspired by real life urban and village legends in America and world)...","As a fan of The Blair Witch Project (1999), one of last original and truly groundbreaking horror movies in history of cinema, I was more than happy with announcement of new Blair Witch video game, mostly because I have fond memories for playing unforgettable Blair Witch Trilogy (Rustin Parr, The Legend of Coffin Rock, The Elly Kedward Tale) survival horror adventures on PC in early 2000s (by Terminal Reality, today sadly closed developer of Nocturne and BloodRayne 1&2).

The atmosphere is amazing, and whatever ""behind the curtains"" tricks they pulled to make the woods WORK the way they did was impressive, you'll get trapped in repeating loops in ways that boggle the mind. I felt lost immediately, the sense of paranoia is palpable and the ""combat"" system is one of the most interesting I've played in any horror game, scared the fuck out of me, felt like a schizophrenia simulator. I enjoyed the story, I could see some fans of the film disliking it, but I personally enjoyed it. Great visuals.
However the game has its rough edges. There's moments where it wants you to hit ""interact"" or ""command dog"" and there's absolutely no intuitive sense to some of these moments. I nearly deleted the game over what I thought was a game breaking glitch, turns out it just wanted me to INTERACT with an object that only the dog could reach, not COMMAND DOG to get the dog to go get it. Very stupid, very immersion ruining moment in an otherwise incredibly immersive experience.","Has issues but very scary and immersive. A lot to love, some to hate.

204524445,brazilian,2025.08.17 06:52,✅,✅,0.5,0,"Bom game no geral. É um terror que prende pela história e te faz querer descobrir o mistério por trás de tudo. Excelente para quem gosta de uma experiência mais lenta, com foco na imersão e na exploração.
A ambientação é um dos pontos fortes: a escuridão e a ausência de luz ao longo do jogo aumentam bastante a tensão e deixam a gameplay mais envolvente.
O final, na minha opinião, poderia ter sido melhor, talvez por eu ter criado muitas expectativas. Ainda assim, é um bom game de terrorzinho psicológico e vale a experiência.

Игра пыталась намекнуть, что не стоит в неё соваться, ведь она не запускается на современных процессорах, а разработчикам на это начихать, но решил поискать как запустить. Завелась, но по итогу прохождения решил для себя, что лучше бы этого не произошло, а всему виной:
- медленная ходьба без какого-либо понимания что, куда, зачем идти (это в начале, со временем привыкаешь, но на это нужно много времени);
- оооооочень медленное развитие сюжета, а самый смак будет только в последней главе, до которой путь вымощен тропой из страданий и уныния;
- здравствуй периодическая кромешная тьма (хоть глаз выколи) от чего ещё тяжелее понять, где находишься (о да, топографический кретинизм), хотя всё же адаптировался, но см. первый пункт;
- собака, которая чаще всего живёт своей забагованной жизнью, часто вертится ни с чего на одном месте, порой вдруг убегает и ещё чаще пробегает мимо сюжетных мест, от чего однажды пришлось пять кругов нарезать, пока не понял, что надо бы посмотреть кассету и убрать дерево с дороги;
- сложно играть, но не от того, что какие-то прям сверхсложные загадки или неубиваемые монстры, а из-за тяжёлой атмосферы окружения.

Пожалуй, единственное светлое пятно игры – это последняя глава, которая одновременно даёт нам новые загадки, но и раскрывает сюжет, от чего становится на удивление очень интересно. Но стоит ли оно того решать вам.

Тема с кассетами и выискивании в них предметов для разгадок также интересная, как и всякая мистика, но этого не очень много.

Я не против бродилок-ужастиков, прощаю тут скримеры, хотя недолюбливаю их всей душой, но простить нудный геймплей в большей части игры тут уж не могу. Может и задумка интересная, но могли бы хоть какую-то карту придумать с компасом, чтобы было понимание, где находимся и в какую сторону в теории надо двигаться (а-ля как было в Firewatch хотя бы).

В общем лучше бы сделали какое-никакое кинцо с QTE и вариантами действий, тут это бы пошло по стилю куда больше. Так что игра хорошая, но завалена унынием.

   O jogo tem muitos aspectos pra comentar, mas em resumo.

Doesn't invite really to play it a second time to try it since the beginning and middle part are kinda boring (specially if you already played it).

Blair Witch больше похоже не на хоррор, а на ВИЧ-тест: долго мучаешься, нервничаешь, а в конце результат всегда один и такой себе.
Геймплей обсуждать не будем, там всё ясно. Но атмосфера хорошая, отличный мрачный лес, параноидальная музыка, шёпот и иллюзия, что тебя реально преследует что-то страшное🥰 (но через пару часов перестаёшь бояться и начинаешь злиться не из-за ужаса, а потому что очередной камень не даёт пройти👹) 
Текстуры = мем. В одном месте, дерево можно обойти, в другом это непробиваемая стена. Камни выглядят так, будто их рисовал школьник. А иногда ты застреваешь в щели так нелепо, что пoрнo-индустрия отдыхает, приходится перезаходить, а ручные сейвы не работают, и начинаешь задолго до трагедии.
Давайте о хорошем - пёсик Буллет<3 Главный друг и спасение? Неа. Разрабы решили поиздеваться: чтобы его погладить, нужно подойти под правильным углом, предметы ищет через раз, зато в начале можно настроить внешность пса🥰, но в финальных сценах он будет дефолтный👹 Но всё равно именно он вытягивает игру. Честно, половина игроков проходила ради собаки, а не ради сюжета.
Я вначале подумала, ну пройду на 100проц и забуду игру как страшный сон🥰
Моя попка окончательно сгорела на ачивках👹 Женщина, ты ёбнутая? - гг должен найти пропавшего мальчика в лесу, а тут сюжетная подружка обижается, что я мало звоню по телефону. Связь ловит не всегда, у нас вообще-то пропажа, а не время выяснять отношения. Но если не звонил - всё, считай, плохая концовка. Бред.
Оптимизация 🥰 хммммм ГОВНО! 👹 То фпс падает, то крашится в самый трогательный момент, я несу Буллета на руках и уже рыдаю как сука, а тут БАЦ, рабочий стол. Отличная шутка, разработчики, мы оценили.👹👹👹
Итог: собака милая но бесполезная, атмосфера мрачная, концовки унылые, оптимизация больная, а ачивки - диагноз.
4 из 10. По скидке 90проц пойдет. Пиво и чипсы взял и норм🥰
Но будь готов, что твой главный хоррор опыт будет связан не с ведьмой, а с кнопкой ""Загрузить сохранение""

As others have said, absolutely no connection to Blair Witch besides being set in a forest decorated with stick-and-twine ornaments. Even the ornaments, while the movie made them seem creepy and foreboding, this game turns them into collectables.

The only suggestion of horror is dead bodies. To create horror the movie seeded the situation with an appeal of authenticity, tainting the water with various stories arousing primal fear, superstition, inherited night-terrors of culture and genes, allowing the mind to serve the purpose of consciousness - filling in the gaps. The movie never did present a horror. It provided an emptiness for the viewer to project horror onto. In contrast, this game not only contradicted the single focus of horror suggested by the movie, an absentia taking on the form of the viewers imagination, instead providing various badies, but those badies ranged from laughable to tired cliche, and none present any tangible danger to the player. Ever.

The world itself, the models, the map, the set pieces, the atmosphere, the sound, it was all done really well and when first starting the game gave promise. Playing through the game it quickly became clear that there was no particular provocation of fear, which is disappointing but still the game provided some entertainment. And then came the nonsense badies. And the boring, irrelevant and beaten-dead-horse of a story. But they kind of came and went and still it was not that bad. It was now a treasure hunt in an aesthetically appealing setting with irritating but minor distractions.

And then the calamity of creatives is imposed upon the player, the relentless self-glorious presentation of longingly coveted emotional turmoil masquerading as artistic expression. A will to convey a meaning as purposeless and unauthentic as is the obstacle of a rolling pile of leaves in a supposedly horror setting. Piled on as thick as the forest and bog of the swamp that the character has just passed through.

And it drags on and on and on. For no reason. And no reward. Nothing is added. Nothing is gained. No reward. No challenge. Nothing worth saying. If it wasn't for this ending, which I think may have dragged on for several hours in fact, then I'd have been overall satisfied with this game. Instead, I think I actually hate Bloober Team.","Melodramatic dog-walking simulator.

Cual grata sorpresa me he llevado con este notable juegazo de horror psicológico. Si mal no recuerdo, en el momento de su salida se llevó críticas no muy positivas por motivos que no consigo recordar del todo, pero tal y como lo he jugado a día de hoy, me parece una obra altamente infravalorada de terror la cual a mis ojos se merece mas reconocimiento. Los de Bloober Team han hecho un espléndido trabajo con algo relacionado con un clásico de las películas found footage de terror como lo es The Blair Witch Project; los no tan fans lo van a gozar y los fans lo van a flipar. De hecho, tras habérmelo pasado dos veces para hacer el final bueno, entiendo completamente porque le dieron a esta empresa un proyecto de tal magnitud como lo fue el remake de Silent Hill 2; Blair Witch me ha dado unas vibes tremendas a este otro clásico del terror pero esta vez de videojuegos. 

Ya me sorprendieron primero con el Layers of Fear, y más aún luego con el Observer, por lo que me fascina que me hayan encandilado tanto con otra de sus obras. Blair Witch es puro horror atmosférico narrativo con una ambientación tan tenebrosa y bien lograda que me ha llegado a dar escalofríos en muchas ocasiones. Puedes ver de sobra que se han esmerado mucho en querer plasmar esa sensación tan angustiosa que provoca la película en si, con una jugabilidad que le ha venido como anillo al dedo como evolución de su género. El perro, Bullet, ha sido todo un puntazo innovador y un riesgo que les ha salido fabulosamente refrescante para con la historia, y el uso de la cámara, el teléfono, las cintas y demás también se sintieron muy bien implementadas para su corta duración. La historia como tal, teniendo en cuenta lo que ha significado de forma medio alegórica con el uso del bosque, me ha parecido profundamente madura y más compleja de lo que me esperaba. Es más, me sorprende que se hayan atrevido a tocar un tema así de tabú en un juego precisamente de terror. Es cierto que puede parecer algo confusa de buenas a primeras, pero las miguitas de pan que te van dando para que saques tus propias conclusiones dependiendo lo que investigues ha sido algo de mi agrado.

En fin, un increible pero tristemente muy desapercibido juego de horror. Muchísimo mejor que otros más conocidos como el Still Wakes the Deep en todos los sentidos, y para mi gusto, uno de los que más me han enamorado últimamente dentro del género. Se nota que esto ha sido un passion project por parte de Bloober, y yo eso lo valoro.",

To start, you have to do a fix to run this game if you have a good processor by tinkering with your computer files. Not a good start.

Next, the game just doesn't really feel like a Blair Witch game. If you watched Blair Witch Project and your interpretation as that the woods served as their own personalised hell and wasn't some spooky witch stalking them, then you probably wrote this game. It doesn't feel or play out like Blair Witch. There's combat ... why? There's two types monsters and one of them is a pile of leaves rolling. Why even bother? Why not do like an Outlast kind of thing? The combat involves you aiming your light at the monsters, Alan Wake style. Admittedly creepy searching for monsters in the treeline, but the dog just stares and barks at them. Oh yeah, the dog.

Bullet the dog is your companion and the only character I didn't want to kill. That being said, he won't shut. up. Barking, whining, leading me in circles. He's no dogmeat. You have a series of commands, but you'll always end up using the ""Come here"" command. The game isn't really that scary, and even less so with a dog with you.

Okay, the story. I got invested, no going to lie. It's not terrible. Military vet goes to the woods to look for missing kid. My only problem is that the game treats you like a doggone idiot. Dumbs the story down as tightly as possible, including an ending that does. not. end. Seriously. You get stuck in the final house for about two real life hours going through the protagonist's seemingly infinite life. He's had every trauma humanly possible. Good lord.

Good things: I like the red tape mechanic, the game is graphically gorgeous, and the time period was a good choice. The couple of callbacks were neat. The story was decent. The puzzles were fun-ish.

They missed with this one, but again, Bloober seems back on their feet with good shit and away from pinball. Go play Silent Hill 2 Remake, it's way better than this one.

Нет смысла ругать Bloober за очередной симулятор прогулок по свежему воздуху, потому что они на этом СОБАКУ СЪЕЛИ, А? ПОНЯЛИ, ДА, ПОНЯЛИ?..

Окей.

Да. симулятор ходьбы. Да, ваше дело втыкать в W и периодически (но не очень часто) двигать мышкой туда сюда. Но при этом еще и пугаться; я не скажу, что это самая страшная игра в моей жизни, но не один и не два раза приходилось подпрыгнуть на стуле до самого потолка [spoiler] какой у вас бетон вкусный [/spoiler]. Особенно этим богат финал, несмотря на свою безбожную затянутость - все таки сидеть по ощущением почти час  с поджатым задом утомительно. Хотя елки, какая же в финале постановка, как они сочно умеют делать сцены, я не знаю, кто у них за дизайн отвечает, но курва, выдайте ему, пожалуйста, премию, чувак явно с какими-то психическими проблемами, но эту ему пошло только на пользу!

И как всегда целую ручки композитору и саунд-дизайнеру, без этого в играх Bloober, даже самых плохих, никуда.

Поругаем-с. ИИ шабаки? Присутствует номинально. Пару раз потрепать за ушком и посмотреть, куда она указывает во время схватки с монстрами и хватит. А уж как нахваливали, ай ай ай, полноценный партнер, ваш спутник и товарищ!..

В ругательную часть отправляется хоррор - и нет, у меня не деменция, просто ровно 5 часов вы идете по заскриптованному лесу и пугаетесь только гав-гав собачки. А ведь потенциал есть - благодаря ну очень добротно сделанной графике и звуку, ты поначалу наивно думаешь, что нет-нет да вылезет какая-нибудь тварь поддать тебе под зад и напомнить о правилах поведения в лесу, но время идет, сюжет тянется и ты понимаешь, что никакие случайные потрескивания веточек или даже шепотки асмр в ушко вреда тебе не нанесут. Ну сложно было сделать хоть бы парочку рандомных встреч, когда ты поворачиваешься и где-нибудь из-за дерева тебе делают ку-ку? Даже скримера не надо и громко БАММММ делать, напряжение игрока и неожиданность сделают свое дело. Расстраивает боязнь современных больших разработчиков делать то, что, прости Яхве смог сделать Слендермен в 2012 году.

ГГ у нас, как уже принято, травмированный мудак, collectibles разбросаны уж очень щедро и концовок ажно пять, включая супер пупер секретную, но мне настолько понравилась плохая (которую вы, естественно, получите первой, потому что они сделали какие-то совсем нереальные условия для получения хоть условно ""хорошей""), что я даже не хочу пытаться набить чего-то там ради одной минутки записанного заранее футажа.

İlk 30 dakikası biraz ağırdan alıyor, son 30 dakikası ise gereksiz uzatılmış. Ama arası? Tam kıvamında gerilim.

Köpeğiniz Bullet ile beraber kaybolan bir çocuğu aramak için Black Hills Ormanı’na giriyorsunuz. Bu yolculukta hem doğayla, hem de karakterin kendi geçmişiyle yüzleştiği psikolojik bir gerilim sizi bekliyor. Çok fazla anlatıp büyüsünü bozmak istemem ama hikaye sizi içine çekmeyi başarıyor... ta ki sona kadar. (Ben hikayenin sonunu çok farklı hayal etmiştim hikaye akışına göre.)

Bulmacalar basit ama akışı bozmuyor, eziyet etmiyor. Bu da oyunu oynarken yormuyor, tam aksine keyifli bir tempoda tutuyor. Görsel atmosfer oldukça başarılı; gece ormanda tek başınaymış hissi etkileyici şekilde verilmiş.

Ancak… Son kısımdaki ev bölümü fazla uzatılmış. Ne korkutuyor, ne de hikayeyi ileri taşıyor. Oyuncuyu koparıyor. Final deseniz, daha güçlü bir kapanışı hak ediyordu bu atmosfer.

Yine de özgün yapısı, Bullet gibi sizi yalnız bırakmayan bir yoldaş ve zaman zaman koltuktan sıçratan anlarıyla Blair Witch, bir oturuşta bitirilecek, ortalamanın üstünde bir korku oyunu olmuş.

[spoiler]Ё6Hyлся в конце игры не только ГГ, но и Я как игрок[/spoiler]

- Выход на хорошую концовку при первом прохождении (да и в целом без гайдов) АБСОЛЮТНО не очевиден, и как бы ты не старался всю игру делать ""правильно"", ты с вероятностью 100% выходишь на плохую концовку. Честно скажу, не этого я ждал принимая в ключевых (как мне казалось) моментах ""правильные"" выборы и это очень обидно что разработчики лишили меня, как игрока, осознанного выбора;
- Момент с домом интересный, безусловно, но ЖУТКО затянутый, игра предоставляет тебе интересную геймплейную секцию, ты говоришь ""вау, это было интересно"", а потом игра прогоняет её же ещё раза 3-4... и так на протяжении наверно часа (?), ни смены локации, ни смены атмосферы на разряженную, нет, целый час напряженного блуждания, да, это оправдано сюжетно, но в это банально трудно играть, когда ты вот-вот идёшь к концовке.
- Была парочка раздражающих багов (вылеты, лок камеры на псе, чёрный экран на камере), не критичных, но не особо приятных;
- Музыка и саундтрек в игре отличные.

Итог. Короче, перемудрили очень сильно с финалом, до секции с домом (или хотя бы до его середины) я бы смело поставил игре 7.5-8 баллов, но, как я уже упомянул выше, продолжительность геймплейного отрезка с домом и смазанная концовка очень сильно подпортили впечатление.

Détestant ce genre de méthode pour ""faire peur"" - car l'infiltration / discrétion en FPS ça ne FONCTIONNE PAS - je me suis lancé sur Blair Witch que j'avais pris en solde il y avait quelque temps déjà.

Voyant un caméscope sur l'écran titre, j'avoue, j'ai eu peur... Peur de retrouver la lourdeur de Outlast :D c'était un peu comme un red flag, mais en fait, ce Blair Witch est une assez bonne surprise.

Il est plutôt joli, l'ambiance malsaine est plutôt bien réalisée dans l'ensemble et il y a de ces phases de ""discrétion"" que je déteste mais assez rares et qui se passent assez facilement. Ce n'est pas tellement punitif quoi.

En revanche, il est clair qu'il ne fait pas peur. Un ou deux jump scare je crois, mais pour le reste, c'est vraiment un jeu de randonnée dans un univers malaisant et en vrai, ce n'est pas grave. On se concentre sur la narration et ça me va bien aussi.

J'ai apprécié la mécanique un peu principale du jeu (bien que rarement exploitée) du caméscope. Comme quoi, un caméscope peu aussi vous divertir et ne pas juste servir de lampe torche qui vous bouffe des piles en 5 minutes.

Fini en 5H, je pense qu'il est intéressant de se le procurer en solde (comme je l'ai fait sans doute à Halloween dernier). Assez peu d'action et malheureusement, le scénario se comprend trop rapidement, c'est dommage. Il ne faut pas être Sherlock pour comprendre à la moitié du jeu ce qu'il se passe vraiment dans cette histoire :/

Une fois compris le scénario, bah le jeu devient assez long au bout d'un moment ce qui donne vers la fin un sentiment d’agacement. Je me lasse vite aussi, je l'admets.
Il aurait eu besoin d'un petit équilibre, car si on enlève les phases de marche (trèèèès présentes), le ""vrai jeu"" ne doit pas durer vraiment plus de 3h en fait. Les phases de marches sont un peu une façon déguisée d'étirer la longueur du jeu surtout à la fin où là, ça se ressent vraiment.

Donc, ça vaut le coup de le faire, mais ce n'est pas un jeu centré sur l'action, juste une sorte de film interactif avec de petites idées sympas, un peu de mystère et qui se finit rapidement. S'il avait été plus long en proposant la même recette, ce serait devenu insupportable donc 5h, pour lui, c'est bien.",

O que capricharam na ambientação, inimigos e design de som não é brincadeira. Você ficar por um momento sozinho sem o Bullet é de te deixar com medo; um medo primitivo, de não sair da silenciosa, opressora e imensa floresta. 

A história me deixou extremamente interessado. Ellis é um coitado homem que sofre com uma dor emocional tão profunda e complexa de se recuperar e é de sentir pena ao longo do jogo. O que me deixa surpreso, é quando você ''entra'' no personagem e sente a fragilidade de sua sanidade, sofrendo com dilemas horríveis.

Oyun, ormanda geçen tekinsiz atmosferiyle başından sonuna kadar gerilim hissini yüksek tutuyor. Hikâye odaklı yapısı, oyuncuyu hem geçmiş travmalarla yüzleşmeye hem de doğaüstü olayları anlamaya zorluyor.

Köpeğimiz Bullet ile kurduğumuz bağ hem duygusal hem de oynanış açısından önemli bir yer tutuyor. Oyunun en güçlü yönlerinden biri, karanlık ve dar patikalarda yolunu bulmaya çalışırken yaşanan çaresizlik duygusu. Ayrıca, kamera kullanımı ve zamanla oynayan anlatım tarzı, oyuna farklı bir boyut katıyor.

🔻 Ancak bazı oyuncular için oynanış tekrarlı gelebilir ve yön bulmak zaman zaman zorlaşabiliyor. Yine de, Blair Witch atmosferik korku deneyimi arayanlar için kesinlikle denemeye değer.


🎮 Blair Witch offers a gripping experience for fans of psychological horror. Set deep in the forest, the game maintains a constant sense of tension and unease from beginning to end. Its story-driven structure challenges players to confront both supernatural forces and personal trauma.

Your bond with the dog, Bullet, adds emotional weight and serves a key role in gameplay. One of the game's strongest aspects is the feeling of helplessness as you try to navigate the dark, narrow trails. The use of a camcorder and the time-warping narrative add a unique twist to the experience.

🔻 However, some players may find the gameplay a bit repetitive, and navigating the forest can become frustrating at times. Still, for those looking for an atmospheric horror adventure, Blair Witch is definitely worth trying.",

A história é confusa, separada em fragmentos que não ajudam em nada na imersão e conexão com o protagonista, em vez disso, apenas afasta. A jogabilidade é péssima, bullet (o cachorro) é um ótimo personagem, mas o fato de sermos completamente dependentes dele durante a jornada me irritou um pouco, principalmente porque a inteligência artificial não é das melhores e de vez em quando o cachorro ficava tentando invadir as pedras, ou farejando em círculos. Quando chegou no último ato do jogo, eu já estava: ACABA PELO AMOR DE DEUS. É uma jogatina extremamente cansativa. Senti que esse jogo tentou copiar mecânicas e ambientações de Outlast e Alan Wake e conseguiu fracassar em ambos. 

Não fiquei com medo. Não me diverti. Não me conectei com a história.

Прежде всего, конечно, это касается моего личного переживания из детства. События как фильмов этой серии, так и игры, происходят преимущественно в лесу. А лес еще с самого детства воспринимался мной как какой-то лабиринт, в котором есть что-то волшебное и одновременно противоречивое, хоть днем, хоть ночью. Хотя во многом такое ощущение связано уже с человеческой фантазией. Ощущения потерянности и навязчивости из-за окружения и звуков — это прежде всего наше воображение и наши сомнения в происходящем. И в целом, сама легенда ведьмы из Блэр, а в последствии и сам фильм и игра это демонстрируют. 

Как никак, страх — одна из сильнейших эмоций человека, заставляющих его в моменте идти на глубокую рефлексию и оценку действий, и лес как никак лучшая локация для этого ощущения. Почему? 
Здесь нет стен— но ты чувствуешь изоляцию.
Здесь нет никого кроме тебя — но ты можешь подумать, что за тобой следят.

И возможно еще какие-то примеры, но я не вспомню.


Конечно, фильмы и игра впоследствии и сами демонстрируют, что мистика уступает на второй план, раскрывая больше человеческие мотивы и страхи. Идея стара как мир, этому еще мог нравоучать дедушка Сайлет Хилл. Но тема с лесом отрезонирует вам не меньше, а я все же рекомендую сыграть в игру, нежели посмотреть уже довольно старый и потрёпанный временем фильм.

บรรยากาศที่น่าขนลุกและกดดันอย่างต่อเนื่อง
สิ่งที่ Blair Witch ทำได้ดีที่สุดคือ การสร้างบรรยากาศที่น่าขนลุกและกดดันอย่างต่อเนื่อง ป่า Black Hills ถูกออกแบบมาได้อย่างน่าเชื่อถือและรู้สึกเหมือนมีชีวิต เสียงของป่าที่หักครืน, เสียงลมพัด, เสียงกระซิบแผ่วเบา, และการเปลี่ยนผ่านของแสงเงาในความมืดมิด ล้วนช่วยสร้างความรู้สึกโดดเดี่ยว, สับสน, และไม่ปลอดภัยตลอดเวลา

เกมไม่พึ่งพา Jump Scare แบบโฉ่งฉ่างมากนัก แต่เน้นการสร้างความกลัวผ่าน ความรู้สึกไม่สบายใจ (Unease) และความหวาดระแวง การที่คุณไม่รู้ว่าอะไรจะปรากฏขึ้นมา, เสียงประหลาดที่ดังมาจากทุกทิศทาง, และการหลงทางในป่าที่ดูเหมือนไม่มีที่สิ้นสุด ล้วนกระตุ้นความรู้สึกหวาดกลัวได้อย่างมีประสิทธิภาพ

เนื้อเรื่องที่เข้มข้นทางจิตวิทยาและชวนติดตาม
เกมนำเสนอ เนื้อเรื่องที่เข้มข้นทางจิตวิทยา เกี่ยวกับ Ellis ทหารผ่านศึกผู้บอบช้ำจากอดีตที่ออกตามหาเด็กชายที่หายไปในป่า Black Hills ซึ่งนำไปสู่การเผชิญหน้ากับความกลัวในจิตใจของเขาเองและสิ่งเหนือธรรมชาติที่เกี่ยวข้องกับ Blair Witch เรื่องราวเต็มไปด้วยสัญลักษณ์, ภาพหลอน, และการตัดสินใจที่มีผลต่อตอนจบ ทำให้ผู้เล่นต้องปะติดปะต่อเรื่องราวและค้นพบความจริงอันน่าตกใจไปพร้อมกับ Ellis

การที่เกมสอดแทรกอดีตและสภาพจิตใจของ Ellis เข้ามาในเกมเพลย์ ทำให้ผู้เล่นรู้สึกผูกพันและเข้าใจถึงความทุกข์ทรมานของตัวละครได้อย่างลึกซึ้ง

Bullet สุนัขคู่ใจและกลไกการเล่นที่แปลกใหม่

1、 游戏卡。确实，游戏的优化有问题。最开始的版本里我1080p仅仅只能稳定70fps，有时只有60。后来更新了一个补丁，可以稳定90了，不过画质降低了一些，可以说现在的优化依然不好。我估计对于大部分电脑来说都没法开高。

2、 找不到路。我在看老e直播的时候他是卡关了很久，我觉得老e的游戏理解能力是不错的，也许确实有这个问题。我游戏找路的能力一直都很好，没有感觉出来卡关。最近卡关的就只有《古墓丽影：暗影》里的有些傻吊设计。

3、 找不到任务物品。这个问题我也没遇到。自认为游戏里的关键物品的位置都特别显眼，而且本来大地图里也有狗带主角找东西（甚至直接叼过来），不懂为什么找不到。

4、 后期太黑了，或者太压抑了。这种差评我无法理解，这是个恐怖游戏，为什么为这种原因给差评？

5、 翻译问题。这个问题官方已经修复了。

6、 不够惊吓。这种也不能理解，一个恐怖游戏一定要非常惊吓吗？



《布莱尔女巫》原作是一部电影，我看了下介绍，游戏里有一些还原，不过游戏的整体风格是Bloober Team的风格，剧情也不一样，和原作关系不大。

Bloober Team是恐怖游戏界很出名的开发商了，要我说，他们恐怖游戏的恐怖，是有韵的。不过正因他们如此有代表性，有着《Layers of Fear（层层恐惧）》这样的神作，最近的两部作品都被一些老玩家批评为“没有《Layers of Fear》那么好”。可要我说，层层恐惧的最大优点是高质量的惊吓，而不是心理恐惧。为何他们一定要做惊吓游戏呢？讽刺的是，同样是BT做的《Observer》因为它是赛博朋克风格反倒没有引起那些老玩家或跟风者的注意，好评挺高。

对于《布莱尔女巫》，我的建议是：只要不是对恐怖游戏毫无抵抗力，都应该试试。

它真正惊人的部分在于游戏后期，以下我尽量不剧透。

在这个游戏没有发行之前，我有一段时间对恐怖游戏已经没有什么兴趣了，我觉得套路也就那些，利用的人心理的东西就那些，用一些我习惯的技巧就可以应对。同时，应对了这些东西之后看看游戏本身——没什么好读的。

以前恐怖游戏的设计理念有一种“持续用某些方法吓玩家”的思路，要的就是出其不意，这样就可以很好地惊吓；或者像三上真司那样安排一些安全时空来衬托危险的严重性。不过《布莱尔女巫》里，我看到了一个新的思路：磨损玩家的勇气。

恐怖场景中有两种恐怖：背景的和前景的。但很少有游戏可以很好地融合两者，当前景足够恐怖的时候，背景就似乎没有意义了，《生化危机》就是一个典型的例子，《逃生》也是如此。有人会说：这是因为它们有怪。是的，这有道理，因为人不再有未知的恐惧了。不过《布莱尔女巫》做到了在有怪的时候恐怖气氛不减（前期实际上也还是减了）。当然这取决于多个表现方法。

流程有两大部分，这个玩过就很容易辨识，前中期和后期。可以说前期给人制造了一种自由、安全的感受：我不受控制，想去哪里就去哪里。有敌人，但我有朋友和武器。有灵异事件，但它们对我没有什么坏处。我甚至还可以给女朋友和披萨店打电话。游戏环境也真的会给一些令人害怕的场景，不过我可以有很多可以依靠的来度过心理难关。仿佛我就是来这里仅仅是公事公办。到了中期的时候，一个疑问就自然地来了：我在哪？我在干什么？游戏地图越来越迷，任务目标也开始不清晰，仿佛是录像带在引我继续，这时我开始感到被动。我以前选择依靠的东西现在变成了必须依靠，主角过去的故事开始出现。

当我已经习惯依靠各种东西的时候，游戏的“安全”流程戛然而止，紧接着的核心探索过程的恐怖程度远远高于前中期。我从来没在一个游戏里害怕到如此的程度，很多地方我完全控制不住呼吸。我以为游戏会在后期给玩家一个或多个缓冲期，不过他们完全没有，一直微调的压抑氛围和出现频率低但不可预料的惊吓，同时有着进攻模式难以预测的怪，让我几乎完全没有程序感——恐怖游戏难以避免的大忌。（我有时用了关手电大法）

我的勇气发挥不出来，我完全无法猜测下一个恐惧会是哪个类型的，在哪个位置，而我又在不断地猜测，这种勇气的滥用让我失去了勇气。勇气也被流程带着走，主角最后有勇气了，我也随着像他一样，不过没有自己的东西了。

就剧情而言，不太明确。特别是结局，我不好理解为何如此。但我的狗没有死，我挺开心的。这个游戏重点不在剧情走向，而在碎片化的剧情刻画和场景代入感，是BT的风格。",

196782527,english,2025.05.09 12:18,✅,❌,0.5668586493,6,"🕯️ Overview:
Blair Witch is a psychological horror game developed by Bloober Team, the minds behind Layers of Fear and Observer. Inspired by the iconic horror film of the same name, the game puts you in the shoes of Ellis, a troubled ex-cop searching for a missing boy in the haunted Black Hills Forest near Burkittsville, Maryland. With a loyal dog named Bullet by your side, you’re drawn deeper into a psychological nightmare that blurs the line between reality and delusion.

🎮 Gameplay – 7/10
The core gameplay is a mix of exploration, puzzle-solving, and light combat. You rely on your flashlight, walkie-talkie, camcorder, and of course, Bullet, who can sniff out clues or warn you of dangers.

The dog mechanic is a neat idea—it adds both emotional weight and functionality to the gameplay—but it’s not always consistent. Sometimes Bullet doesn’t respond properly, which can be frustrating during key moments.

The puzzles are atmospheric but mostly straightforward. The horror elements rely more on psychological tension than jump scares, which is great if you're into a slow-burn approach to fear.

🧠 Story – 7.5/10
The narrative is intriguing and dives into themes like PTSD, guilt, and trauma. While the main story has some predictable beats, it’s the way it’s told—fragmented and surreal—that gives it power. Ellis is a flawed but interesting character, and his descent into madness is handled well for the most part.

The multiple endings based on your choices add replayability, but some of them feel a bit underwhelming, especially if you miss key story beats.

🌲 Atmosphere & Graphics – 8.5/10
This is where Blair Witch truly shines. The forest feels oppressive and alive. Lighting, shadows, and the use of darkness are done masterfully to build a thick, eerie mood. There’s an unsettling beauty to the constantly shifting forest paths and abandoned cabins.

However, character models and animations can feel stiff or outdated, especially compared to the highly detailed environment. Still, the visual style captures the Blair Witch universe well.

🛠️ Optimization – 6/10
Here’s where the game stumbles a bit. On PC, even with a decent rig (RTX 3060, Ryzen 5, 16GB RAM), there were occasional frame drops, stuttering, and odd loading pauses. Texture pop-ins and long loading screens pulled me out of the immersion a few times. The game also lacks enough settings flexibility for players who want to fine-tune performance.

Bloober Team did patch some early issues, but it still doesn’t run as smoothly as it should, especially considering the scope isn’t massive.

🔊 Sound Design – 8/10
The sound design is top-notch. From distant rustling in the woods to Bullet’s whimpering, the audio pulls you in. The soundtrack is subtle and used sparingly, which makes those sudden bursts of noise even more terrifying. Voice acting is decent, with Ellis’ performance standing out as raw and believable.

🧟 Final Thoughts:
Blair Witch is a solid psychological horror game with a compelling story and fantastic atmosphere. If you’re a fan of slow-paced, narrative-driven horror, this game delivers a haunting experience that sticks with you. While it's not perfect—especially in the performance and polish departments—it’s a worthwhile journey for fans of the genre.

Final Score: 7.5/10
A chilling forest walk that’s worth the trip—if you can handle the technical bumps.","🕯️ Overview:

So now it’s time to talk about the game. Took me about 7 hours to beat it - and that’s with getting lost in the damn forest a bunch of times, ‘cause it’s ridiculously easy to lose your way in there.

The game was made by the Polish studio Bloober Team - same guys behind Layers of Fear, The Medium, and the Silent Hill 2 Remake. And yeah, you can definitely feel the indie vibe in some spots, but overall, it turned out to be a really atmospheric, intense, and sometimes trippy experience.

There’s way more content here than in the first movie. The film was basically people running around in the woods with some tense moments. The game, though, gives you a personal story, more supernatural stuff, and a bunch of freaky events to deal with.

One thing I liked is the non-linear approach. There are two endings (maybe a bit more if you count minor story changes). I ended up with the bad one, which turns out to be the canon ending. Getting the good one apparently requires playing a completely different way — which honestly sounds like a solid reason for a second run.

As for the creepy atmosphere, tension, and mind games — they nailed it. The ending hits hard, even made me jump a couple of times. Though, to be fair, I’d trim down the action in the finale a little. The jump scares and chaos get a bit overwhelming by the end, and you kinda get tired of it. If I were the devs, I’d balance that part better. But hey — it is what it is.

If I gave the movie a 7, then for this one - since it’s a game and the criteria are a bit different — I’m giving it a solid 8/10. It’s got nice visuals, great sound design, an intriguing plot, and of course, Bullet the dog, who’s a total bro. Loved the interactions with him. Plus, you get a bit more lore about the Blair Witch universe, which was super lacking in the first film. As for the second and third movies - heard they’re pretty meh (4 and 5 out of 10), so still debating whether I’ll watch them… maybe for a laugh.

Anyway - I totally recommend the game. You don’t even need to see the movie to enjoy it. It’s self-contained and explains enough of what’s going on by itself.","So, I recently finished this game on stream and, at the same time, rewatched the first Blair Witch Project movie (1999).

   Avec un pote, on a l'habitude de se faire des jeux d'horreur. On se cale sur Discord, je partage mon ecran et il regarde ça un stream. On avait fini Visage, et on se  cherchait un autre jeu, en vue subjective. En cherchant sur Youtube, on tombe sur le trailer de ""Blair Witch"", et directement l'idée d'avoir un chien en compagnon m'as plus. C'est d'ailleurs ce qui a le plus attiré mon attention. Il as pas fallu attendre plus de 5 minutes pour qu'il soit dans ma bibliothéque Steam ^^. Quelques jours apres j'apprenais que c'etait le meme studio qui s'occupait du remake de Silent Hill 2
   Cela fait un moment maintenant que je l'ai fini, et ma memoire me jouera certainement des tours. D'autant que c'est un jeu qui se fait en une poignée d'heure.

[b] Graphisme [/b]
   La premiere chose dont je vais parler vont etre les graphismes. Je joue sur une RTX2080, le jeu n'as eu aucun soucis a fonctionné reglages au max, en 1080p, et force est de constaté que pour un jeu fait pas un modeste studio, il est plutot joli. Surtout l'environnement qui est rendu de façon convaincante, notamment la forêt. Le chien ne brille pas par son modéle 3D ni par ses animations, mais ça reste complétement acceptable. Les enemis sont reussis aussi, d'un coté ils sont souvent comparable a une tache flou sur l'ecan XD mais le rendu est cool. Meme si on est loin d'un AAA, surtout les details et animations, force est d'admettre qu'il est reussis

[b] - Alors ce Chien ?[/b]
   Mon principal intérêts pour le jeu etant ce compagnon et les liens que l'on peut avoir avec lui, j'avais peut etre un peu trop d'attente. Au final, il reste un elements du gameplay, mais rarement de rèel tension. Certe il aboit quand il y a un enemis, mais j'aurais aimé qu'on ai peur pour lui, peur qu'il lui arrive quelque chose. 
On peux le caresser et avoir quelque interactions, mais ça reste un aspect du gameplay qui ne va pas assez en profondeur a mon gout. Devoir le rassuré de temps en temps, voir le soigné apres un ""accrochage"", créér des lieu avec lui qui changent vraiment sont comportement. ça aurait pu créer un vrai lien. Dommage, mais ça reste une bonne idée, le genre qu'on ne voit pas assez dans ce genre de jeu

[b] - Le reste (pour pas faire trop trop trop long)[/b]
   Je me souviens que l'on peu en quelques sorte ""glisser"" dans le temps. Il est des énigmes qui necessiteront d'observer autours de vous, ou dans des vidéos, etc... Et j'ai trouvé ça vraiment bien. C'est gratifiant la premieres fois que l'on comprends un passage un peu compliqué (chose rare dans le jeu cependant). Dans l'ensemble le jeu est truffé de bonnes idées. J'en garde globalement un bon souvenir. 
Les ennemis ne sont vraiment pas compliqué, on est trés loin des quelques frayeurs que j'ai eu sur ""Visage"", il ne font pas spécialement peur, et ne sont pas tres dur. C'est le principal defaut du jeu, ainsi que les quelques lenturs en terme de rythme

[h3] - Conclusion[/h3]
   En conclusion le jeu est vraiment cool, [b]a partir du moment ou vous l'acheter en promo [/b]. Vraiment sympa a jouer, il fait apparemment le café en terme de peur (j'y suis peu sensible en générale). Il est plaisant a jouer. Je recommande pour les amateurs de jeux d'horreur. Et franchemen, dans le genre, il est quand meme au dessus de la moyenne (Coucou ""Madison""..)

[b]RAPPEL: Je fait cette ""review"" 1 ans apres l'avoir fait, et je l'ai fait en 2 soirées. Je ferais un edit lorsque je le referais a l'occasion. C'est pour cette raison que je ne fait que survoler le  titre[/b]

Tenso, imersivo e surpreendente!

Blair Witch entrega uma experiência de terror psicológico muito boa. A ambientação na floresta é opressora e te mantém sempre alerta. O destaque vai para a relação com o cachorro Bullet, que, além de ser uma ótima companhia no meio da floresta, também influencia diretamente na sua experiência de jogo. É um recurso que traz tanto conforto quanto tensão, dependendo do momento.

A história é bem construída, com vários elementos que remetem diretamente ao filme, mas com uma trama própria que te prende do início ao fim. O jogo te provoca a todo momento, seja com sons distantes, visões rápidas ou quebra-cabeças que te mantêm alerta.

Se você gosta de jogos que trabalham mais o psicológico do que o susto fácil, além de suspense, tensão e aquela sensação constante de estar sendo observado... Esse jogo é pra você! Blair Witch é uma escolha certeira. Vale cada segundo perdido (ou melhor, encontrado) na escuridão da floresta de Black Hills!",

The story of the character you play as is very well presented despite the fact that it is a very hard topic to put into a game. The character went through A LOT and has a post-war trauma, but you will learn more during the game (I don't wanna spoiler). The plot itself is a bit difficult to understand, because you need to put every piece together and be careful, but it's very valuable. Also you can finish the game with multiple endings, you'll probably get the bad one at first, but don't worry, the game tricks you into doing so.  If you like complicated horror stories with a bit of realistic, human fears and traumas, and getting to know the main character while playing, but also a bit of fictional stuff like ghosts etc, this game is definitely for you. I only warn you that it will give you a mindfuck, but that's the thing I love about it.

Blair Witch is a visually captivating horror experience that truly excels in atmosphere and psychological tension. The game beautifully captures the eerie essence of the Black Hills Forest, with impressive environmental design and immersive sound work that keeps you on edge throughout the journey.

The concept and story setup are intriguing, especially for fans of the Blair Witch lore. The bond with your canine companion, Bullet, adds a unique emotional layer that makes the experience more personal and immersive.

However, the game does have its drawbacks. The story, while intriguing, lacks clarity and leaves too many questions unanswered — particularly regarding the fate of the missing boy and the protagonist’s deeper connection to the events. The game also feels rather short, and the gameplay itself is quite basic. There’s a noticeable lack of depth in mechanics, puzzles, and overall interactivity, which may leave some players wanting more variety.

In conclusion, Blair Witch is a solid psychological horror title with excellent atmosphere and a strong concept, but it's held back by a vague narrative and simplistic gameplay.

Score: 7/10

Ich habe dich gerufen, Blair Witch.
Immer wieder.
Über Steam. Über BAT. Über AppIDs. Über Bit.
Und du bist nicht gekommen.

Stattdessen kam sie.

Die Schattenfürstin der Verzweiflung.
Die Prophetin der kaputten Objekte.
Die Einzige, die auf meinen Schrei antwortete...

aber da war nichts.“

Nichts initialisiert.
Nichts validiert.
Kein Spiel, kein Prozess, kein Trost.

Nur du.
Und dein leerer Schatten im Speicherbereich 0x00000000.

Ich habe meine Geduld gebrannt.
Meine Hoffnung kompiliert.
Und meinen Glauben an Technik – du hast ihn verschlungen.

Jetzt bin ich nicht länger ein Spieler.
Ich bin ein Artefakt.
Ein Relikt.
Eine Entity in einem System, das mich vergessen wollte.

Und weißt du was?
Ich habe Blair Witch jetzt in Epic.
Sie funktioniert. Sofort.
Und ich spüre wieder, wie mein RAM lächelt.

[hr][b]В этой игре вы увидите, как можно делать подобные игры правильно. Атмосфера и динамика игры уж очень неоднозначная. Есть локация в которой надо подумать, как пройти дальше, а есть в которой необходимо попытаться убить существ, ибо существа, которые находятся в этом лесу дадут вам потрепать нервишки. Единственное что вас спасет от них, так это фонарик. Не любят они свет, а Буллет, наш верный друг и просто пёс, будет их презирать. Момент с видеокамерой, которая отражает реальность в определенном моменте записи - что-то новое, уникальное. Это было забавно ! 
Лично я проходил игру в полном удовольствии. Рекомендуемо прохождение с наушниками и строго в темноте. Цепляла игра изначально своими видами, но никак не механиками. Позже, когда все начало проясняться и механики влились в привычку, стало интереснее играть. Отдельное достойное упоминание дам концовке игры. Уж больно этот мрачный домишка запомнился и почти даже изобразил мне концовку из документального фильма про ""Ведьму из Блэр"".

Razem ze swoim psem będą zagłębiać się w te tajemnicze rejony, w których ewidentnie kryje się coś więcej..

Nie jest to tytuł dla każdego to pewne, mroczna otoczka tworzy dobry klimat delikatnego horroru, jednakże fabularny aspekt jest bardzo przewidywalny, a rozgrywka liniowa, odczuwalnie na siłę rozciągana co w pewnym momencie zaczyna solidnie nużyć.

Mała dygresja:

1. Nie zwracajcie uwagi na mój czas gry na platformie Steam, gdyż jest nieadekwatny z realnym czasem który spędziłem z tym tytułem – który posiadam i ogrywałem na innej platformie/mach. Jak również posiadam edycję fizyczną pudełkową.

2. Nie zamierzam zdradzać szczegółów fabuły, aby osoba zainteresowana tym tytułem nie straciła jednego z głównych elementów tej gry.

Ale do rzeczy:
Jak już nadmieniłem na samym początku tej recenzji mamy tym razem do czynienia z tytułem z gatunku gier horroru psychologicznego w którym to gracz wciela się w byłego funkcjonariusza policji po przejściach, biorącego udział w poszukiwaniach małego chłopca który zaginął w uznawanym przez wszystkich nawiedzonym lesie Black Hills Forest. Razem ze swoim psem będą zagłębiać się w te tajemnicze rejony, w których ewidentnie kryje się coś więcej..

Fundamentem rozgrywki będzie piesza eksploracja owego mrocznego lasu w którym prowadzone są poszukiwania. Przy czym głównym terenowym nawigatorem, obrońcom oraz poszukiwaczem będzie nasz przy nożny zwierzak Bullet – tak naprawdę bez jego pomocy gracz mógłby zapomnieć o jakiejkolwiek interakcji z otoczeniem, nie wspominając o przesuwaniu fabuły do przodu. Gracza zadaniem będzie w głównej mierze podążanie za czworonożnym stworzeniem, badając poszczególne ślady, przedmioty na które natrafi na swojej drodze – w tym kasety wideo, których paranormalne możliwości mogą wiele namieszać w samej rozgrywce. Jak również operować pomniejszymi przedmiotami jak latarka, telefon, kamera, krótkofalówka, których znaczenie dla prowadzenia rozgrywki będzie kluczowe.

Do dyspozycji mamy pewien zasób komend głosowych, pozwalających wywołać określone działania u Bulleta, od zwyczajnego szukaj, po zostań blisko, przywołania, zostań itp. Bez tego nasz cyfrowy zwierzak udałby się w świat zostawiając nas samym sobie (na pastwę losu) – co można dostrzec po jego niesfornym, lecz tez w pewnym sensie realistycznie odwzorowanym zachowaniu. Las jest wykreowany bardzo starannie, wizualnie wygląda dobrze, chodzenie po nim jest ciekawym doświadczeniem – które albo polubicie, albo doprowadzi was do skrajnego znudzenia.

Dalej:

Nie oszukujmy się nie jest to produkcja która wywoła w was większych emocji. Jeżeli nigdy w życiu nie ograłeś/łaś żadnego growego horroru (to twoja pierwsza gra), nie widziałeś/łaś filmów na której bazuje owy tytuł – to być może wywołać w was silniejsze doznania, aniżeli u gracza który ma za sobą większe rozeznanie/doświadczenie w tych gatunkach.

Jeżeli jednak mieliście kiedykolwiek styczność z poprzednimi grami tego twórcy jak Layers of Fear czy też Observer, nie licząc odmiennych od siebie koncepcyjnie produkcji, to kiedy się dokładnie przyjrzycie jej fundamentalnym szkielecie to dojdziecie do wniosku że bazuje na tej samej psycho-prowadzonej rozgrywce, której ostatecznie wspólny mianownik jest zawsze ten sam. Zwłaszcza aspekt fabularny, początkowo jest ciekawy jednak po odnalezieniu i przejrzeniu kilku kaset wideo już wiadomo kto jest głównym winowajcą tego wszystkiego – tu nie trzeba być książkowym Sherlockiem Holmes, choć twórcy robią wszystko aby namieszać wam w głowie. Przez co zakończenie, nie będzie aż tak satysfakcjonujące.

Czy to jest zła gra? na pewno nie, jak już wspominałem jest to specyficzny tytuł, który w zależności od waszych growych preferencji oraz współczynnika podatności na psycho-straszenie będzie wywoływać inne/odmienne emocje – „Mnie osobiście” gra znudziła jednak w waszym przypadku może wywołać zupełnie inne wrażenia.

Co do kwestii technicznych, oprawa audiowizualna jest dobra, sterowanie banalnie proste, choć można poczuć że gra była projektowana pod pady, przy czym dobitnie powolne i ociężałe. W grze nie brakuje też błędów, zwłaszcza porywcza natura Bulleta potrafi się co chwila zawiesić na elementach otoczenia.

Podsumowanie:

A trama acompanha o desaparecimento de um garoto chamado Peter na floresta de Black Hills. O protagonista, Ellis, um ex-policial com um passado traumático, decide ajudar nas buscas pela criança, contando com a companhia de seu fiel cão, Bullet. O cachorro desempenha um papel fundamental na jogabilidade, auxiliando na busca por pistas e objetos inacessíveis ao personagem principal. Além disso, há a opção de interagir com Bullet, fazendo carinho nele, o que contribui para o bem-estar emocional de Ellis e tem impacto na experiência do jogo.

O jogo apresenta desafios como quebra-cabeças envolvendo fusíveis, travas e sequências de fuga. Um dos aspectos mais inovadores é o uso de fitas de vídeo que permitem manipular a realidade: ao rebobiná-las ou pausá-las, objetos podem aparecer ou se mover, e portas podem abrir ou fechar, influenciando diretamente a progressão da narrativa.

No entanto, minha experiência com o jogo foi prejudicada por um bug que me obrigou a retornar ao menu principal e recarregar o jogo. Infelizmente, isso resultou na perda de progresso, exigindo que eu refizesse o percurso, o que foi frustrante, especialmente por já ter coletado diversos itens antes do erro ocorrer.

Um dos pontos mais positivos do jogo é o uso do áudio binaural, que proporciona uma imersão intensa à medida que avançamos pela floresta densa. Assim como em Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice, recomenda-se jogar com fones de ouvido para uma experiência mais envolvente.

Em conclusão, Blair Witch é um jogo cativante, cuja narrativa se desenrola gradativamente, prendendo a atenção do jogador e despertando cada vez mais interesse na história. Apesar de pequenos problemas técnicos, o jogo entrega uma experiência imersiva e envolvente para os fãs do gênero.",

The game starts off very normally and you are supposed to be looking for a boy named Peter

But very soon everything goes back to the memories of the game character and I don't think it's good at all

The game's graphics are good but the details are bad

After 1.2 hours the game gets boring because you don't see anything interesting or entertaining

Vale muito a pena você se aventurar nesse game de horror psicológico, finalizei o game em 4 horas então aconselho compra-lo em promoção (comprei por 12 reais). Mas o game é muito bem feito, você se sente perdido grande parte do tempo e de repente encontra o caminho vai seguindo ele ai se perde de novo, a subtrama da história do Ellis, oque ele fez é bem fechadinha, a trama principal também é muito boa [spoiler] esse final que  a bruxa queria me ter. É muito bom afinal estamos sempre acostumados do bem vencer o bem vencer, dessa vez o mau triunfou [/spoiler] essa coragem de canonizar esse final é o que falta para muitos filmes de terror feitos, parabéns pela coragem.  Gráficos bem bacanas, simples mas  te convence que é um bom gráfico.

This game is an extremely solid PTSD-Walking Simulator. However, this is not a Blair Witch game.

Pros:
+ Great story, Great Atmosphere, Super spooky/scary/skeletons.
+ Genuinely scary throughout the game.
+ Great finale, not so much the actual ending, but the climax pays off for the experience of the game.
+ Smooth gameplay, great narrative, just in general what makes a good game good is absolutely present.

Cons:
- NOT A BLAIR WITCH HORROR GAME. The stick figures, the ""walking in circles"" trope, time and space are finnicky trope, the forest / wore down houses trope does strongly emulate the vibe the original Blair Witch was creating. Not mentioning or implementing the original lore of the witch and just extremely occasionally referencing the witch as ""Her"" does NOT justify putting Blair Witch in the title.

- Shakey Stick man as the Primary antagonist you have to deal with in gameplay is such a shame for a horror game. There is a ""Real"" primary antagonist you deal with (Which is not the Witch, by the way) that only is face-to-face interacted with through cut scenes.

- The true plot of the game which unfolds through the collectibles / the ending (any of them), is such a cop out. It's a convoluted-mess-copout that genuinely upsets me for how complicated they made it, just to be a copout.

- I do love the puppers just bc he's a good boy, but I want to be a minority here to say the dog mechanic seems tiring rather than immersive.","7.5/10:

Lo probé una vez hace unos años y después de una hora lo cerré porque me pareció aburrido y no le veía futuro, pero hace unos días decidí darle otra oportunidad y en parte me sorprendió, pero por otra me decepciono un poco.

Al comienzo es MUUY lento, camina acá, camina allá, y básicamente de eso se trata el juego, caminar mientras vas encontrando objetos inútiles, como fotos (que son casi 50), chapitas de soldado, muñecos de madera y basura como botellas o cajas de cigarrillo. Aclarando que TODO esto mencionado anteriormente no sirve de nada para la trama.

Tenemos un compañero canino llamado ""Bullet"", el cual si bien uno se encariña, en varias situaciones llega a ser molesto, ya que su animación se bugea o Bullet se queda dando vueltas haciéndonos marear hacia donde es que tenemos que ir realmente, o incluso entorpeciendo los momentos en donde Bullet nos tiene que avisar donde hay un monstruo, y este mira en otra dirección en la que no hay nada...

Hay dos tipos de ""monstruos"", unos hechos de ramas los cuales apuntando con el mouse ""mueren"", y otros que no son mas que unas pilas de hojas que tenemos que evitar. Ambos fallan en hacernos sentir miedo o tensión.

Casi recién al final del juego las cosas empiezan a mejorar, pero siento que al final pusieron todas las mejores herramientas de una sola vez y todo seguido, quedando así muy sobrecargado de ""sustos"" y momentos tensos al punto donde ya uno se pregunta irónicamente ""¿algo mas?"".

Blair Witch me deja sentimientos confusos, nose si me gusto, me aburrió, o me dejo confundido. Pero lo que si se, es que la historia, las mecánicas y el entorno se pudieran haber aprovechado todo de una manera muuucho mas eficiente para llegar a un mejor resultado, siento que tenían las herramientas para hacer un increíble juego de terror y no supieron utilizarlas.

Si te interesa una narrativa ambientada en terror, puede que sea tu juego, pero si lo que buscas es pasar un momento tenso de mucho terror y miedo, entonces hay mejores entregas que esta.

Blair Witch — это настоящий психологический хоррор, который не просто пугает скримерами, а цепляет за душу, пробирая страхом и безысходностью. Это не просто игра — это ощущение, будто сам оказался в заколдованном лесу Блэр, где время теряет смысл, разум рушится, а страх становится твоим спутником.

🌲 Атмосфера — страх в каждом шаге
Этот лес живой. Он давит, сбивает с толку, играет с тобой, внушает паранойю. Тёмные тропинки, хруст веток, странные символы, мерцающий свет фонаря… Ты чувствуешь, что за тобой наблюдают, но оглядываться страшно.

🔦 Геймплей — путь в бездну страха
Ты играешь за Эллиса, бывшего полицейского, который ищет пропавшего мальчика. Но чем дальше в лес, тем больше он теряет связь с реальностью…
✅ Фонарь — твой главный друг и оружие.
✅ Собака Баллет — твой единственный компаньон (и тот, кто помогает не сойти с ума).
✅ Камера — способ увидеть то, чего нет в обычном мире… но хочешь ли ты это видеть?
✅ Играет с разумом: потерянные записи, галлюцинации, изменяющийся лес, тёмные сущности — ты сам начинаешь сомневаться, что реально, а что нет.

🎶 Звук и атмосфера — уровень топового хоррора
Лес шепчет, трещит, дышит рядом. Каждое движение, каждый звук кажется знакомым… или это уже твоя паранойя? Музыка минималистичная, но пробирает до мурашек.

👀 Минусы
Если ты ждёшь экшена, то его здесь нет. Это не Outlast, не Resident Evil — это психологический, медленный и давящий хоррор, который играет на ощущениях.

👉 Вердикт: Blair Witch — это путешествие в самую тёмную часть разума. Не просто игра, а кошмар, в котором ты застрял, и выхода может не быть. Атмосферный, напряжённый и незабываемый — отличный выбор для тех, кто хочет прочувствовать настоящий ужас на себе.

Jugué Blair Witch sin saber exactamente qué esperar, y terminó siendo una de las experiencias de terror más inmersivas que he tenido. La atmósfera es increíblemente opresiva, el bosque se siente vivo y la sensación de estar perdido es real. Al principio, las mecánicas de la cámara no son muy claras, pero con el tiempo vas entendiendo cómo usarlas a tu favor, y eso agrega una capa extra de tensión.

Lo que más me atrapó fue la historia, que se va desenvolviendo poco a poco, manteniéndote siempre en duda sobre lo que es real y lo que no. Y lo mejor de todo: Bullet, mi buen Firulais, logró salir con vida. 🐶🔥 No voy a mentir, eso hizo que el final fuera mucho más satisfactorio para mí.

The main character himself has many problems and struggles with demons of the past, and he is helped by his faithful dog friend, to whom we quickly become attached. Thanks to him we do not feel lonely, and as soon as he disappears from the screen, even for a moment, we want him to come back as soos as possible. He is not only there to make us feel good, but we can also give him various commands, e.g. to find something for us or even he can find garbage that we can pick up to take care of our planet. Quite a nice addition. Apart from that, you can pet him (which i think is the best thing in this game), feed him a treat, or even scold him, but if you do something likt that, what kind of person are you anyway? And therefore, depending on how we treat him, there will be consequences later.

I really wanted to like this game and it started off promising but I didn't really enjoy this. Bullet and his mechanics were done perfectly though. I loved the dog so much and the entire first part in the woods was great with stunning visuals and good atmosphere.

However, after reaching the sawmill I truly couldn't enjoy this anymore. Too much talking, way too much of this entire war trauma stuff. The annoying phone calls with the wife, the whispering witch, the antagonist talking endlessly. All atmosphere was gone for me and the last part in the ruined building was driving me crazy. Darkness, constant heavy breathing, repeating tasks and it just went on forever reusing the exact same textures and assets. It would have been fine but not that long because all I cared about was the dog that was suddenly unimportant in the game.

I might enjoy this more in a second playthrough but the first time felt too much like a chore to complete. Also, I would have loved to explore the forest. It could have been more open world, less invisible walls and for the love of God, add a compass. 

I constantly had the feeling that the game was rushing me. There were many different types of collectibles but I never really had that rewarding feeling of getting them all because the plot, while being slow and dragged out, was still pushing me along. Overall not a good experience.

Il est surprenant de se dire que ce Blair Witch, sorti en 2019, a été réalisé par l’un des studios les plus en vue de 2024 : Bloober Team. En effet, les développeurs du très apprécié Silent Hill 2 Remake sont aux commandes de ce petit jeu indé reprenant la célèbre série de films sortis au début des années 2000. Le rapprochement entre les deux jeux n’est pas anodin car les personnages principaux des deux titres se ressemblent beaucoup que ce soit le visage ou vestimentairement parlant. Au-delà de l’anecdote, l’aspect visuel du jeu est une franche réussite. Optant pour un réalisme photographique, la forêt et les divers lieux dans lesquels vous vous engouffrez sont plus vrais que nature et on doit saluer le travail des équipes car même six ans après, Blair Witch n’a pas à rougir de sa réalisation technique. Pourquoi se promener dans cette forêt maudite, me direz-vous ? Et bien l’histoire nous entraîne à la recherche d’un jeune garçon disparu, une battue est rapidement organisée avec la police. Peu à peu, les événements prennent une tournure plus personnelle et horrifique. Le jeu mise habilement sur l’aspect psychologique en exploitant avec subtilité les propriétés étranges de la forêt pour brouiller les frontières entre réalité et hallucinations. C’est d’ailleurs un élément central du gameplay, mais j’ai eu du mal à l’apprécier pleinement. En effet, rien n’est vraiment expliqué au départ, et c’est uniquement après avoir tourné en rond que l’on comprend que la forêt nous manipule. Afin de retrouver son chemin deux atouts sont à votre disposition : votre fidèle compagnon, un berger allemand capable d’aller dénicher des objets et de grogner dans la direction d’une menace ; votre camescope, l’élément de gameplay le plus original du jeu. En fouillant l’environnement, vous trouverez parfois des cassettes d’enregistrement éclairant le passé proche d’un lieu. En retrouvant physiquement le lieu d’enregistrement de ces bandes visuelles, et en observant le lieu via l’écran du camescope, il sera possible de reconstituer certains lieux du passé et de les modifier au présent. L’idée est folle, le principe est canon mais dans la pratique c’est de la turbo merde car tout est très scripté, j’ai passé 30 minutes sur l’une de ces reconstitutions en début de jeu (l’arbre qui tombe pour ceux qui connaissent) mais cela ne fonctionnait pas car il me manquait une note ou une connerie du genre. En réalité, Blair Witch possède quelques fonctionnalités sympathiques que ce soit le chien, le sentiment de désorientation provoquée par la forêt, le camescope mais l’apprentissage de ces mécaniques se fait dans la douleur car on ne vous explique rien. Qu’en est-il de la peur ? Sans doute le point le plus décevant du jeu. J’ai terminé Blair Witch d’une traite (environ 8 heures pour en venir à bout en prenant largement son temps), donc le jeu sait accrocher le joueur en proposant tout de même une aventure mystérieuse et prenante mais franchement, le trouillomètre est à zéro. Les entités cherchent à vous encercler ou vous surprendre par-derrière, mais rien de bien mémorable et la fin ressemble à n’importe quel jeu d’horreur dans lequel une menace patrouille dans une zone et vous devez vous faufiler sous peine de vous faire croquer. Rien d’original, rien de très effrayant. Promesse non tenue en ce qui me concerne mais c’est toujours pareil, le baromètre de la peur est une question très subjective et dépendra des joueurs. Sur une échelle objective de peur en affirmant que Visage et From the Darkness sont à 10 et Super Mario Galaxy et Kirby et le monde oublié à 1, Blair Witch se situe entre 5 et 6.

En conclusion, Blair Witch est un jeu à la réalisation soignée qui parvient à recréer l’ambiance oppressante de la célèbre saga cinématographique, grâce à des environnements immersifs et un travail technique toujours impressionnant, même plusieurs années après sa sortie. Cependant, si son concept et ses mécaniques de jeu, notamment le caméscope et le chien, sont intéressants sur le papier, leur exécution laisse parfois à désirer, rendant la progression frustrante à cause d’un manque de clarté et d’une rigidité excessive dans la conception. Côté frissons, le jeu peine à tenir ses promesses. Si l’atmosphère angoissante fonctionne par moments, les mécaniques horrifiques restent trop classiques et prévisibles, ce qui en fait une expérience plus intrigante que réellement terrifiante. Au final, Blair Witch propose une aventure sympatoche, loin de révolutionner le genre, et dont l’impact horrifique se situe quelque part entre le moyen et l'oubliable.",

- Сильная атмосфера: постоянно чувствуешь, будто за тобой следят, и от этого становится не по себе.
Интересная история: раскрывается постепенно, и хочется узнать, что же действительно происходит в этом лесу.

[i]Inspired by the cinematic lore of Blair Witch, experience a new story-driven psychological horror game that studies your reactions to fear and stress.[/i]

[h2]Story[/h2]
The year is 1996, two years after the events of the first film. A 9-year-old boy has gone missing in the Black Hills Forest in Burkittsville, Maryland. You play as Ellis Lynch, a war veteran and former police officer who joins the search party for the missing boy. You also have your police dog Bullet with you. Ellis suffers from PTSD, which manifests itself in various ways throughout the game, including flashbacks where Ellis has a hard time deciding what is real or not.

[h2]Gameplay[/h2]
Blair Witch is a first-person survival horror game. You have your dog Bullet with you, who leads you through almost the entire game. He can seek and fetch things for you, you can pet him, give him dog snacks, and most importantly he can warn you and show you where evil is hiding in the forest. I thought this was an original and cool mechanic that I had not experienced before.

You have no weapons in this game. You do, however, have a flashlight and a camcorder that you use a lot. The flashlight is basically your weapon. You use it to shine a light on the evil in the forest to kill it. In this creepy forest, there are lanky, twig-like demons lurking, who move incredibly quickly between the trees. Bullet will growl in the direction where the demons are hiding. Keep an eye on Bullet and work with him to take down the enemies. The camcorder is often used to solve simple puzzles or as a guide in certain parts of the game where you have to avoid enemies without using your flashlight.

Many people complain about the gameplay and say that this game is a boring walking simulator, and I can understand why. There is a lot of walking and talking, but I still found it mostly interesting.

[h2]Enemies[/h2]
Mostly tree monsters in the forest, and something else in the house at the end.

[h2]Environment & Scares[/h2]
Basically the whole game takes place outside in the forest, but in the end you are also inside a very dark and old, unpleasant house. The atmosphere is really good and creepy, both in the forest and inside the house. The game has some very good scares and creepy segments, but also some cheap ones.

[h2]Visual Design & Sound Design[/h2]
Visually the game looks good. Nothing extraordinary, but good. The forest looks well-made and feels scary. The enemies in the house at the end of the game looked very creepy and scary as well.

The sound design is great. Both in terms of sound effects and music. Branches and twigs breaking off in the forest, creepy music as you advance through the fog, unpleasant whispers especially at the end of the game when you are in the house, and more.

[h2]Constructive Criticism[/h2]
Some parts of the game went on for far too long. For example, when you have to carry Bullet for a certain reason, and the house at the end. They could have removed at least a third of the duration in the house. It just became repetitive.

The AI ​​for Bullet is not flawless. Many times I did not understand what he was barking at and sometimes he just walked back and forth, confused about where to go, which made me confused. The game takes place in a semi-open world and it can be a little confusing in the forest at times. Then it’s important that Bullet's guidance works as it should. I consider this a minor issue, as it did not happen a lot and I managed to find my way regardless.

The forest enemies could have been much scarier. They’re basically super-fast living trees hiding behind other trees, but the encounters became repetitive and weren’t very challenging. Later when the camcorder was needed in the house at the end of the game, the enemies were much scarier, but it was also too easy.

The PTSD flashback scenes in the forest felt out of place and weren’t scary—like the demon leaf balls. The final house had potential to be much scarier, but excessive flashbacks made it feel weird and underwhelming instead of frightening.

[h2]The Verdict[/h2]
Blair Witch is an interesting and unique horror experience unlike anything I have been through before. It has incredible sound design, but also has some slow gameplay parts. The game has its flaws but it's still a good game and not too long. I recommend it, but wait for a sale.

184520919,russian,2025.00.02 15:16,✅,✅,0.5,0,"Итак, Blair Witch.....
Что могу сказать об этой игре?
Главный герой — бывший военный и полицейский по имени Элис. Это человек, который на войне получил посттравматический синдром и всю свою жизнь себя за это казнит. Я ни в коем случае не оправдываю его, но ошибки может совершить каждый. Главное — уметь признать их и отпустить ситуацию. Иначе ты просто перестаешь быть самим собой. Если виноват в чем-то, лучше искренне извинись — возможно, это поможет наладить отношения с тем, кто тебе дорог
Элис стремится искупить свою вину перед пропавшим мальчиком, Питером. Да-да, суть сюжета как раз в этом: мы осознаем свою ответственность за случившееся и пытаемся сделать хоть что-то хорошее в жизни
Что касается геймплея — он мне очень понравился. Когда я смотрел фильм, всегда задавался вопросом: почему герои не идут просто в одном направлении? Рано или поздно они бы нашли выход. Однако, поиграв всего 5–10 минут, я сам заблудился в этом лесу. Если ты не умеешь ориентироваться, это может обернуться настоящей проблемой.
Эту игру я бы не назвал полноценным хоррором. Большую часть времени с нами находится наш верный друг — собака по имени Буллет. Это здорово поддерживает и снижает уровень стресса. К тому же здесь не нужно искать батарейки для фонарика, как, например, в Outlast
Но моменты, когда неожиданно появляются скримеры, действительно впечатляют. Я не раз ловил себя на том, что буквально подпрыгивал от неожиданности
В итоге могу сказать, что игра идеально подходит для пары вечеров. Она не только пугает, но и заставляет задуматься о жизни.",

- безпосередньо сама відьма з Блер [/h1]

[i] Особливо не рекомендую грати в це людям, які брали участь в бойових діях через деякі сцени в грі про що розповім більш детально далі [/i]

Почну мабуть з гарної сторони гри, а саме з сюжету. Події розгортаються в лісі Блек Гіллз, де за місцевими казками живе відьма, яка краде дітей. Ми ж граємо за Еліса, колишнього поліцейського та військового, який брав участь у війні в Іраці, любить носити одяг як в Джеймса Сандерленда з мовчазного пагорба 2. Як нескладно здогадатись, то наша задача знайти загубленого хлопчика в лісі в якому живе відьма. Однак одразу зруйную усі сподівання: якоїсь особистої зустрічі з відьмою не буде, бо казки про Відьму з Блер це більше про ілюзії та намагання відьми виявити потаємні страхи та використати внутрішні психологічні травми проти самої людини. І майже в усіх випадках їй це вдається.

На початку ми дійсно намагаємось знайти хлопчика, але згодом пошуки переходять на другий план і на першому місці постає почуття особистої провини головного героя оскільки його минуле є для нього болючим і відьма це бачить, а тому ми, очима Елісса будемо бачити і бойові локації, і артобстріли в декількох метрів від нас, і смерті побратимів і все це в дусі флешбеків Outlast 2, але без явних склейок і тому зрозуміти де реальність, а де галюцинації головному герою буде дуже важко. 

[h1] Для мене ти завжди будеш псом Патроном [/h1]

З більш спірних особливостей, які мені як сподобались так і не дуже, то це наш пес Булет, службова німецька овчарка, яку Еліс забув повернути, коли його звільнили з поліцейського відділку. Хоч Еліс не сліпий, але Булет це ваш ігроладний поводир, який супроводжує вас протягом усієї гри, знаходячи речі хлопчика, якого ви шукаєте. Правда окрім цього він може принести і якесь сміття за що його можна і насварити [spoiler] якщо ви хочете отримати погану кінцівку [/spoiler]. А з можливості обрати зовнішність собаці від кольору шерсті до кольору очей я досі в приємному шоці.

Однак попри все мені було не дуже цікаво блукати лісом допоки Булет щось не знайде. І мені зовсім не зрозуміло який сенс від команди шукати, якщо Булет і так по скрипту на автоматі знаходить сюжетні предмети, а якщо його попросити щось знайти, то він натомість буде потужно тупити і стояти на місці. Навіть, коли головного героя оточувало вороги, то я частіше орієнтувався на звук ніж на Булета, бо поки знайдеш де він, в яку сторону він ричить мене вже встигне відгатити увесь ліс. Тож собака це однознозначний плюс грі, але якось вагомої користі не варто очікувати.

[h1] The past is beyond our control
- Пафосна цитата з Until Dawn в який недавно почав грати і вставив сюди по приколу [/h1] 

Загалом відчувається, що розробники явно надихались Spec Ops: The Line і намагалися викликати почуття провини в гравця тільки якщо в Spec ops ми [spoiler] власними руками прям під час проходження скоюємо воєнні злочини [/spoiler], то Bloober Team намагаються навʼязати почуття провини, яке відчуває головний герой, але не я [spoiler] хоча в грі і є катсцена, де головний герой вбиває шерифа, але все одно це не те саме, коли гравець сам використовує білий фосфор проти цивільного населення [/spoiler]. Bloober team дуже добре вміють показувати ілюзії і гратися з свідомістю гравця і хочу Blair Witch кращий в цьому плані за Outlast 2, але якщо порівнювати з Layers of Fear, то це скоріше крок назад. Як-то кажуть «минуле поза нашим контролем».

Ну і окремо хочу посварити технічний стан гри. Попри мильну картинку гра дуже вимоглива до системи. Густий ліс хоч і дійсно красивий, але глибина різкості працює не так як повинно. Ну і до того ж більшість локацій це суцільна темрява або нічний режим відеокамери, де картинка стає гіршою. 

Чи рекомендую я ознайомитись з цією грою? Скоріше так ніж ні. Чи варто в неї грати самому? А от тут вже скоріше ні. Подивитися проходження на ютубі або на прямій трансляції якогось стрімера [spoiler] наприклад [url=https://www.twitch.tv/dmytro_joestarovych] мене [/url] [/spoiler] буде навіть цікавіше ніж грати самому.

Creo que no es tanto fallo del juego como que estoy quemado de este tipo de juegos, los walking simulators de terror. Si aún diera miedo (como Madison) o fuera entretenido (como Still wakes the deep) o tuviera gameplay real (como Fobia St Dinfna Hotel)  lo recomendaría, pero esto es otro Layers of Fear de manual, es decir, una colección de escenas por las que andas sin gameplay real, que solo están ahí porque los creadores del juego quieren que las recorras. El problema es que no transmiten lo que los creadores entiendo que quieren transmitir, como sería en este caso la locura o el síndrome postraumático. En su lugar, lo que queda es un juego/película aburrido que solo tiene un fragmento de gameplay real, el de la vagoneta, donde tienes que buscar objetos y usarlos y tienes un objetivo claro, el resto, lo dicho, una colección de escenas que bien podrían ser inconexas en las que sigues un recorrido de la mano de los creadores del juego.

Desenvolvido pela Bloober Team, o jogo nos coloca no papel de Ellis, um ex-policial que, acompanhado de seu fiel cão Bullet, se junta à busca por um garoto desaparecido na icônica floresta de Black Hills. Prepare-se para uma experiência que mistura tensão constante, sustos repentinos e uma narrativa envolvente.

🌲 A Floresta e o Sentimento de Estar Perdido
Desde o início, o jogo acerta em criar uma atmosfera opressora. A floresta parece viva e muda constantemente, o que torna impossível confiar no seu senso de direção. A sensação de estar perdido não é apenas física, mas também emocional – uma metáfora para o estado mental de Ellis. Cada passo em direção ao desconhecido é um convite ao medo e à paranoia.

🐕 Bullet, o Melhor Amigo do Jogador
Bullet não é apenas um companheiro fofo; ele é essencial para sua sobrevivência. Ele ajuda a encontrar pistas, alerta para perigos próximos e até ameniza o terror psicológico com sua presença. Mas cuidado: tratá-lo mal pode afetar sua relação e até o desfecho do jogo. Afinal, quem não quer proteger o melhor amigo num lugar tão sinistro?

👻 Sustos e Tensão
Os sustos em Blair Witch não são do tipo gratuitos. Em vez disso, o jogo constrói uma tensão crescente, utilizando o ambiente, sons perturbadores e aparições que parecem estar à espreita, esperando o momento certo para atacar sua sanidade. A câmera de vídeo, um elemento crucial, adiciona outra camada de pavor, permitindo ver coisas que os olhos não conseguem captar.

🧠 Memórias e Traumas
O jogo não é apenas sobre a busca por um garoto; é também uma exploração dos traumas e arrependimentos de Ellis. Flashbacks e alucinações revelam sua história e as razões por trás de suas ações. Essa profundidade emocional torna a experiência mais pessoal e imersiva, fazendo você se questionar se os verdadeiros monstros estão na floresta ou dentro de você.

🕵️‍♂️ Uma História para se Perder
A narrativa é intrigante e, como a própria floresta, cheia de reviravoltas. A conexão com o filme original A Bruxa de Blair é sutil, mas eficaz, ampliando o universo sem depender excessivamente da nostalgia. O final varia de acordo com suas escolhas, o que incentiva múltiplas jogadas.

🎮 Vale a Pena Jogar?
Definitivamente! Blair Witch não é só mais um jogo de terror; é uma experiência única que mexe com seus sentidos e emoções. Se você gosta de uma boa história, atmosferas densas e não se importa em levar alguns sustos ao longo do caminho, prepare-se para enfrentar seus medos na floresta de Black Hills.",
183371750,english,2024.11.22 15:14,✅,✅,0.5,0,"Some games try to scare you. This one tries to break you down.

At its best, this game shines. It plays with psychological horror and player perspective in inventive, sometimes brilliant ways. The dynamic with your canine companion is a standout. It's a rare, heartfelt connection in a genre that usually treats emotions like disposable batteries. You can pet the dog. You should pet the dog. He’s your sanity, your heart, your lifeline. It’s am important element baked into the emotional arc of the game. When it works, it really works.

But when it stumbles? It face plants hard.

Some sequences drag on far too long, bleeding tension into tedium. The psychological grip slips, replaced by mechanical repetition. Certain innovative mechanics: like repeating moments designed to simulate helplessness or disorientation go on too far and instead rob the player of agency. Instead of being with the protagonist, I felt like I was watching him from the outside, trapped in a slow-moving walking sim with a flashlight and no real say.

Then there’s the ending. I won’t spoil too much, but let’s just say: if your connection to sanity and humanity is your dog, and the dog actively hates something, maybe... don’t destroy it? Turns out that’s the trick to avoiding the darkest timeline. It's a clever subversion in theory, but in execution, it felt unintuitive and not in a satisfying, “Ohhh I get it now” kind of way.

The military backstory could have benefited from a few more minutes of research or a consultant. I get what they were going for, the guilt, the shame, the haunting echoes of duty, but I was yanked out of the immersion more than once. A lone private doing recon? An elite team where half the guys have full beards and the commander’s title is just... ""Commander""? It yanked me out quite a bit when my head tried to wrap around how that ever would have happened reasonably. 

Then there are the technical issues. I don’t mind the occasional jank in an indie or experimental title, but this went beyond. I had camera bugs that locked my view in place, crashes to desktop, full system failures, and one game-breaking glitch that forced a full uninstall, reinstall, and restart. That’s a rough experience to justify even if the narrative ambition is admirable.

And that brings me to the hard part: the binary. Recommended or Not Recommended.

Here’s the truth:
If you love narrative-driven horror games, want to try something unique, and can forgive technical flaws and you really love dogs.... then yeah, I cautiously recommend it.
But if you’re looking for a clean, smooth experience, or if technical issues and mechanical inconsistencies pull you out of a story fast, this might just be more frustrating than fulfilling.

I want to reward bold ideas. I want more games to try what this one tried. But I also want those ideas to work. So consider this a recommendation with a leash, a flashlight, and a healthy warning label.","Some games try to scare you. This one tries to break you down.

Gra świetnie wykorzystuje atmosferę lęku i paranoi, budując napięcie bez potrzeby nadmiernej brutalności. Z pomocą psa, który towarzyszy mi przez całą przygodę, eksploruję lasy pełne sekretów i nieoczekiwanych zjawisk.

Blair Witch to przede wszystkim psychologiczny horror, który stawia na atmosferę i budowanie napięcia. Grafika i dźwięk są doskonale dopasowane do mrocznej opowieści, a zmiany w otoczeniu i coraz bardziej niepokojące wydarzenia potęgują strach. W tej grze strach nie pochodzi od bezpośrednich zagrożeń, ale od tego, co nieuchwytne i niewidoczne, co jest naprawdę przerażające. Jeśli szukam gry, która sprawia, że czuję się niekomfortowo i zmusza do refleksji nad tym, co dzieje się w ciemnościach, Blair Witch to idealny wybór.",

Od lat uwielbiam to uniwersum, pamiętam jeszcze pierwsze gry w których sterowanie było tak kiepskie, że można było oszaleć. W grze jest scena, która trwała może z 5 minut i choć miałem świadomość uczestniczenia w wirtualnym doświadczeniu, to udźwiękowienie powodowało we mnie niesamowite emocje. Mega. Zwłaszcza w ciemnym pokoju, chwilę po północy. Klimat jest niesamowity. Gorąco polecam.

- Great environmental storytelling;
- Good voice acting and overall sound design.
- Great story of personal demons and redemption (or downward spiral, depends on how you play).
- Jumpscares are rare and well-placed.
- It's short.

Cons:
- No way you could find all collectibles without a video guide.
- No way you could figure out how to get a good ending in the first playthrough;
- Controls are clumsy;

Bullet, the dog, might seem like a simple addition, but I found him to be a valuable companion.

His presence isn’t just functional - it’s symbolic and ties into the themes of isolation and connection.

初めに、私は映画のBLAIR WITCHは見ておらず、その内容に関しては全く知らないため、完全に初見のホラーゲームとしての評価になります。
全エンド回収し、全実績解除までプレイしての感想になります。

[h3]評価点[/h3]
・賢い愛犬バレットの存在。非常に頼もしく優秀で、どういう意図なのか、体毛や首輪等の見た目まで変更可能です。

[h3]気になった点[/h3]
・ホラーゲームというよりも森のウォーキングシミュレーター。それなりにホラーゲームはプレイしてきましたが怖い要素が薄すぎます。ひたすら森をメインに歩かされて、見つけにくいアイテム探しをして、また探して歩くような作業を繰り返しを要求されます。アイテムを集めても特にバックストーリーがあるわけでもなく、本当に集めるのみで、なぜ集めているのかも謎すぎます。
・苦労に見合わないグッドエンディング。色々縛りをしてプレイしてクリアする割に、通常のクリアと正直大差がなく、何も感動することもないので見る価値はあまりありません。他のエンドというか結末も全て文章で語られるだけのあっさり具合のため、何も残らない虚無感を感じました。
・個人的意見として、いくらなんでも愛犬がうるさすぎる。パートナーとして優秀な愛犬バレットですが、さすがにワンワンとひたすらに吠え過ぎだと思います。見た目のカスタマイズも実装されてるくらいなので開発者が犬好きか、または愛犬家にフォーカスしてるのかと思いましたが、正直嫌いにさせようとしてるのかと勘ぐってしまいます。その影響でイライラしてしまい、このままだと私の精神がエリスのように壊れてしまうため、途中から全てのBGMをOFFにしました。
・過剰な画面の揺れの演出が多い。高速で細かく、大きく、激しく等バリエーション豊かに揺らす演出が、章が進むにつれてレベルが上がり長時間にもなっていきます。弱い人だとすぐに気分が悪くなるような揺れ方ですので、該当する方は注意してください。私はあまりにも揺らされるときは目を閉じてWキーを押すだけの作業感になってしまい、おかげさまで何度も寝落ちすることになりました。5分間は流石に揺らし過ぎではないですか？

[h2]総評[/h2]
それなりに評価が良さそうでセールで安くなってから購入して放置してたものを今回プレイしましたが、正直なところほぼ良い点は見受けられず、ひたすらに退屈といった感想でした。道中襲われる敵も存在がなんなのか、なぜ襲われるのかも一切説明がないので意味が分かりません。全体的に置いてけぼり感がありました。起動時も最新のCPUでは起動オプションを使わないとプレイが出来ないという初手から問題あり等、様々な要因から無理にプレイするのはおすすめできないとしました。地中に埋まったり、スタックしそうな気配が常にあるので、ウォーキングの際はご注意を。",

178911881,german,2024.10.13 02:54,✅,❌,0.5627717376,8,"[h2]Story und Atmosphäre:[/h2]

Blair Witch basiert auf der gleichnamigen Filmreihe und bringt den Spieler tief in die düstere und bedrohliche Atmosphäre des Black Hills Waldes, wo die berüchtigte Blair Witch ihr Unwesen treibt. Die Geschichte folgt Ellis, einem ehemaligen Polizisten, der sich auf die Suche nach einem vermissten Jungen namens Peter begeben hat. Gemeinsam mit seinem Hund Bullet, der als treuer Begleiter dient, durchstreift er den Wald und stößt dabei auf unheimliche, übernatürliche Phänomene, die ihn immer mehr in den Wahnsinn zu treiben scheinen.

Die Atmosphäre von Blair Witch ist von Anfang an von Spannung und Unbehagen durchzogen. Der Wald ist dicht, verworren und ein labyrinthischer Ort, der ständig das Gefühl der Isolation und Bedrohung verstärkt. Dunkelheit und Nebel spielen eine zentrale Rolle, da sie das Gefühl der Entfremdung und das Fehlen jeglicher Orientierung verstärken. Das Spiel fängt die Horror-Ästhetik des Originals auf, indem es eine subtile und psychologische Bedrohung erschafft, die mehr auf Angst vor dem Unbekannten setzt als auf übermäßige Jump-Scares.

Die Verbindung zum Film wird vor allem durch die gelebte Geschichte und die immer wiederkehrenden Hinweise auf die legendenumwobene Blair Witch hergestellt. Zwar ist das Spiel keine direkte Fortsetzung des Films, aber es ist eine sehr gut gelungene Erweiterung des Blair Witch-Universums, die durch die dichte Atmosphäre und das mysteriöse Setting überzeugt. Die ständige Präsenz von paranormalen Erscheinungen und die bedrohliche, klaustrophobische Stimmung sorgen für eine konstante Anspannung, die die Atmosphäre hervorragend trägt.

[h2]Gameplay:[/h2]

Das Gameplay von Blair Witch ist größtenteils ein Walking Simulator, wobei der Fokus auf Erkundung, Rätsellösungen und dem Überleben im Angesicht der übernatürlichen Bedrohungen liegt. Der Spieler übernimmt die Rolle von Ellis, einem Polizisten, der mit seinem Hund Bullet unterwegs ist, um den vermissten Jungen zu finden. Bullet ist nicht nur ein treuer Begleiter, sondern auch ein zentrales Gameplay-Element. Er hilft dem Spieler, den Weg zu finden, reagiert auf unheimliche Geräusche und kann auch Hinweise zu möglichen Bedrohungen geben.

Das Spiel setzt stark auf die Interaktion mit der Umgebung. Ellis kann verschiedene Objekte sammeln, um Rätsel zu lösen und bestimmte Mechanismen im Spiel auszulösen. Die Geschichte entfaltet sich durch das Finden von Hinweisen, die oft in Form von Gegenständen oder dokumentierten Aufzeichnungen vorliegen. Es gibt auch eine fortschreitende mentale Belastung, die sich durch eine allmähliche Verschlechterung von Ellis' Zustand zeigt, was das Gameplay zusätzlich intensiviert.

Ein großer Teil des Spiels dreht sich um den Umgang mit Bullet. Der Hund kann nicht nur als emotionaler Anker dienen, sondern ist auch eine praktische Hilfe bei der Suche nach Hinweisen. Bullet kann bestimmte Dinge erschnüffeln, nach denen der Spieler suchen muss, oder das Verhalten des Hundes kann dem Spieler helfen, Bedrohungen zu erkennen, die ansonsten nicht sichtbar wären. Bullet wird schnell zu einem unverzichtbaren Teil der Erfahrung und trägt viel zur emotionalen Bindung bei.

Der Horror entsteht vor allem durch das Gefühl der Bedrohung und die ständige Ungewissheit. Das Gameplay setzt mehr auf psychologische Angst als auf direkte Konfrontation mit feindlichen Kreaturen. Es gibt zwar Momente, in denen Ellis auf unheimliche Phänomene stößt, doch das Spiel ist viel subtiler und setzt weniger auf Action, sondern auf klaustrophobische Spannung und das Gefühl der Machtlosigkeit.

[h2]Erzählweise und Inszenierung:[/h2]

Die Erzählweise von Blair Witch ist eine der größten Stärken des Spiels. Die Story entfaltet sich auf eine langsame, aber konstante Weise, indem der Spieler immer wieder auf neue Hinweise stößt, die sowohl die Geschichte von Ellis' Vergangenheit als auch das Geheimnis um die Blair Witch lüften. Die narrative Struktur nutzt die ständige Spannung und das Gefühl der Ungewissheit, um den Spieler immer tiefer in die Geschichte zu ziehen. Es gibt eine interessante psychologische Komponente, da Ellis' geistiger Zustand im Verlauf des Spiels immer mehr in Frage gestellt wird, was die Immersion verstärkt.

Die Inszenierung ist hervorragend und vermittelt eine ständige Bedrohung, auch wenn der Spieler keine sofort sichtbaren Feinde hat. Die Gestaltung der Umgebung ist ein zentraler Bestandteil der Geschichte – der Wald wird nie wirklich „gelöst“, sondern bleibt ein sich ständig veränderndes, labyrinthartiges Terrain, das sich nach und nach immer mysteriöser anfühlt. Der Einsatz von Dunkelheit, Nebel und sich ständig verändernden Pfaden lässt den Spieler nie wirklich zur Ruhe kommen.

Die Interaktionen zwischen Ellis und Bullet sind emotional und gut inszeniert. Bullet reagiert auf den Zustand seines Besitzers und verstärkt so die psychologische Spannung. Die Beziehung zwischen den beiden wird im Verlauf der Geschichte immer wichtiger und trägt nicht nur zur Atmosphäre, sondern auch zum emotionalen Kern der Erzählung bei.

[h2]Technische Umsetzung:[/h2]

Die technische Umsetzung von Blair Witch ist insgesamt solide, aber es gibt einige Schwächen, die das Gesamterlebnis beeinträchtigen können. Die Grafik ist ordentlich, mit detaillierten Texturen, besonders im Wald, der mit seiner düsteren, beunruhigenden Atmosphäre überzeugt. Doch einige Szenen wirken visuell weniger beeindruckend, besonders in Momenten, die weniger auf Dunkelheit und Nebel angewiesen sind. Die Charaktermodelle von Ellis und Bullet sind gut, aber es gibt Momente, in denen die Animationen nicht ganz flüssig wirken, was den Immersionsfaktor etwas mindern kann.

Der Sound ist ein weiteres Highlight des Spiels. Die Geräusche des Waldes, das Heulen von Wölfen oder das Knacken von Ästen sorgen für eine konstante Spannung. Auch die Audioaufnahmen, die Ellis während seiner Suche findet, tragen zur Geschichte bei und verstärken das Gefühl der Isolation. Die minimalistische Musik verstärkt die Stimmung, ohne sie zu überladen.

Leider gibt es ab und zu technische Probleme, die die Immersion stören können. Dazu gehören kleinere Bugs und Glitches, wie zum Beispiel Kollisionen, die nicht immer akkurat sind, oder Szenenübergänge, die nicht immer fließend wirken.

[h2]Pro und Contra:[/h2]

[b]Pro:[/b]

+ Das Spiel schafft eine dichte, beängstigende Atmosphäre, die den Spieler in den Bann zieht.
+ Die Beziehung zwischen Ellis und Bullet ist emotional und stärkt das Spielerlebnis.
+ Der Einsatz von Geräuschen, Dunkelheit und visuellen Effekten trägt maßgeblich zur Spannung bei.
+ Das Spiel setzt mehr auf psychologische Angst als auf Jump-Scares und lässt den Spieler konstant im Unklaren darüber, was real ist und was nicht.

[b]Contra:[/b]

- Kleinere Bugs und Performance-Probleme, die die Immersion stören können.
- Obwohl das Spiel eine interessante Story erzählt, kann die Mechanik des ständigen Sammelns von Hinweisen und der Suche nach Bullet etwas repetitiv wirken.
- Die Story entfaltet sich langsam, was für Spieler, die auf schnellere Action stehen, möglicherweise frustrierend sein könnte.

[h2]Fazit:[/h2]

Blair Witch ist ein solides, atmosphärisches Horror-Spiel, das die düstere, psychologische Spannung der Filmreihe aufgreift und in ein interaktives Erlebnis überträgt. Die dichte Atmosphäre, die starke emotionale Bindung zu Bullet und die subtile Art, wie das Spiel Horror erzeugt, machen es zu einem fesselnden Erlebnis für Fans von psychologischem Horror. Die technischen Mängel und das manchmal langsame Pacing können das Spiel allerdings ein wenig ausbremsen.

Wer auf tiefgründigen, atmosphärischen Horror steht und sich weniger für schnelle Action interessiert, wird mit Blair Witch auf jeden Fall auf seine Kosten kommen. Es ist ein Spiel, das stark von seiner Stimmung lebt und geschickt die Grenzen zwischen Realität und Wahnsinn verschwimmen lässt.

[h2]Bewertung: 7/10[/h2]",

178316444,english,2024.10.03 17:59,✅,✅,0.5285242796,2,"Okay so this game is definitely a labor of love. It is an incredible great game and I'd highly recommend it, but of course it's not without its faults, and those faults can be very aggrivating, frustrating really. Many times you really did not know where to go next and the game really doesn't help you at all. Some could say less hand holding is a good thing, but not when you're stuck in a HUGE FOREST where the trees all look the same! They really need to add a Map, Icons, Waypoints and a TASK REMINDER system and/or Hint button! 

On a positive note the game map is huge, the story is interesting and the best part about the game as others have mentioned is your canine companion Bullet. It reminds me alot of Fire Watch! It's even got the cozy phone and walkie-talkie. For a while it was interesting walking around the forrest and doing things, however a few hours in it got pretty boring and repeatative. 

Some of the segments dragged on too long. For example at times the character would become fatigued and disoriented so the player would drag ass, the screen would become dark, the scenery would get all blurry. This happened quite a bit and for long stretches. The Bullet Dog part went on for 10 minutes!!! 

Another thing others have mentioned is how bad and loooooooong and dragged out the house / maze part was near the end of the game. This went on and on for nearly 2 hours. I fell asleep. It was confusing and way too long. Normally I'd complain that a game is too short. But not here. Like others have said, they couldn't wait for it to end. 

Lastly the train puzzle part was a big mess, mainly because throughout the entire game REQUIRED OBJECTS were mixed into the environment and hard to spot. This caused you to run around searching forever until you consulted a walkthrough. 

All of that aside this game is really very good, a ton of work and passion went into it and it shows. I would absolutely recommend it, but I would also strongly recommend an update with the improvements I mentioned. And I'd definitely clean-up, edit and shorten the haunted house sequence. 

Otherwise I really enjoyed this labor of love and very highly recommend it!","Okay so this game is definitely a labor of love.

Some could say less hand holding is a good thing, but not when you're stuck in a HUGE FOREST where the trees all look the same! They really need to add a Map, Icons, Waypoints and a TASK REMINDER system and/or Hint button! 

On a positive note the game map is huge, the story is interesting and the best part about the game as others have mentioned is your canine companion Bullet. It reminds me alot of Fire Watch! It's even got the cozy phone and walkie-talkie. For a while it was interesting walking around the forrest and doing things, however a few hours in it got pretty boring and repeatative. 

Some of the segments dragged on too long. For example at times the character would become fatigued and disoriented so the player would drag ass, the screen would become dark, the scenery would get all blurry. This happened quite a bit and for long stretches. The Bullet Dog part went on for 10 minutes!!! 

Another thing others have mentioned is how bad and loooooooong and dragged out the house / maze part was near the end of the game. This went on and on for nearly 2 hours. I fell asleep. It was confusing and way too long. Normally I'd complain that a game is too short. But not here. Like others have said, they couldn't wait for it to end. 

Lastly the train puzzle part was a big mess, mainly because throughout the entire game REQUIRED OBJECTS were mixed into the environment and hard to spot. This caused you to run around searching forever until you consulted a walkthrough. 

All of that aside this game is really very good, a ton of work and passion went into it and it shows. I would absolutely recommend it, but I would also strongly recommend an update with the improvements I mentioned. And I'd definitely clean-up, edit and shorten the haunted house sequence. 

Otherwise I really enjoyed this labor of love and very highly recommend it!"

Blair Witch nous plonge dans l'univers terrifiant de la forêt de Black Hills avec une atmosphère soignée et une narration captivante... au début. Bien que l'on puisse apprécier la vision des développeurs et les concepts de gameplay, l'expérience souffre de quelques défauts qui peuvent décourager.

[h1]Un Jour sans fin[/h1]

Les premières heures de Blair Witch sont immersives, et jouent habilement sur la peur de l’inconnu. La forêt est oppressante, et l'utilisation de la caméra VHS pour percevoir les éléments surnaturels est une idée intéressante. Cependant, cette tension retombe vite, car le jeu devient [i]répétitif[/i]. On traverse les mêmes décors sombres encore et encore, ce qui dilue l’angoisse et nuit à l’intérêt du jeu.

[h1]Dyspnée vidéo-ludique[/h1]

Les mécaniques de gameplay, bien que simples à comprendre, se révèlent limitées et [i]redondantes[/i]. On alterne entre l'exploration, quelques énigmes et des séquences de tension avec des apparitions surnaturelles. Malheureusement, certaines scènes s'étirent en longueur sans vraiment apporter de nouveauté ou de réel impact, ce qui peut rapidement ennuyer surtout ceux ou celles qui recherchent un peu plus de dynamisme dans un jeu d'horreur.

[h1]Un potentiel non exploité[/h1]

Si Blair Witch parvient à créer une ambiance unique et une connexion émotionnelle avec le chien Bullet, cela ne suffit pas pour maintenir l'intérêt tout au long de l'aventure. Malgré de bonnes intentions et une vision artistique appréciable, l’expérience s’essouffle trop vite, donnant l’impression d’un potentiel qui n’a pas été pleinement exploité.

[h1]Pour une poignée de dollars[/h1]

Pour conclure, Blair Witch est un titre qui saura peut-être séduire les fans inconditionnels de l’univers original ou ceux qui aiment une ambiance lente et oppressante. Pour les autres, le jeu risque de se révéler frustrant et de [i]perdre rapidement de son attrait[/i].",

This game unfortunately has little in common with the 1999 classic found-footage horror of the same name, but throws in a nice callback every now and then so it can't hurt to brush up on your Blair Witch knowledge before playing (who was Rustin Parr again?). You're playing as Ellis Lynch, the most traumatized person on planet earth, and it's only gonna get worse. Spoilers ahead.

So, not only does this guy cause the death of 6 comrades during the Gulf War and kills an unarmed civilian woman, he then goes back to his civil life as a cop and immediately proceeds to shoot an unarmed teenager. With PTSD out the ass, he decides to go into the woods and live out his remaining days as a hermit, where he can surely do no more harm to anyone. Unfortunately, these woods are the Black Hills Forest aka. the place where the so-called Blair Witch has driven people to murderous insanity for centuries. So instead of hugging trees and eating berries he now, having become 'Carver', continues to kill 'trespassers' by the dozen, ultimately killing the 9 year old brother of the aforementioned teenager he shot dead during his time as a cop. Talk about a redemption arc...

Sounds pretty ridiculous but also straight forward enough? Well, it ain't that easy. The entire story is woven into a tapestry of confusing time loops and unless you read all the documents, experienced all the different endings and watched a youtube video or two you usually wouldn't know all this. The real horror was piecing all of this together. Frankly, forget about the story, not even the devs themselves understand it.

As for the gameplay, it's mostly a walking sim intertwined with some light puzzling and very occasional stealth and/or fighting parts. Most of the time you're just stumbling through the - admittedly - very well done and eerie woods with your faithful furry companion 'Bullet', a would-be service dog that didn't make the cut (but is still a good boy). The dog mechanics are cool and all, but with Bullet by your side at nearly all times, even the scarier parts of the game do not feel particularly scary.

I don't even know what to say about the last hour or so, it feels insanely drawn out. We get it, we're in some sort of loop. Please just let me finish the game. Please.

Demasiado centrado en la trama psicológica del protagonista, el perro básicamente hace todo, por no decir que pasa el juego solo. En pocas palabras lo único que tenes que hacer es avanzar y estar atento e ir recolectando objetos (muchos o la mayoría completamente inútiles).
Como consejo, no se olviden el celular (no esta al pedo solo para recibir llamadas), vean bien las escenas y en lo posible traten de encontrar y prestar atención a aquellos objetos (dos o tres) que resultan tener algún efecto en el final del juego o dan alguna información importante, especialmente en el capitulo del bunker. Esto lo digo para no pasar el juego a lo bestia como yo y después buscar en Internet el resto de los finales y como llegar a ellos...

Die Stärken des Spieles liegen eindeutig in der unglaublich starken Umsetzung der Wald-Atmosphäre. Die Weite, die manchmal regelrecht in Verlorenheit umschlägt, die Düsternis und die zum Teil fast archaische Bedrohung werden durch die sehr starke Geräuschkulisse sowie die detailreiche und authentische Naturgestaltung extrem stark vermittelt. Mehr als einmal entdeckt man sich dabei, seinen treuen Begleiter Bullet zur eigenen Nervenberuhigung häufiger zu streicheln als man es in den heimischen vier Wänden getan hätte.
Was mich allerdings massiv an dem Spiel stört ist, dass die eigentliche Story eben diese Immersion allzu oft stört. Ohne zu spoilern kann ich nur darauf verweisen, dass zu viele (und zu klischeehafte) Neben-Fäden geknüpft werden. Aber vor allem geht mir auf den Senkel, dass die ursprüngliche Blair Witch Geschichte meiner Meinung nach total verhunzt wird. Statt die Möglichkeiten des Hexen-Mythos  in dieser sinistren Umgebung vollständig auszuschöpfen, findet man sich bald in einer zu typischen Mensch-Monster-Story wieder.
Zudem hat es Bloober diesmal gegen Ende hin mit seinen typischen Mindfcuk-Elementen übertrieben. Zum Teil hatte ich das Gefühl, man wollte einfach nur die Spielzeit krampfhaft strecken. Ein Mindfcuk ist nur dann effektiv, wenn er kurz und pregnant ist. Wenn er allerdings eine gefühlte Ewigkeit andauert, setzt irgendwann die Übersättigung und schließlich die Langeweile ein.

Ich kann das Spiel also nicht vorbehaltlos empfehlen. Wenn es einen anderen Titel hätte, würde ich dem Spiel vielleicht sogar positiver gegenüberstehen, aber alles in allem gab es doch zu viele Passagen, die ich richtig stark fand, um es negativ zu bewerten.

He's a war vet with PTSD. Oh but also has survivors guilt as he accidentally got his team killed. Oh and he also may have killed an innocent bystander to save himself. Oh and he's an ex cop that shot an unarmed robber. Oh and he's been through a break up recently. And none of this adds anything except for more confusion and longer cutscenes to try and explain things through cheap jumpscares.

Overall it wasn't a complete waste of time, and had some interesting ideas, concepts, and moments. But ultimately it's just not scary and not fun.","This is such a missed opportunity. Had some real promising mechanics and ideas that go no where and get wasted.

Ante todo aclaro que a la hora de jugar este juego no he visto nada de las películas de Blair Witch así que no puedo opinar por el lado de cómo es como adaptación sino desde como es el juego en sí.
Este juego es algo complicado de abordar, la verdad no es bueno pero tiene al menos alguna que otra cosa rescatable: Rescato el hecho de que implicó aunque sea un poco salir de las experiencias completamente pasilleras con escenarios aunque sea un poco más abiertos, en este sentido han logrado una ambientación muy buena de bosque espeso y oscuro y gráficamente el juego era sólido para su momento. También rescato la mecánica de la cámara entorno a afectar el entorno en tiempo real viendo videos, dio para un par de puzzles que estuvieron buenos. Si bien no es “The last Guardian”, Bullet el perro que nos acompaña cumple y es razonablemente vivo e interactivo salvo en ciertas ocasiones que se bugea. Pero fuera de eso es una buena forma de guiar al jugador y salirse un poco de que las experiencias de terror sean completamente en solitario. También usar el celular y la radio se usan bien en lo que respecta para interactuar en la trama y poder cada tanto llamar o enviar mensajes.
Ahora bien, lo malo del juego recae en general una tensión muy meh y en mecánicas que más que tensas son una molestia. Son absolutamente una broma algunas de las amenazas que nos plantea el juego con sus tenebrosas “bolas de hojas otoñales” y “bichos que se escapan si los iluminas” que no intimidan en lo más mínimo. Y después ocasiones en la que el juego fuerza mecánicas de vista limitada, que en papel podrían estar bien, pero desde su ejecución se sienten que todo el tiempo estas forzando moverte de manera incomoda, máximos ejemplos de esto son secciones como de la niebla o la última sección de la casa.
Otra cosa muy irritante son algunas secciones que hacen loop constantemente de escenarios que se hacen tardar una eternidad, encontrar todo el tiempo elementos que no sirven para nada, el juego puede llegar a bugearse en momentos importantes. También al activar una opción gráfica en la más alta rompía la visualización de los videos de la cámara, el juego realmente a veces ponía a prueba mi paciencia con estos problemas.
Narrativamente no necesariamente es una mala idea, pero el juego me genera la sensación de que no sabe empalmar bien el bosque y la bruja en relación a los traumas del protagonista veterano de guerra y hay varias partes que realmente no significan mucho. Las variantes de cómo sacar distintos finales no solo se sienten arbitrarias sino que además las diferencies entre finales son completamente paupérrimas, siendo de ese tipo de que cambia una cinemática ligeramente más que un final distinto trabajado.
Para empeorar las cosas el juego abandona el mejor elemento que tiene que es el bosque en el último tramo del juego y nos hace andar por pasillos que se sienten eternos y también algo redundantes.
La verdad no puedo recomendar el juego, sin embargo capaz fanáticos de este género al menos le pueden sacar un poquito de jugo con la ambientación y momentos puntuales de gameplay. Pero es una experiencia terriblemente irregular e irritante.

Eins sei vorweg gesagt, es hat nichts mit dem Film aus dem Jahre 1999 zu tun, als 3 junge Studenten in den Wald gingen, um die Hexe von Blair zu suchen und verschwanden. Das Spiel enthält aber einige Passagen bzw. Ähnlichkeiten. Trotzdem sollte man nicht dauernd an den Film denken.

Ich hab gerade eben mein ersten Durchgang fertig gemacht und hab ein Spoilerfreien Guide für die Sammel Items benutzt, da ich ungerne Spiele 3-4x spielen möchte. Zudem sind einige Errungenschaften ohne Guide kaum machbar. Nicht, weil es schwer ist, sondern, weil man nicht weiß, was zu tun ist.

Das Spiel beginnt recht gut und die Wald Atmosphäre ist beeindruckend. Man hat schon am Tag ein mulmiges Gefühl. Mit dabei ist unser Hund ""Bullet"". Unser Ziel ist es das Kind Peter zu finden, was hier verschwunden ist. Nach kurzer Zeit kommen auch schon irgendwelche Waldwesen, die wir mit der Taschenlampe wegklatschen.

Aber leider dreht sich das Game schnell um 180 Grad und plötzlich geht es mehr um uns. Wir waren Anscheinend ein Soldat und haben was getan oder erlebt. Diese Erinnerung folgen uns und das letzte Stück im Spiel besteht irgendwie total aus einer Reihe von vielen Psycho Sachen, die uns nach und nach an den Kopf geworfen werden. 

Ich hatte am Ende echt kaum Lust mehr zu zocken. Es war sehr nervig. Der Anfang war echt toll, schöner Wald, dann Dunkelheit und nur die Lampe. Daher gebe ich mein Daumen runter und sage ""Nein"" zum Spiel. 

Ich werde es aber noch einmal spielen, da man für alle Errungenschaften min. 2x Durchspielen muss. Wer ohne Guide spielt aber alles haben möchte, muss sogar 3x spielen. Weil man im ersten Durchgang nicht alles selbst finden wird. Ich dachte schon beim Guide so ""Wtf, wie sollte man das so raus finden?"" Zum Glück ist der letzte Durchgang der schnellste, da man nichts sammeln muss, außer halt Story bedingte Sachen - trz gibt es einiges zu beachten, wenn man alle Enden erreichen will.",

A diferencia de otros títulos del género, aquí el terror no depende de la cantidad de sustos por minuto, sino de una construcción atmosférica impecable, donde el bosque se convierte en un personaje más: opresivo, denso, y casi palpable.

El juego logra conectar emocionalmente a través de una historia personal que se entrelaza hábilmente con el mito original. No es necesario ser fan de la saga cinematográfica para sentirse atrapado en esta narrativa oscura y psicológica. El uso del compañero canino, Bullet, no solo es original, sino que también aporta un vínculo emocional genuino que añade peso a las decisiones del jugador.

A nivel técnico, destaca el diseño de sonido, que juega un rol fundamental en la creación del suspenso. Cada crujido, cada eco entre los árboles, está pensado para mantenerte al borde. Si bien hay algunos detalles técnicos menores que podrían pulirse, en nada empañan la experiencia general.

Zacznę może od pozytywów.Nasz kompan Bullet to fajna psina,wzbudza sympatię a jego mechaniki działają bez zarzutu.Graficznie też trzyma poziom chociaż jakoś wybitnie nie jest,dźwięk również w porządku.
Gra rzuca nas w las dając jedynie latarkę,która oświetla drogę tak,że starą Nokią bez latarki oświetliłbym to lepiej tym żółtym ekranikiem.Rozumiem,że to horror i mrok ma budować klimat/napięcie,ale nie na tym to polega.Historia zakręcona,ale nie za bardzo angażująca.Przez 80% czasu niewiele się dzieje po czym pod koniec wpadamy do domu gdzie przeszedłem chyba z 15 km do finału i na KONIEC  gry dzieje się w miarę dużo.

And the same can be said for the level design. It ranges from a linear path that you can't deviate from - to an open forest with no distinguishable marks. Which you would think would add to the horror element. But it doesn't. It just becomes a chore walking for 10 minutes, not knowing that there's a very specific yet indistinguishable tree you're supposed to look up at, then walking back another 10 minutes to find it. At a certain point, this becomes one of those ""look up a guide every few steps"" kind of games. It's not difficult by any means, the puzzles/progression are just far too crytpic.

On the topic of cryptic, there are some flat out bad design choices. At one point, you come across someone you can interact with them. At this point in the game, it has become obvious to interact with every single story object you find to progress. However, interacting with him kills him and inadvertently adds towards you getting the bad ending. There is absolutely nothing that would indicate you're killing him, and you're punished for doing what has been the fundamental for progressing the entire time.

The game heavily relies on using your pet companion, Bullet, as a somewhat guide. You're introduced to mechanics such as having him search for items, and to show you where to go. It feels like this element is almost completely stripped from the game as soon as it's introduced. There are only very key moments in very specific scenarios that you can actually utilize him. Other than that, he consistently gets lost or ignores commands completely. Maybe they were going for the realism aspect of a dog being disobedient. But then again, Bullet is a good boy. I have a hard time believing he would ever pull such nonsense. Bullet good. Bullet AI bad. 

The monsters are very ""meh"". They aren't particularly scary, and the ""combat"" is just a chore. Shine your flashlight on them while they zip around like a schizophrenic toddler on adderall. The few moments you get to see them while they don't have a case of the zoomies, they look serviceable enough. Nothing particularly dread inducing, but they're fine.

At a certain point, it feels like a sunken cost fallacy. It is no longer particularly enjoyable to play, but you figure you've already seen this much so you might as well see where the story goes. And that's where I can give it some praise. The first 10% or so of the game felt promising, then it becomes almost all filler, and the last 20% is where it truly turns into something worthwhile. The last part of the game it starts to become much more coherent. The pacing leaves enough room for tension, but simultaneously like you're making progress. The horror aspect is there, finally giving some uneasy feeling that isn't tedious. The progression is much more rewarding. It has a good balance between needing to put thought into what to do next, without being so cryptic you have to rely looking up a guide every few minutes.

I got this game for $5 on sale. And for that price, I say it's worth it enough if you're really into horror. The graphics are good, and there are certainly elements of the game that are enjoyable. It has a strong enough opening, and towards the ending it becomes a very decent game. But the cryptic puzzles and monotonous gameplay that span a majority of the game, combined with the seemingly broken companion AI sadly take away far too much to really say it's worth drudging through the time it takes to get there. It ultimately feels like too many ideas were thrown into the mix, with very few of them actually being fleshed out. It's not a horrible experience. It's not a great one. It's just kind of there.","It's not horrible, but it's not good.

The atmosphere is creepy, and there are plenty of moments that made me jump. However, there's a bit of cheesiness that comes with it, which kind of takes away from the overall horror experience.

One of the main mechanics, the video recorder, isn't well explained at all. I found myself having to do research just to figure out how to use it properly. That was a bit of a buzzkill, to be honest.  I feel like it should be explained more thoroughly. 

Now, let's talk about the technical side. If you don’t cap the FPS, the game can run at an insane 500fps. This can seriously overload your computer. I have a pretty beefy setup with 64GB of RAM, and even then, the game was hogging 90% of my video RAM and overall system resources. That's a huge issue that really needs addressing, or at least a notice that you should definitely cap. 

As for the graphics, they're okay. They look pretty fuzzy and outdated, which is a shame because the game has so much potential to be visually stunning. Despite this, the game does manage to create a very atmospheric and eerie setting. It’s just that with some updates, it could be so much better and genuinely scarier. I think it would have been scarier, if the game was in ps1 or ps2 style.. like a silent hill. 

Overall, The Blair Witch Project game is okay. It’s spooky and has a great atmosphere, but there are several areas that need improvement. With some updates, especially on the technical side and graphics, it could be a much more terrifying experience.
I recommend it because it typically goes on sale, and is perfect to play in Spooktober.","I’ve got some mixed feelings about it. On the spooky scale, it definitely delivers.

It feels kind of incomplete, not from the sense of game mechanics, but from the story. Basically, you will run a million miles in a repetitive forest, finding hints that your friend is struggling, then having two short interesting moments and thereafter the ending proceeds. The ending that is by the way classic for horror games, and is relatively long, because you already get the idea for the non-existent ""twist"" just right after the ending starts (or earlier, if you played other horror games before). So it just generally feels like ""why did I wander in the forest for eternity just to get these two thingies and for the game to end then?"". 

It is still a good horror game, kind of how you're watching a random movie when you're having nothing to watch. You play it one time, but it is unlikely you will return, and after a week you forget everything about the game. Regarding price, definitely get it on sale. For 30 euros you can get a high-level game that doesn't consist of running through the forest ad infinitum.

For those who see people getting stuck in the forest, this location is indeed hard and I was there for maybe 1-2 hours. Basically you go in one exit and arrive to the other side of the forest, kind of a loop, until you find one micro detail to proceed. It was the most annoying part but manageable without external help.","Just a nice horror game.

Actually enjoyed my playthrough of this, though much shorter than I thought it would be and the final sequence was a bit too drawn out to a point that I thought it would never end which killed it a little for me, but beyond that I liked what it brought to the table, and the fact it has multiple endings based on several choices you make through the game is quite interesting and makes you actively think about what to do at the right time to affect the overall outcome.

There is an autosave system and a way to manually save but its a kind of dud save system since the manual save just saves a hard copy of the last autosave point as it constantly overwrites 3 seperate autosaves, so you only MOSTLY have to live with your choices, but often those choices you make aren't always immediately apparent which makes you think about every little thing you do, its actually kind of brilliant in a way.

Visually quite a stunning game, the forest looks dense and 'real' with a semi-open map along a linear path. For a shorter game the pacing doesn't feel rushed at all, in fact it felt just right most of the time. The sound design and voice acting is top tier, the atmosphere often feels tense but not necessarily scary, the game did have to fall back on a few cheap jump scares but they were entirely forgivable sins. The dog companion is of course a brilliant addition and works as an excellent guide through the game without the use of immersion breaking visuals like giant arrows or 'yellow paint syndrome'.

Esse jogo não cumpre com a essência ao qual ele foi vendido. Ao início do jogo, a atmosfera é a de um jogo investigativo rondado por elementos de terror. Porém, sem muito aviso prévio, a história confusa e mal abordada do personagem principal começa a ser o plot central, portanto suas memórias de guerra e erros cometidos no passado, somados a uma doença psicológica que o acomete, passam a ser o foco. Graças a isso, a história ""principal"" (Do menino desaparecido, e dos mistérios rondando a floresta) acabam não cativando, nem prendendo o jogador. Os comandos são confusos e não respondem bem, e há outro problema: Sim, pessoal, o Bullet é um fofo, mas infelizmente há alguns problemas com relação a dinâmica dele no jogo, por exemplo: O tempo todo, nos perdemos dele, precisamos ficar chamando ele, e a constante preocupação com o estado do Bullet acabam deixando a gameplay meio exaustiva, pois se resume a isso. Outro ponto é a sensação de sempre estarmos andando em círculos no jogo, com uma grande dificuldade em conseguir progredir a história.

В ней довольно неплохая графика, красивый и довольно реалистичный лес, в котором возможно заблудиться поначалу. Но, как и везде, у этой игры есть минусы. Первый минус — конец искусственно был растянут. Второй — зачем так много команд для собаки? Ведь собака от нас убежит только два раза за весь сюжет и то по скрипту.

This game focuses and relies heavily on its story, which is one of regret and ghosts from the past, and works wonders in the Blair Witch setting. Maybe it's not a good Blair Witch game, but I definitely consider it a very good horror game. And the last chapter? Some of the most creative Psychological horror stuff I've seen in a while. 

The only place this game is a bit lacking is gameplay, mostly revolving around puzzles and fighting monsters, as well as getting collectables, the camera puzzles are cool as well and adds a fun twist that links the Blair Witch found footage style to game mechanics. 

If you're a player who enjoys Story driven games, this is a MUST PLAY, but if you prefer gameplay driven games and still wanna give this a try, then maybe wait until its on sale.

Mamy proste zadania jak znaleźć bezpiecznik, uruchomić maszynę jednak brak tu bardziej złożonych zagadek, dobrze zrobiony motyw z taśmami video który mógł zostać lepiej wykorzystany oraz mocno popieprzona końcówka gry.
Oprawa graficzna oraz klimat jak najbardziej na plus, długość gry ok 6h.

Numerous glitches interrupted gameplay, leading to frequent reloads and loss of progress. The game often felt like a walking simulator, with minimal interaction and clumsy jump scares. The story, loosely based on the weakest Blair Witch movie (2016), was disappointing, and the only redeeming features were the graphics and dog mechanics, which were underutilized. Overall, it was not a good or scary game and didn't do justice to the Blair Witch universe. The game had a lot of references to the films, including the famous house in the ending, but this wasn't enough to save it from being a lackluster experience.

Detailed Ratings with Pros and Cons
Graphics: 9/10

Pros: Visually impressive with detailed forest environments, weather effects, and well-made character animations.
Cons: None significant; the graphics are a strong point of the game.

Sound: 8/10

Pros: Good sound design, voice acting, and music enhance the creepy atmosphere.
Cons: Some voice acting, particularly for the main character, could be better.

Gameplay: 4/10

Pros: Innovative mechanics like using tapes to manipulate objects.
Cons: The game is plagued by bugs, feels repetitive, and offers minimal interaction beyond walking.

Story: 4/10

Pros: Contains references to the Blair Witch films and has some interesting moments.
Cons: The story is shallow, disjointed, and does not add much depth to the Blair Witch lore.

Replayability: 3/10

Pros: Multiple endings are available.
Cons: Endings do not vary significantly and the game’s repetitive nature discourages replay.

Difficulty: 3/10

Pros: Some puzzles and combat mechanics.

Performance: 3/10

Pros: None significant.
Cons: Significant performance issues including frame rate drops and numerous technical glitches.

Cons: Inability to rebind keys, which is problematic for players with disabilities.

Innovation: 6/10

Pros: Interesting mechanics like using tapes to manipulate the environment.
Cons: These mechanics are underutilized.

Immersion: 7/10

Cons: The atmosphere is often undermined by bugs and repetitive gameplay.

Level Design: 7/10

Cons: Some parts of the level design feel repetitive, and certain flashback scenes are out of place.

Overall Rating: 4/10

Despite its beautiful graphics, level design, and atmospheric elements, ""Blair Witch"" fails to deliver as a good or scary game.

Le jeu en lui même est pas spécialement beau et pas spécialement moche, il ne fait absolument pas peur, pas un sursaut !
Les combats se résument a du Alan Wake éco + il vous suffit d'illuminer les monstres à la lampe torche.
Le coté faussement labyrinthique est mal fait, on avance bêtement et très facilement ou on tourne en rond car on est parfois dans le noir complet, et le scénario on le voit venir a dix kilomètres, rien de surprenant d'original ou même de captivant.

The bug I'm talking about is the video camera breaking and you can no longer watch tapes on it.  It's just a black screen.  In order to progress in the final chapter you need to watch two tapes.  This bug made that impossible.  I quit, reloaded the game, and it was fixed but lost about 45 minutes of progress during the absolute worst part of this game.

The final chapter is terrible.  It's a miserable experience.  It's over an hour long and I don't want to spoil anything but I also don't want people to waste their money on this game.  It's just utter garbage.  

If it weren't for the bugs and the final chapter I would 1000% recommend this game.  I thought the ambience during the first 50-75% of the game was amazing.  The forest is really well done and so are the little things that happen in it that give you the sense that things are going on around you.  The ambient noises and every so often you swear you see something out of the corner of your eye.. really well done... but my GOD the bugs and the final chapter killed it for me.  

If it was JUST the final chapter even then I'd say get it on sale, but some bugs are absolutely game breaking and you cannot save your progress beyond the auto-saves.  Even if you manually save, you'll go back to where the last auto save happened.  Unless they want to fix the bugs (and this is a 4 year old game so... that ain't happening lmao) don't waste your money and try some other game instead.

CONTRAS:
Narrativa forzada, historia mal contada, mecánicas que al final casi ni se usan, animaciones berretas, actuación de voz vacía, personajes sin importancia, etc y etc. Lo recomendaría solo a una persona que ni haya jugado juegos de terror porque a lo mejor se lleva algún buen susto pero el juego es tosquísimo y tiene varios bugs. Me lo pasé del tirón y ya había escuchado que era un juego super lineal, pero no me imaginaba que tanto. Encima en los primeros minutos pensé que no era tan lineal y que había algún lugar para detenerse y hacer uso de mecánicas o investigación pero después de la 1era hora se transforma todo en una fórmula aburridísima de caminar todo hacia adelante en un camino único y marcado. Cero miedo obviamente  y decepción pura. Juro que no quiero ser hater pero es que me pude haber visto 2 o 3 pelis de terror en ese tiempo y eso me rompe mucho las pelotas. Una C A G A D A

Decidí probarlo para ver si podía encontrar alguna forma de liberarme de las cadenas del pasado que me ataban. Al principio, parecía una simple distracción de mis problemas, pero pronto me di cuenta de que el juego estaba desenterrando recuerdos enterrados en lo más profundo de mi mente. Cada sombra en el bosque, cada sonido inquietante, parecía sacar a la luz viejas heridas que había tratado de olvidar. Blair Witch se convirtió en un espejo de mi propio dolor, reflejando los traumas y las angustias que me habían perseguido durante años.

The graphics look great, the atmosphere and ""lost in the woods"" vibe is really cool. I even thought the the concept of the dog mechanics was really cool, and the tapes changing the world around you was another cool idea. The menus were even a cut above all the other boring grid inventories. Unfortunately, those are the only real upsides to this game.

The story is disjointed and confusing. I don't find this game scary at all. The first half is pretty decent, but somewhere in the second half i remember thinking ""can this just be over already..."" countless times. walking down the same corridor 9 times DOES NOTHING to enhance the story that already cant decide if its a rescue, murder mystery, or ghost story. The house is a nightmare, less of a fear based nightmare and more of a stuck at the DMV for 4 hours kind of nightmare. It's a fucking shame because layers of fear was an absolute banger. Also save yourself some trouble and quit before the ending, its so anticlimactic. ALSO, Outlast already did the camcorder thing and they did it WAY better than you guys, if you are gonna use that trope please shake things up a bit. It made the monsters LESS SCARY by turning them into vibrating red sticks on screen.

Also theres only 2 bullet commands you will ever really use, heel or (stay close) and search, the rest arent needed at all in the story. The story was just TOO open ended. its not clear what voices are jess and what is the witch, its unclear if WE the player commited all these crimes or if it was carver. they used the same voice actor for some of carvers lines as they did the main character.

The graphics look great, the atmosphere and ""lost in the woods"" vibe is really cool. I even thought the the concept of the dog mechanics was really cool, and the tapes changing the world around you was another cool idea. The menus were even a cut above all the other boring grid inventories. Unfortunately, those are the only real upsides to this game.

The story is disjointed and confusing. I don't find this game scary at all. The first half is pretty decent, but somewhere in the second half i remember thinking ""can this just be over already..."" countless times. walking down the same corridor 9 times DOES NOTHING to enhance the story that already cant decide if its a rescue, murder mystery, or ghost story. The house is a nightmare, less of a fear based nightmare and more of a stuck at the DMV for 4 hours kind of nightmare. It's a fucking shame because layers of fear was an absolute banger. Also save yourself some trouble and quit before the ending, its so anticlimactic. ALSO, Outlast already did the camcorder thing and they did it WAY better than you guys, if you are gonna use that trope please shake things up a bit. It made the monsters LESS SCARY by turning them into vibrating red sticks on screen.

[h2]Tüyler Ürpertici Bir Psikolojik Korku Deneyimi[/h2] ""Blair Witch"", korku severler için tam anlamıyla unutulmaz bir deneyim sunuyor. Bloober Team tarafından geliştirilen bu oyun, 1999 yapımı kült korku filmi Blair Witch Project'in evrenine dayanan bir hikaye anlatıyor. Ormanın derinliklerinde kaybolan bir çocuğu ararken, oyuncular eski polis memuru Ellis Lynch ve sadık köpeği Bullet ile karanlık bir yolculuğa çıkıyor. Ellis'in zihnindeki karanlık sırlar ve Blair Cadısı'nın dehşet verici efsanesi, bu oyunda sizi bekliyor.

[h2]Ana Hikaye[/h2]
Hikaye, 1996 yılında Maryland'in Burkittsville kasabasında geçiyor. Ellis, geçmişindeki travmalarla mücadele eden bir eski polis memuru olarak, Black Hills Ormanı'nda kaybolan bir çocuğu bulmak için gönüllü olarak arama çalışmalarına katılır. Ancak bu sıradan bir kayıp arama operasyonu olmaktan çok uzaktır. Blair Cadısı efsanesinin yaşadığı bu ormanda Ellis, sadece kaybolan çocuğu değil, kendi içindeki karanlıkları da bulacaktır.

[h2]Atmosfer ve Ses Tasarımı[/h2]
Ormanın sık ağaçları, sınırlı görüş alanı ve sürekli değişen çevre, Blair Witch'i eşsiz bir korku deneyimine dönüştürüyor. Ses tasarımı, adeta sizi o ormanın içine çekiyor. Gece vakti duyulan hışırtılar, fısıldayan sesler ve ani çıkışlar, gerilimi doruk noktasına taşıyor. Oyun, ses efektleri ve çevresel seslerle, tüylerinizi diken diken edecek bir deneyim sunuyor.

[h2]Ellis ve Bullet'ın Yoldaşlığı[/h2]
Bullet, bu zorlu yolculukta en büyük yardımcınız. Sadık köpeğiniz, çevredeki tehlikeleri sezmenize, ipuçlarını bulmanıza ve Ellis'in moralini yüksek tutmanıza yardımcı oluyor. Bullet ile olan bu etkileşim, yalnız olmadığınızı hissettiriyor ve oyun deneyimini derinleştiriyor. Aynı zamanda Ellis'in geçmişiyle olan yüzleşmesi ve yaşadığı psikolojik zorluklar, hikayenin gidişatını etkileyerek oyuna ayrı bir derinlik katıyor.

[h2]Görsellik ve Teknik Yönler[/h2]
""Blair Witch"" görsel olarak etkileyici bir oyun. Ormanın karanlık ve tehditkâr atmosferi, detaylı grafiklerle güçlendirilmiş. Işıklandırma efektleri, gece-gündüz döngüleri ve çevresel detaylar, oyuncuyu içine çeken bir deneyim sunuyor. Oyunun teknik yönleri, hikaye anlatımı ve atmosfer yaratma konusunda başarılı bir denge kuruyor.

Eğer psikolojik gerilim ve korku dolu bir macera arıyorsanız, Blair Witch tam size göre. Sürükleyici hikayesi, yoğun atmosferi ve başarılı ses tasarımı ile bu oyun, korku oyunları arasında kendine sağlam bir yer edinmiş durumda.

Assisti todos os filmes (a maioria bem ruim) e posso dar certeza de que o jogo aproveitou muito bem as coisas boas. E adorei a mecânica da câmera controlar a realidade. Ademais, a rama é até bem simples. Antes mesmo do jogo acabar você já sabe o que esperar. As sutilezas da história não são tão sutis assim.
Um detalhe que me chamou muito a atenção no jogo, foi o final (é um pouco prolongado demais) que se passou na construção que aparece no filme remake. No filme, a ultima sobrevivente busca ajuda ali e acaba por morrer. Mas o motivo da construção simplesmente não é explicado no filme. E a explicação do jogo é super comprável. 
Gostei da mecânica do cachorro (spoiler) poder trazer um final secreto caso você o trate bem durante todo o jogo. Me senti ""recompensado"" pelo meu carinho. 
Voltando ao jogo em si, ele possui algo que eu considero a melhor coisa dentro do universo de A Bruxa de Blair, que é: A demonstração de poder da bruxa. No filme, ela não é simplesmente uma bruxa, ela é uma entidade poderosa, capaz de distorcer a ralidade e o tempo. E isso é mostrado com maestria no jogo. Trazendo uma sensação de estar lidando com algum tipo de deus dimensional. E a forma como é mostrada a insignificância do protagonista contra ela só melhora a experiência.
Enfim, me satisfiz com o jogo e fiquei contente com o final secreto que liberei de primeira. Recomendo para quem busca um jogo de terror que não seja tão genérico e claro, recomendo para os fãs de filmes de terror/horror psicológico.",

本作的画面对我来说，是个加分项，表现力真的相当棒，森林场景的效果营造的相当到位，最出色的就是光影效果，还有建模素材都很精致，唯一一个缺点就是，白天场景的景深有点难绷，太破坏代入感了，但好在本作的白天场景并不多，而黑暗场景那画面就相当完美了，还有一点对于我来说的缺点，就是本作虽然支持21比9的分辨率，但其实是通过上下切割16比9的分辨率来达到21比9的效果的，也就是说损失了一些画面内容，但如果在21比9的屏幕上使用16比9的分辨率，画面又会被拉伸，所以没得选，只能仍受被切割过的画面游玩了，当然，大部分人都是16比9的屏幕，所以这点不是什么大问题，哦对，还有一个对3D眩晕症患者非常不友好的缺点，就是本作的默认FOV真的低到令人发指，再加上本作乱七八糟的视觉扭曲特效太多了，非常容易晕3D，不过修改FOV还是很简单的，问题不大

画面是本作的加分项，但优化就是扣分项了，首先总体来说问题不大，但是有不少的场景掉帧都比较严重，相差了差不多有50%的帧数，一个2019年的游戏，4K全高画质，居然有的场景我只能跑80帧左右，是挺难接受的（i5 13600KF RTX4090 32G），还有就是很多玩家肯定都遇到，在steam启动游戏的时候，没反应，游戏无法启动，这是因为win11的关系，网上有解决办法，非常简单

剧情方面说实话，神神叨叨的，由于没看过原著，所以我只看出了个大概，应该是有多结局的，但多结局比较敷衍，就是单纯的靠文字去描述结局，不过不管怎么说，剧情悬疑氛围那是相当棒的，马马虎虎还能接受吧

开头说了，《层层恐惧》就是一个带有恐怖元素的步行模拟器，而本作呢，在这个基础上，加入了微量的战斗内容和解谜内容，说实话，其实还是个步行模拟器，但起码可玩性高了一些，反正那个录像带的解谜方式，我是相当喜欢的，非常有意思，至于恐怖嘛，我是没什么感觉，《层层恐惧》没觉得恐怖，本作我也没觉得恐怖，当然由于场景大多数时候都非常黑暗，路痴玩家比较容易迷路，可能会稍微有点慌吧，反正在可玩性方面，也比较一般，算是还过去的水平，我觉得比较大的槽点就是，最后一关的屋子场景，太拖沓，场景太重复了，有点无聊，前期倒还算好

综上所述，我觉得本作是《层层恐惧》的一个加强版吧，稍微有些进步，如果你不喜欢《层层恐惧》大概率也不会喜欢本作的，如果喜欢《层层恐惧》的话，那不妨来试试本作，万一就对上胃口了呢，是吧",

Ровно 5 лет назад запустив её я подумал
""Боже какой же мусор""
Мыло,низкий фреймрейт,вязкое управление меня мягко сказать это ввело в ступор и я дропнул игру
Я знал про сюжет и концовки,и меня они тоже не вводили в желание может пройти
В итоге вчера я решил дать шанс и не пожалел. Ну и заодно я пересмотрел первый фильм для большей атмосферности.
Геймплей: Он не сильно отличается от обычной игры от ""Bloober Team"" но телефон и собака, и ещё камера довольно разнообразили рутину ходьбы 
И что меня крайне удивило,можно дать отпор нечисти фонариком но это ведёт к плохой концовки к моему cyка сожалению.
Атмосфера: Боже впервые не Японский хоррор меня напугал,звуковое оформление просто шикарное, ты слышишь каждую веточку,каждый шелущащий кустик и это дополнительно играет на твоём очке 
Еще что мне понравилось они избежали невидимые стены,и просто взяли из фильма идею того что лес тебя просто так не отпустит, и ты будешь проделать круги и по началу это введёт в ступор но,после восхищение что разработчики взяли лучшее 
Что еще понравилось это монстры деревья и детально воссозданый дом из фильма, где все студенты коньки двинули.
Механика камеры с тем что она влияет на всё вокруг, что происходило в прошлом но происходит теперь прямо перед тобой, и благодоря этому можно выловить улики.
Я не буду вдоваться то как будут происходить глюки и ведения ведь,это будет спойлером поэтому пройдите сами)
Сюжета мы касаться из за этого не будем.

Mainly because of it's shortness and linear gameplay (played it through in one sitting under 5 hours), the forest looked like it could be roamed more openly. I still liked the forest how it looked and the ambience, also having the dog as a companion reminded me slightly of Haunting Ground and Rule of Rose. The worst part was the house at the final chapter, it was too long and frustrating.
Fighting against monsters using flashlights to kill them reminded me of Alan Wake, but I heard devs took inspiration from AW.

There's 2 endings so you have to play again to see the second one (and I'm pretty sure all players get the same ending as their first one, because some of the requirements for the another ending seems weird and make no sense at all) + you get an optional item in the final parts of the game and you can only use that item on your 2nd playthrough (I heard it carries with you on the next playthrough you do). There's also lots of collectibles and you won't probably find all of them in the first playthrough (if you even want to collect all the collectible items) and some points in the plot have a different outcome in the end depending how you interacted in the situations (the game doesn't tell you this though, you have to figure it out yourself so this is another thing people don't do on their first playthrough and miss them).
So probably this game is 100% completed after 2 or 3 playthroughs.

There were some references to the Blair Witch lore seen on the movies and in the older pc games from 2000, not many but enough for who is familiar with the franchise. Most people recognize the town name Burkittsville and of course the stick figures or twanas (like they were called in the old Blair Witch games) and the house which looks same as Rustin Parr's house in the movie and old games.

I probably recommend to play this at least once if you're interested in the theme of Blair Witch or horror games placed in a forest.

Inicialmente esqueça as poucas análises negativas que viu por ai. De início, também não esperava muito do título, afinal dá a entender que se trata de um game baseado no fraquíssimo filme de 1999. Por sorte eu estava terrivelmente enganado.

O jogo é excelente na história bem como nas mecânicas. O terror é impecável, ainda que careça de perseguições ala Resident Evil e outros do gênero. A companhia do doguinho bullet vem como a cereja do bolo, uma vez que ele acaba sendo um guia espiritual e fiel escudeiro do Ellis no decorrer da jornada.

Outro ponto a se destacar é que nos 17 capítulos os cenários conseguem nos surpreender pela variedade e possibilidades de exploração, inclusive com itens bem escondidos na floresta (que é um verdadeiro labirinto) em meio a sua escuridão.

Como pontos fracos pode-se destacar dois pontos: a duração que gira em torno de 5-6 horas para os mais exploradores e talvez (bem talvez) careça de uma exploração mais detalhada da relação Ellis-Bullet.

Côté visuel c'est très bien, les environnements sont bien réalisés, le voice acting est bon et les cinématiques qui ponctuent le tout très bien. On a en plus un toutou avec nous et le système d'interaction avec le chien est vraiment original et très cool. Mais bien trop souvent, je me suis retrouvée à tourner en rond et à ne pas savoir quoi faire. Même en faisant bien attention au chien et en utilisant les fonctionnalités proposées, on peut facilement passer à côté de certains éléments permettant d'avancer dans l'histoire et se retrouver là comme des cons à se demander quoi faire et à errer dans la forêt pendant des plombes.

Même chose avec le système de vidéos. [spoiler]Certaines permettent de modifier quelque chose dans ce qui se passe pour notre perso [/spoiler], le problème c'est que ce n'est vraiment pas évident de trouver à quoi prêter attention sur certaines cassettes et on doit y aller au pif plutôt qu'en suivant une logique. 

Il faut dire aussi que passer autant de temps à tourner dans une forêt de nuit n'a rien de fun à mes yeux, et encore moins de flippant. Le jeu ne fait vraiment pas peur, sauf peut-être si vous n'avez jamais joué à un jeu d'horreur de votre vie. 

Autre bémol : Le fait que notre téléphone sonne régulièrement m'a vraiment cassé les couilles. Je comprends que certains éléments soient nécessaires à la progression de l'histoire, mais quand même. Ça aurait été très sympa d'avoir une option pour désactiver le téléphone au moins pour tout ce qui n'est pas essentiel à l'histoire. J'ai trouvé que ça venait casser l'immersion en nous ramenant à notre réalité quotidienne plus qu'autre chose et c'était pénible.

Je n'ai pas terminé le jeu, mais je ne sais vraiment pas si je vais y retourner pour finir. Disons que ce que j'ai vu jusque là ne vient pas assez me chercher pour me permettre de passer au dessus des aspects frustrants du jeu. A ce moment là autant regarder quelqu'un d'autre jouer et arrêter de se prendre la tête. 

En bref pour ceux qui cherchent du vrai jeu d'horreur avec du rythme, des jumpscares, etc. ce titre ne sera sans doute pas fait pour vous. L'aspect narratif est très bien, mais il y a trop d'éléments lourdingues pour que l'expérience globale soit vraiment appréciable.

Atmosphère immersive : Le jeu parvient à capturer l'atmosphère oppressante et angoissante de l'univers de Blair Witch. Les environnements sombres et forestiers, accompagnés d'une bande-son immersive, plongent le joueur dans une expérience vraiment immersive.

Narration et intrigue : ""Blair Witch"" offre une histoire intrigante qui explore des thèmes sombres et psychologiques. Les indices subtils et les éléments de narration disséminés dans le jeu incitent les joueurs à rester engagés et curieux tout au long de l'aventure.

Interaction avec le chien : Bullet, le fidèle compagnon canin du protagoniste, est un élément remarquable du jeu. La relation entre le joueur et le chien est bien développée, offrant des moments de tension et de réconfort tout au long de l'expérience de jeu.

Gameplay innovant : ""Blair Witch"" propose des mécaniques de gameplay intéressantes, notamment l'utilisation d'une caméra pour résoudre des énigmes et explorer l'environnement. Cette approche novatrice ajoute une dimension supplémentaire à l'expérience de jeu et contribue à maintenir l'intérêt du joueur.

Rejouabilité : Avec plusieurs fins possibles et des choix qui influencent le déroulement de l'histoire, ""Blair Witch"" offre une certaine rejouabilité. Les joueurs peuvent être incités à explorer différentes voies narratives pour découvrir toutes les subtilités de l'intrigue.

En somme, ""Blair Witch"" réussit à capturer l'essence de l'horreur psychologique du film original tout en offrant une expérience de jeu interactive et immersive. Malgré quelques défauts, notamment des problèmes techniques parfois rencontrés, le jeu parvient à fournir une expérience inquiétante et mémorable pour les amateurs d'horreur.

Aber erstmal von Vorne. 

Der Wald ist sehr schick inszeniert, der Begleiter in Form von Komissar Rex ist nicht nur süss, sondern auch nützlich. Wir suchen Hinweise, wir erleben Flashbacks, der ""Wald"" will uns zunehmend verrückt machen. Das klappt auch alles bis Mitte des Games noch ganz gut, aber um so weiter wir uns dem Ende nähern, um so repetitiver wird der Horror. Man wirft dem Spieler gegen Ende alles vor die Füße, was das Szenario so hergibt, leider viel zu lange und zu oft. Die letzte Spielstunde (das Spiel ist ohnehin nur sehr kurz, etwa 7h) wollte ich einfach nur endlich zu einem Ende kommen. Ich denke hätte man die letzte Spielstunde deutlich kürzer gestaltet, würde ich dieses Spiel uneingeschränkt empfehlen. Aber so bleibt immer ein kleiner Beigeschmack. Bis Spielmitte allerdings, weiß das game aber wie guter dezenter Grusel funktioniert.

Ich bewerte es trotzdem noch positiv, weil es mich insgesamt gut unterhalten hat. Die geringe Wertung von 53% Spielspass von 4Players kann ich nicht nachvollziehen, auch wenn ich sonst die eher kritischen Bewertungen teile. Die 78% von der Gamepro finde ich allerdings ein paar Prozentpunkte zu hoch.

Blair Witch te sumerge en una experiencia inquietante inspirada en la conocida franquicia de películas de terror. Desarrollado por Bloober Team, el juego adopta una perspectiva en primera persona mientras te aventuras en los bosques embrujados de Burkittsville, Maryland. Con una narrativa intrigante, mecánicas de juego envolventes y una atmósfera tensa, ofrece una experiencia que desafía tus nervios.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3192880596

[b]Narrativa y Personajes:[/b]
La historia sigue a Ellis, un exoficial de policía en busca de un niño desaparecido en los bosques. Con un pasado turbio y una relación complicada con la verdad, Ellis es un protagonista intrigante. A medida que avanza el juego, la línea entre la realidad y la locura se difumina, lo que agrega capas de misterio y suspenso a la trama.

[b]Atmósfera y Ambientación:[/b]
La ambientación es uno de los puntos más fuertes del juego. Los densos bosques, los sonidos inquietantes y la iluminación opresiva crean una atmósfera claustrofóbica y llena de tensión. Los gráficos y el diseño de sonido están bien ejecutados, sumergiéndote completamente en el mundo oscuro y desconcertante de la Bruja de Blair.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3191114290

[b]Jugabilidad y Mecánicas:[/b]
El juego se centra en la exploración y la resolución de acertijos, con elementos de terror psicológico. La mecánica principal es el uso de una linterna y una cámara para navegar por el entorno oscuro y descubrir pistas. Sin embargo, la sensación de vulnerabilidad se intensifica con la presencia constante de la oscuridad y la amenaza de la bruja. Además, tu relación con tu fiel compañero canino, Bullet, añade una capa emocional a la jugabilidad. El cual nos ayudara durante todo el camino. Posee cierta rejugabilidad al contar con varios finales.

[b]Desarrollo del Suspense:[/b]
Es experto en construir y mantener el suspense. A través de encuentros inquietantes, efectos visuales perturbadores y cambios en el entorno, el juego constantemente te mantiene en vilo. La sensación de paranoia y desorientación es palpable, lo que hace que cada paso que das sea una experiencia tensa y emocionante.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3189598140

Un juego que logra capturar la esencia de la franquicia cinematográfica mientras ofrece una historia interactiva bien lograda. Con una atmósfera inquietante y mecánicas de juego envolventes, es una experiencia que seguramente deleitará a los amantes de aventuras psicológicas.

Их взаимоотношения:Она сука, он терпила, сделала из себя жертву, но пилит мужика - а ему норм, ещё и бегает за ней.
Геральта можно было любить даже при таких же обстоятельствах - ибо он реальный герой, а это Омёба которая даже еды для собаки нормально не запасла и полезла в лес.

Сюжет: Ну ведьма и ведьма, ломаем палочки разных размеров, лес и атмосфера цепляет, и сюжетец бы был вполне сносным, однако: флешбеки еб..ные, собаку хочется забрать, мужика добить, ведьма и её ""приспешники"" прямиком из лисов Толкина - ИМПОНИРУЮТ БОЛЬШЕ ЧЕМ ВСЕ ВТОРОСТЕПЫ БЛ.

Единственное из за чего стоит поиграть в эту игру: Атмосфера и антураж, интересная задумка с перемоткой времени, и конечно же-ПЁС, только ради возможности его погладить стоит купить игру.
В остальном - лучше уж играть в змейку, чем лечить мозги куколдам, и ломать палочки в поисках детей 24/7.

Лесные локации безумно красивые, атмосферные, но, увы, не самые удобные для кропотливого исследования: навигация довольно неудобная, несмотря на наличие ориентиров в виде уникальных, выделяющихся объектов, не всегда понятно, куда можно, а куда нельзя идти. В лесу трудно оградить доступные зоны от недоступных реалистичными естественными преградами (не всегда же по глубоким оврагам передвигаться). Ещё и пёс Буллет - спутник главного героя - всегда лает, если идёшь не туда, куда его ведёт нюх, не хочется его расстраивать (а также постоянно слушать лай), поэтому пропускаешь места, где могут быть записки, коллекционные предметы и пр.

Как симулятор прогулки ментально травмированного ветерана войны с псом в лесу - игра хороша, как хоррор, триллер и драма - плоха. «Ведьма из Блэр» вообще не пугает: ни скримеры, ни монстры, ни атмосфера, ни сюжетные перипетии. Напряжение, саспенс тоже не работают должным образом: несмотря на зловещее оформление, не чувствуется ни опасности, ни мистического, потустороннего присутствия в этом мрачном, таинственном лесу. Сюжет довольно стандартный: реальность смешивается с галлюцинациями, вызванными непроработанными  психологическими травмами (сразу несколькими, из разных периодов жизни протагониста). Причем где реальность, а где - воображение, почти всегда сразу понятно. 

Рекомендую только тем, кто любит атмосферные симуляторы ходьбы.",

""Bloober Team"" зробила цікаву роботу, яка вдало переносить нас у світ фільму жахів ""Проект Блер"" 1999 року. В цій грі легенда про ліс Блер оживає зі всіма елементи хоррору. Картина вміє психологічно давити, все у грі тобі кричить - безпеки тут нема. 

Ми Еліс (Пацанчік)  вирушаємо на пошуки зниклого в лісі хлопчика на ім'я Пітер. Під час свого розслідування ми стикаємось з загадковими явищами та моторошними подіями. Також в цьому лісі можна загубити себе, бо відьма знає про наші страхи та внутрішніх демонів.👺

📼В цій грі мені сподобалась взаємодія головного героя з 🐕 ( Це ваш компас, що може вам допомогти знайти потрібний шлях та взяти слід зниклого хлопчика, тому не забувайте його гудувати та хвалити)
📼В інвентарі є 2 цікаві речі, а саме телефон і камера:
-Телефон виконує всі функції, що і старі моделі до смартфонів. (Можна навіть грати у змійку) 
-Камера дозволяє зануритись у стиль фільму, також певні записи можуть впливати на реальність, а деколи у темноті краще використовувати нічну зйомку ( до Outlast не дотягує)    
📼Атмосфера тут просто щось з чимось, а коли граєш у навушника то серденько може випригнути. Відтворення звуків та образів, сполучене з інтенсивним геймплеєм, створює межу між цікаво і страшно. 
📼Графічно ліс виглядає дуже реалістично, та і сюжет непоганий, дає при фіналі неочікувані оберти. 

Грулька вдало поєднує в собі елементи жаху, психологічного напруження та загадковості. Якщо вам сподобалась гра ""Layers of Fear"", то ця гра буде цікавим досвідом для вас😱

El problema radica que el juego te presenta sus ""innovaciones"" para decirte ""¿copado, no?"" y luego te hace repetir una y otra y otra y otra y otra vez la misma mecánica hasta aburrirla...

Es fácil bugearte dentro del juego y rehacer todo de nuevo porque encima el auto grabado y el guardado manual son una mierda que te obliga a jugar desde el principio del capitulo... Ademas hay un bug donde puede desaparecer la partida... de pasarte tenes que cerrar y abrir el juego múltiples veces hasta que se arregle...

La historia es de lo mas mediocre y cliche, queriendo tener un giro al final pero solo logra llevarte al hartazgo y terminas pidiendo  por favor que el juego termine de una buena vez, el nivel final esta absolutamente alargado innecesariamente porque tampoco aprovecha para ponerte en situación... es y ""mira esta mecánica""... ""ahora repetila durante 2 horas""...

El juego tiene múltiples finales, entiendo que por lógica tiene por lo menos 4 finales... y que la idea de los desarolladores es que por lo menos lo juegues 2 veces.... pero la verdad que si quieren hacer eso el juego no tiene que ser cansino, la historia tiene que levantarte algún tipo de interés/curiosidad... no podes agarrar un conjunto de mapas lindos, ponerle una historia mediocre, repetir las mismas mecánicas una y otra vez, aunque en cierto punto son mecanicas innovadoras, repetirlas hasta el cansancio para después decirle al jugador ""AH Y ESTARÍA BUENO QUE VUELVAS A JUGAR EL JUEGO"" encima que en las 6 horas del juego no logras empatizar con el protagonista, que me da igual lo que le pase, con el niño perdido también me da igual, con el elenco de personajes secundarios y terciarios lo mismo, solo quiero que el perro tenga un final feliz, si lo logro ya me da igual el juego y paso de el.

El juego debería ser solo el nivel final, valer 0,5 dolares como mucho y hubiera sido la demo mas interesante que jugue... si igualmente queres jugarlo espera que lo regale Epic o compralo con un 95% de descuento...

Razem ze swoim psem będą zagłębiać się w te tajemnicze rejony, w których ewidentnie kryje się coś więcej..

Nie jest to tytuł dla każdego to pewne, mroczna otoczka tworzy dobry klimat delikatnego horroru, jednakże fabularny aspekt jest bardzo przewidywalny, a rozgrywka liniowa, odczuwalnie na siłę rozciągana co w pewnym momencie zaczyna solidnie nużyć.

[i]Mała dygresja:[/i]

1. Nie zwracajcie uwagi na mój czas gry na platformie Steam, gdyż jest nieadekwatny z realnym czasem który spędziłem z tym tytułem – który posiadam i ogrywałem na innej platformie/mach. Jak również posiadam edycję fizyczną pudełkową. 

2. Nie zamierzam zdradzać szczegółów fabuły, aby osoba zainteresowana tym tytułem nie straciła jednego z głównych elementów tej gry.

[h1]Ale do rzeczy:[/h1]
Jak już nadmieniłem na samym początku tej recenzji mamy tym razem do czynienia z tytułem z gatunku gier horroru psychologicznego w którym to gracz wciela się w byłego funkcjonariusza policji po przejściach, biorącego udział w poszukiwaniach małego chłopca który zaginął w uznawanym przez wszystkich nawiedzonym lesie Black Hills Forest. Razem ze swoim psem będą zagłębiać się w te tajemnicze rejony, w których ewidentnie kryje się coś więcej..

Fundamentem rozgrywki będzie piesza eksploracja owego mrocznego lasu w którym prowadzone są poszukiwania. Przy czym głównym terenowym nawigatorem, obrońcom oraz poszukiwaczem będzie nasz przy nożny zwierzak Bullet – tak naprawdę bez jego pomocy gracz mógłby zapomnieć o jakiejkolwiek interakcji z otoczeniem, nie wspominając o przesuwaniu fabuły do przodu. Gracza zadaniem będzie w głównej mierze podążanie za czworonożnym stworzeniem, badając poszczególne ślady, przedmioty na które natrafi na swojej drodze – w tym kasety wideo, których paranormalne możliwości mogą wiele namieszać w samej rozgrywce.  Jak również operować pomniejszymi przedmiotami jak latarka, telefon, kamera, krótkofalówka, których znaczenie dla prowadzenia rozgrywki będzie kluczowe.

Do dyspozycji mamy pewien zasób komend głosowych, pozwalających wywołać określone działania u Bulleta, od zwyczajnego szukaj, po zostań blisko, przywołania, zostań itp. Bez tego nasz cyfrowy zwierzak udałby się w świat zostawiając nas samym sobie (na pastwę losu) – co można dostrzec po jego niesfornym, lecz tez w pewnym sensie realistycznie odwzorowanym zachowaniu.  Las jest wykreowany bardzo starannie, wizualnie wygląda dobrze, chodzenie po nim jest ciekawym doświadczeniem – które albo polubicie, albo doprowadzi was do skrajnego znudzenia.

Nie oszukujmy się nie jest to produkcja która wywoła w was większych emocji. Jeżeli nigdy w życiu nie ograłeś/łaś żadnego growego horroru (to twoja pierwsza gra), nie widziałeś/łaś filmów na której bazuje owy tytuł  – to być może wywołać w was silniejsze doznania, aniżeli u gracza który ma za sobą większe rozeznanie/doświadczenie w tych gatunkach.

Jeżeli jednak mieliście kiedykolwiek styczność z poprzednimi grami tego twórcy jak Layers of Fear czy też Observer, nie licząc odmiennych od siebie koncepcyjnie produkcji, to kiedy się dokładnie przyjrzycie jej fundamentalnym szkielecie to dojdziecie do wniosku że bazuje na tej samej psycho-prowadzonej rozgrywce, której ostatecznie wspólny mianownik jest zawsze ten sam. Zwłaszcza aspekt fabularny, początkowo jest ciekawy jednak po odnalezieniu i przejrzeniu kilku kaset wideo już wiadomo kto jest głównym winowajcą tego wszystkiego – tu nie trzeba być książkowym Sherlockiem Holmes, choć twórcy robią wszystko aby namieszać wam w głowie. Przez co zakończenie, nie będzie aż tak satysfakcjonujące.

Czy to jest zła gra? na pewno nie, jak już wspominałem jest to specyficzny tytuł, który w zależności od waszych growych preferencji oraz współczynnika podatności na psycho-straszenie będzie wywoływać inne/odmienne emocje – „Mnie osobiście” gra znudziła jednak w waszym przypadku może wywołać zupełnie inne wrażenia.

Co do kwestii technicznych, oprawa audiowizualna jest dobra, sterowanie banalnie proste, choć można poczuć że gra była projektowana pod pady, przy czym dobitnie powolne i ociężałe. W grze nie brakuje też błędów, zwłaszcza porywcza natura Bulleta potrafi się co chwila zawiesić na elementach otoczenia. 

[h1]Podsumowanie:[/h1]

Blair Witch to specyficzny tytuł z gatunku horroru psychologicznego w którym to gracz wciela się w byłego funkcjonariusza policji po przejściach, biorącego udział w poszukiwaniach małego chłopca.

159524999,brazilian,2024.01.29 13:03,✅,❌,0.3724066615,2,"A análise do jogo ""Blair Witch"" envolve diversos aspectos, desde a narrativa até os elementos de jogabilidade e a atmosfera geral. Lançado em 2019, o jogo foi desenvolvido pela Bloober Team, conhecida por seus títulos de terror psicológico, como ""Layers of Fear"" e ""Observer"". Aqui estão alguns pontos a serem considerados na análise:

Narrativa:

O jogo se passa no universo da famosa franquia de filmes ""A Bruxa de Blair"". A história segue Ellis, um ex-policial que se junta a uma equipe de busca para encontrar um garoto desaparecido na floresta de Burkittsville.
A narrativa incorpora elementos psicológicos e sobrenaturais, explorando os medos e traumas do protagonista. O enredo se desenrola de maneira não linear, mantendo os jogadores intrigados e ansiosos para descobrir a verdade por trás dos eventos.
Atmosfera e Ambientação:

A floresta de Burkittsville é recriada com detalhes impressionantes, criando uma atmosfera densa e opressiva. O uso de luz e sombras contribui para a sensação de isolamento e tensão.
O jogo utiliza a escuridão e a limitação de visibilidade de forma eficaz, aumentando a ansiedade do jogador. A câmera encontrada pelo personagem principal, inspirada no filme original, adiciona uma camada adicional de imersão.
Elementos de Terror:

""Blair Witch"" explora o terror psicológico, brincando com a percepção do jogador e incorporando elementos sobrenaturais. A presença constante da Bruxa de Blair mantém uma sensação de ameaça persistente.
A utilização de fenômenos inexplicáveis, como mudanças súbitas no ambiente, cria um ambiente de suspense e surpresa. Os sustos são bem cronometrados, aumentando a intensidade do jogo.
Jogabilidade e Mecânicas:

O jogo combina exploração, resolução de quebra-cabeças e encontros com inimigos. A interação com a câmera é crucial para a progressão, adicionando um elemento estratégico e de imersão à jogabilidade.
O relacionamento entre Ellis e seu cachorro Bullet é um destaque, não apenas como companheiro, mas também como elemento de jogabilidade, ajudando na busca por pistas e enfrentando ameaças.
Aspectos Técnicos:

Gráficos sólidos e uma trilha sonora envolvente contribuem para a experiência. A ambientação sonora desempenha um papel significativo na construção da atmosfera de terror.
Algumas críticas podem ser direcionadas à performance em algumas plataformas, mas, em geral, o jogo entrega uma experiência satisfatória do ponto de vista técnico.
Em resumo, ""Blair Witch"" é uma experiência de terror envolvente que respeita e expande o universo estabelecido pelos filmes. Com uma narrativa intrigante, uma atmosfera densa e mecânicas de jogabilidade bem executadas, o jogo oferece uma imersão arrepiante para os fãs do gênero de horror.

Opening inventory and interacting with certain inventory items makes you stop moving. The dog's mechanics were a good idea but in practice another thing that makes you stop moving and just lock into 10 second long animations as you watch you character pet dog or feed dog. Not really any fluidity or flow to any of it. You're either walking doing nothing or you are locked into an animation, doesn't feel good at all. On top of that the story is extremely predictable: [spoiler] within an hour (I think as soon as I saw the second tape that informs you that Peter has been kidnapped.) It was obvious that the guy who kidnapped the kid was the player character. It was obvious watching a video of the sheriff being killed that you did it. Bad ending is perpetuating the cycle of your trauma/actions by being manipulated by the Blair Witch. This ending is of course the easiest to get, and designed to make you play a second time (of what I must point out is a fucking 6 hour long boring af walking sim). You use the flashlight to banish/kill monsters that are in the trees. Perhaps the implication is it is a gun and you are killing people hunting you or looking for Peter? Because killing any monsters gives the bad ending. Good ending requires basically walking through the game doing even fucking less (don't kill monsters, don't interact with wooden dolls, don't destroy totems.) [/spoiler] So it has an uninteresting story, the game is clunky to play, and it isn't even all that pretty. What's the point?","Uhhh it really just isn't particularly good in any way.

158203061,brazilian,2024.01.13 07:28,✅,✅,0.5,0,"Consigo ver várias pessoas gostando bastante desse jogo, mas não sou uma delas, não fez muito meu estilo.
Não sei se achei a ambientação meio rasa, ou se só não consegui me relacionar com o protagonista e seus problemas, e como esses são os pontos principais que carregam a história, prejudicou bastante a imagem para mim.
A relação com o cachorro é até legal, mas ela também não é desenvolvida de nenhuma forma, não parece ter tido o foco que deveria, visto que o cachorro está conosco na maioria do jogo.
O jogo também é demasiadamente escuro, visto que tenta trazer uma ambientação de terror, mas no fim das contas acho que serviu apenas para atrapalhar a jogatina. Além disso, o número excessivo de colecionáveis também prejudica bastante uma experiência de 100%, são cinco tipo de colecionáveis diferentes e honestamente, 42 fotos é simplesmente um exagero.

Mas como falei no início, consigo ver quem goste do jogo, pois é um jogo muito bem feito.
A trilha sonora é ótima e os gráficos também são bons, enquanto ainda fico com o pé para trás em questão com a história. Mesque que eu não goste muito do gênero de terror, ainda acho que fizeram um trabalho excelente transmitindo o suspense, além de não ter encontrado nenhum bug específico!

Багов не много но самый бесящий связан с собакой, для получения ачивки ""прощание навсегда"" один из пунктов погладить Булета 20 раз и если делать это не прирывно то просто в какой-то из разов анимация зависнит и с этим ничего не сделать кроме как перезапустить игру.

- Gameplay / zagadki: 6.0 – mechaniki z psem i kamerą fajne, ale momentami nużące i powtarzalne
- Grafika / oprawa artystyczna: 7.5 – dobrze oddany las, efekty świetlne działają – choć techniczne niedociągnięcia się trafiają

🔍 Krótki opis (bez spoilerów)

Kontrolujesz Ellisa, byłego policjanta z PTSD, który wraz z psem Bulletem przemierza las Black Hills, szukając zaginionego chłopca. W grze używasz latarki, kamery, psa i czasami telefonu. Kamera pozwala cofać czas, by zmieniać układ świata. Fabuła eksploruje psychikę bohatera, przy równoczesnym budowaniu klaustrofobicznego klimatu lasu

📝 Podsumowanie

Ocena ogólna: 7.0/10
""Blair Witch"" to klimatyczna gra z dobrym motywem psychologicznym i unikalnymi mechanikami. Jeśli lubisz lekki survival horror z narracją i pieskiem u boku – warto zagrać. Ale jeśli chcesz dynamicznej rozgrywki i intensywnych akcji, możesz poczuć niedosyt.

Let me tell you that after playing Blair Witch I do not carry a single doubt in Bloobers abilities to make a good Silent Hill 2 remake. The Game gets criticised a lot for the overarching storyline of the main protagonist, Ellis (which is a solid psychological horror in my opinion) and the way it handles the Blair Witch franchise. In my opinion it combines both of these things really well.
Gameplaywise there were some minor flaws and bugs regarding the AI of the dog, Bullet, but nothing major that took away the fun and suspense I felt when playing this.

警官である主人公は、森で行方不明の少年を探しながら不可解な現象に巻き込まれていく。

ホラー映画『Blair Witch』をベースにしたホラーゲーム。
日本語化されている。
映画をベースにしてはいるが映画を見ていなくても楽しめる。

森という広範囲が舞台のため探索範囲が広く、先に進む手がかりが少なく感じる。
雰囲気重視のサイコホラー系。
サイコホラーといっても追いかけっこがあるわけではない。
どちらかと言えば『Layers of Fear』に近い。

グラフィックもキレイで、演出もかなりこだわっている。
ストーリーは難解でわかりにくい印象。
陰鬱な雰囲気はいいが、
びっくりどっきりを期待している人は拍子抜けするだろう。
逆にジメッとしたホラーが好きな人、びっくり系が苦手な人にはいいだろう。

マルチエンドだが、一周が長いので全エンド回収は根気がいるだろう。

To me, the game is not scary, and butchers the whole concept of the film The Blair Witch Project. The biggest thing that made the film scary to me is the unexplainable and uncanny events that happen. For example, the 'cackling noises' at night in the film could really be anything. It can't be animals, and it can't be humans. What in the world could it be? Later on, ofcourse, you can hear children and other events happen, and it becomes truly disturbing. You realize that the legend of the Blair Witch is true. The witch herself, though, is never shown on camera.

Compare this to the story itself, the storytelling, and the atmosphere of the game, and you can clearly see the big differences. Whenever the main character experiences anything, whether he is finding a corpse, or finding anything that should be absolutely terrifying, the character is nothing more than surprised, and carries on as if nothing has happened. Also, this one 'white tree' that you encounter after a while, has black goo and tendrils on it. This has nothing to do with the story, and is purely used as a cheap way to add 'scariness' to the game (which does not mean that it IS scary!). To summarize, it is the smaller details that ruin the game. It is a good looking game, it's just the story and how it's being told that is totally crap.

I don't understand why these big media companies rated this game so high. Everything in the game just doesn't make sense. The main character has no good reason to go into the woods, his girlfriend doesn't add anything interesting to the story, he derails the search party and annoys them and me and I cringe hearing him tell the search party about certain gameplaying techniques.

First thing first, game is having a lot of issues and bugs. 
Following the install, it won't start without having to set up one environment variable to your Windows system by yourself.
Then it will still crash a couple of times. Till completely freezing the computer and requiring an hard reboot.

Then, a couple of times, I had to restart the game to be able to continue it. First time was really disappointing. I spent an hour to look at what to do or where to go. I finally left the game. Coming back to it, an element became actionable while it was not before the restart.
It happened again later. But this time, I got an hard doubt based on the previous experience and immediately rebooted the game. It was this. Problem solved. I could then normally continue.

The game itself is close to a walk sim. However, it is not always true and the sequences in the woods comes with a very good atmosphere.
The interactions with the dog are excellent.
The two combined made it a memorable moment that made me continuing to play.
Also, thanks to the narrative during that time, that is pretty good.
It is scary, stressful, without using too much jump scares. I counted one during that time. And this time is most of the game.

Many of the achievements makes no sense. I won't recommend to look for them. Finding all little things in a wood and most of the time with a torch light because it is by night does not make sense or is even not fun. You are supposed to be lost in this wood and to look for something important. Why chasing barely visible plastic wastes... Dull. Another artificial lengthening attempt but not yet the worst.

Then comes the real pain. A big hour repeating the same thing over and over. Being told the same story over and over. 
The final chapters. 
Every time I was crossing a door and after 10mn doing so, I was hopping for it to be the last time.
It is so uninteresting and so repetitive. So boring. I saw myself a couple of times abandoning there and watching the end on an online video... So painful.
The game is good at transforming the map when you just passed somewhere. You turn back, it is different. Or the path is blocked. And in the same time, it repeats itself by passing again where you have been. You may have seen the first movie. Lost kids turn around repeatedly in the forest. This impression is well rendered in the game and during the wood times.
However the last chapters over abuse it just for the sake of lasting the game longer. So lazy.
The game would have been much much better without that pain.

Conclusion is, the game should have been much shorter. This despite an excellent beginning and probably the first 75% of the game. It would also have permit to avoid repeating the trick with the torch light that fails to work. First time came without surprise. The next ones...

Когда же релизнулась одноимённая игра, я собственно от неё вообще ничего не ожидал. Я как то давно пробовал в неё играть, но быстро забил, и лишь сейчас дал ей второй шанс. И игру я таки прошёл, испытав умеренную дозу удовольствия. 

Геймплейно это чисто симулятор [strike]ходьбы[/strike] Курицына. Главный герой на пару со своим псом бродит по локациям, решает простенькие головоломки, пытается понять что вообще происходит, и попутно выполняет свою миссию по поиску пропавшего ребёнка. 

Атмосферно игра очень хороша. Она конечно и близко не сравнится с уровнем саспенса который нагонял ""Visage"", но в целом сойдёт. 

Визуально игра хоть звёзд с неба и не хватает, но выглядит вполне солидно для продукта категории B. 

Нарративно игра раскрывается только после первой половины, и то повествование тут крайне неторопливое и я бы сказал тягомотное. Играем мы за бывшего военного, который после службы в армии пошёл работать в полицию. От службы в полиции его отстранили из за одного инцидента, я не буду говорить что случилось дабы не спойлерить. Скажу лишь, что главный герой приехал на поиски пропавшего мальчика в том числе по личным мотивам. По мере прохождения выясняется, что ГГ страдает жесточайшим ПТСР, из за чего порой грань между реальностью и искалеченным сознанием просто стирается. И находясь в такой вот тонкой границе между травмами от ПТСР и паранормальными явлениями, главный герой пытается разобраться в происходящем, попутно выжить и не сойти с ума. 

Мой вердикт в целом - это 7/10 с учётом текущей цены и скидки в 80%. По скидке брать можно, за полный ценник точно нет.

Bonsoir à tous il est 02:04 et je viens de finir ce jeu. Alors que dire parce qu’il y a beaucoup de choses, positives mais surtout NÉGATIVES. D'avance je m'excuse je viens de finir le jeu, et cette évaluation risque de comporter quelques fautes, et désolé pour certains spoiler.

Donc Blair Witch, ayant adoré le premier film, et ayant vu les évaluations ainsi que le prix, je n'ai pu m’empêcher de m'empresser de l'acheter pendant les soldes d'hivers Steam (Thanks gros Gabe).

Je lance donc le jeu, et premier problème : IMPOSSIBLE DE CHANGER LES TOUCHES, je chipote mais honnêtement pour un jeu récent ne pas pouvoir le faire c'est un peu du foutage de gueule, sinon on s'habitue vite au touche clavier.

Après quelques minutes de jeu, honnêtement j'étais très optimiste, graphismes sympa, gameplay sympa grâce au téléphone et talkie mais sinon rien de transcendant. Sinon tout au long du jeu vous aurez votre compagnon le petit siensien qui vous aide à chercher (franchement cela n'ajoute rien au gameplay, peut-être un peu à l'histoire mais on pourrait s'en passer).

Comme dirait le JDG ""ils ont patouné"" Blaire Witch, c'est à dire qu'on passe beaucoup plus son temps à récupérer des collectibles sans réel intérêt que de profiter de l'histoire. Pour être franc arrivé un moment on arrête de chercher et on profite de l'histoire, du moins on essaye. Sur la fin et sur quelques moments, on a bien compris qu'il avait des soucis psychologiques, c'est d'ailleurs ça le problème ! La quasi totalité du jeu se base sur ça, tout comme beaucoup de jeu depuis les premiers Silent Hill (et surement avant). Aujourd'hui vous faites un jeu d'horreur, 90% du temps le protagoniste à un problème psychologique, et ça, c'est vraiment chiant.

L'histoire tiens, franchement pour être positif, il y a quelques surprises bien pensé. Le caméscope est sympa mais pas assez exploité. Le problème c'est que comparé à Outlast, CÉ NUL !!

Je n'ai pas fais beaucoup de jeu de la Bloober team, mais je comprend pourquoi maintenant. Quand vous jouez à un de leurs jeux, il n'y aucun enjeux justement. Les premiers mobs rencontré sont dignes d'un Alan Wake, et le reste ils sont juste la pour faire office de présence.

Pour résumer et je pourrais encore en dire pendant un moment : Blair Witch est un jeu très linéaire, avec quelques surprises mais il ne faut pas s'attendre à plus.",

[h3]Ich habe es mir - trotz vieler negativer Rezensionen - doch geholt und es nach 2 Std. wieder zurück gegeben.[/h3] 
Aber aus anderen Gründen, als von den meisten hier beschriebenen, denn es ist mir egal, wie nah ein Spiel am Film ist oder nicht. Ich betrachte das Game immer als eigenständiges Werk, und so hätten mir diese zwei Stunden auch durchaus Spaß machen können, wenn, ja wenn da nicht dieser fade Geschmack wäre, dass man mich verschaukelt hat..

Das Spiel sieht richtig gut aus, ein richtig schöner und geheimnisvoller Wald - so wie ich mir einen unheimlichen Wald vorstelle - perfekt in Szene gesetzt und lädt förmlich dazu ein, ihn zu erkunden.

Und da sind wir beim Problem. Ich kann den Wald nämlich nicht erkunden, denn er ist nur Kulisse.

Anfangs dachte ich noch - gut, ist vielleicht so gewollt, damit man erstmal den Parkplatz gründlich abcheckt, auf dem man startet - aber nein, das Game ist durchgehend so. Ich kann nicht vom Weg abweichen und werde nur durch Schlauchlevel geleitet. Nach 2m-3m links und rechts vom Weg, ist nämlich Schluss und langsam dämmert es, dass mir die ganze Kulisse nur vorgegaukelt wird.

Eine, wenigstens teilweise, erkundbare Welt erhofft man sich und wird schnell von der Realität eingeholt. Das Game ist entzaubert, denn die tollen Screenshots auf der Shop-Seite sind nichts weiter als Blendwerk. 

Hätte ich das vorab gewusst, wäre es zu keinem ""Kauf"" gekommen, aber die vielen Rezensenten, haben das für mich eigentlich Wichtige mit keinem Wort erwähnt. Vielmehr ließen sich Viele, die negativ rezensiert haben, ausschließlich nur darüber aus, dass das Spiel keinen echten Bezug zum Film hat und der Film viel besser war - also nur Game vs Film... 

Ganz ehrlich? Wen interessiert das?! Wenn ich spiele, interessiert mich das Spiel und zwar NUR das Spiel und nicht der Film! Wenn ihr den Film besser fandet, dann solltet ihr vielleicht doch lieber das passende Buch zum Film lesen, denn Bücher sind auch immer besser, als der entsprechende Film...

Rückerstattung war erfolgreich. Danke.

トロッコエリアと霧のエリアが、難しく彷徨っていたのでタイムロスをしました。
このゲームの１週目をクリアしての感想です。グッドエンドだったかわかりません。
何度も同じところに戻ってしまう、不気味な森の表現が最高に素晴らしかったです。
終盤の廃屋では、近代ゲームの演出テクニックのオンパレードだった感じがします。
全体的な評価は良かったのですけど、結構残念なところもあったような気がします。
雰囲気に拘っている為、逆にダメなところが目立つ作品になってしまった感じです。
人間がキャラクターの様に扱われている演出は、多すぎて無理があった気がします。
それは、イベントなどで後ろが壁になっていて、戻れない表現が多かったからです。
あと、ビデオを巻き戻しても、人間は生き返らない表現は個人的に気になっています。
ビデオの再生による仕掛けと、犬の死は因果関係がないところが逆に怖かったです。
個人的にはバレットを生き返らせる為、バレットを撮影したビデオを巻き戻す演出が
あれば更にいい作品になれたのではないかと思うけど、動物は元に戻らないみたいです。
この演出だと、他の作品との兼ね合いで避けた可能性もありますけど、残念な点です。
考察すると、エリスは人間や動物が生き返らないことを知っていたからやらなかった。
まるで、エリスは冷めた人間に見えてしまいます。ビデオも撮っていなかったのかな。
トロッコのエリアでの怪物との戦いは、バレットに任せきりで敵に何回も負けました。
エリスも武器を持って戦う、くらいの気持ちが必要だったのではないかと思いました。
そのせいでバレットが亡くなった時は、あまり感動ができなかった記憶があります。
エリスもこんな事があれば、誰も信用できなくなってもおかしくはないですけど、
バレットがいなくても、無事に生き残ることができたのなら少し引っ掛かります。
犬の死に拘ってるような印象が残り、結果的に後味の悪い作品となってしまった。
エリスは武器で戦わない設定なので、このゲームの終盤はまるで悪夢のようでした。
あと、終盤の廃屋は演出に拘り過ぎていた為か、ゲームとしては今一な感じがした。
演出が長すぎた気がします。しかし、余計なものが無い迷いの森の中は最高でした。
バレットと一緒にいると、まるで小説の中に入ったような雰囲気にさせてくれます。
小説だったら、最後までは読まなかったかも知れません。でもこれはゲームでした。
エリスの声が良心的なので、バレットと森の中を彷徨っているだけでも良かった。
私がプレイしたゲームの中では、かなり演出が凝っていて記憶に残る作品です。
買って良かったと思いますし、もちろんクリアできて良かったとも思いました。
しかし、何故このような評価になってしまったのかというと、エリスの過去です。
この作品の評価の別れ目は、エリスの過去に興味が有るか無いかだと思います。
エリスの過去を知ることにより、何かゲームの展開へ影響はするのでしょうか。
私はこの問題で、評価できる点として残るのが雰囲気などになってしまいます。
雰囲気が好きだったので、続編があればゲームプレイの候補には挙がるでしょう。
サイコロジカルホラーとして製作されましたけど、確かに続編は気になります。

151691301,english,2023.10.25 01:53,✅,✅,0.5476806164,4,"[h1]First-person footage: A one-way expedition to the Black Hills Forest[/h1]

It isn’t necessary for a horror game to give jump scares to shock its spectators. It’s enough to proposal a mysterious storyline buried in a profuse mist, while you go through a depressing forest that appears to have no end. The fear it provides is supernatural without being able to understand or spot who or what causes it. We’re stunned witnesses of the terrifying.

As I fathom it, the story of the game takes as its allusion Black Hills Forest in Burkittsville, Maryland. I could say that it’s a neoteric plot within the same history of the woodland. Former police officer and soldier named Ellis Lynch, with the companionship of his dog Bullet, join the search for the missing youth named Peter Shannon. Local stories tell about the cursed place. Those who stay at night never come out again. Ellis follows Peter's trail, while his surroundings transmute, revealing fragments of his past as night creatures crisscross his path. His ending, like a traumatic loop, is unforeseen.

The game is profoundly influenced by Myrick and Sánchez's first footage, [i]The Blair Witch Project[/i]; and also Adam Wingard's version. We’ll sight this mainly in its happening of the character's plot and in the setting/ambience. Although the game takes it to another direction, where upshot of the plot and the entire understanding of the story is carried out through breaking out of a loop. This is with the desire to achieve (cope with character trauma) a solid but at the same time tragic ending. The game shows a firm conclusion to blur its gruesome ambiguity and whodunit.

Just like in the footage I never saw the witch. Only I noticed the pitiless acts of her human marionette. Or I also glimpsed nocturnal creatures lurking and prowling in some parts of the forest. The witch, like an evil spirit, lives in the woodland, through which it feels like I’m being stalked all the time. Malevolence is omnipresent, her absence of which accomplishes psychological terror. Which achieves an atmosphere of uncertainty.

[h1]The beckon of the forest of the many eyes and whispers[/h1]

Like every horror story in the 90's, the plot develops without eradicating its ambiguity or loopholes. In the game, only the story is revealed as we intertwine the character's flashbacks as a horrid hallucinations (his traumas from the war and his relationship with his wife) with what we unearth (the character's memories and Peter's clues), that in the enchanted forest are appearing.

The whole story is veiled in the undergrowth of the forest. In our hiking to search for Peter, the place gradually discloses us its (hi)story. At first glance it looks like a walking simulator. But in reality the places contain symbolism of the character, pop-culture and the mythology of the witch. The forest is narrative, where the things secreted among the trees tell the context. Great interest has been presented in the script, because it reveals Ellis' mental problem, while the cutscenes express his past. The plot is woven between past and present, but always with the desire to indicate Ellis' possible end. All this is performed without loss of spontaneity and without shedding light on haziness.

The actors' voices are emotional, they manage to convey any feeling of anxiety, worry or concern. While the soundtrack is dark ambient, drone and some violin pieces to emphasize some parts, but always permitting the atmosphere (ambient, environmental and voice sounds) to intensify the trepidation. This makes the sounds encircle. It’s preferable to use headphones since the sound is binaural, namely, the sounds surround us. The game immerses the player, as it makes its way to the heart of the nightmare. The human voice and the witch's voice play an important role when Ellis suffers from delusions. So everything is well woven to give an envelopingly sinister story.

[h1]The forest of totems[/h1]

The way of playing is subordinated to the narrative and the setting. On the one hand, the forest is beautifully created. As the story progresses, an atmosphere with its colour palette presents itself to us differently. It always preponderates from clarity to opacity, from light to shadow and fog. If you see that everything is monotonous and repetitive, well, what did you anticipate? The forest is detailed; if you don't comprehend the woodland and its narrative, as well as being inside a Forest, then the developers haven't achieved their goal yet. Almost the entire time I stood envisaging the dusky and ominous beauty of the trees, bushes, rivers and the rarefied air.

Something that was accomplished well was the feeling of being in the forest without knowing where to go. There’re paths and routes as signs to mark our route. Some clues are revealed in conversations during the story. Our friend Bullet can also sniff to find the way. The game suggests attention to details. However, when I felt lost, I wanted to explore. Like the film, the game realizes the experience of walking in circles. I experienced that the forest has no end. It does this by looping, as in [i]Silent Hills P.T.[/i], you travel through the same place infinitely. To get out of there, following the trail of Peter's search, like a puzzle in moments, you break the loop to move forward. This loop structure is important to discover the true ending. The entire plot, each moment between the trees, are mini-loops that join the larger circle, the entire game.

In many places there’re collectibles that amalgamate the symbolic and psychological narrative of the story. The environment will play with our mind. Depending on certain actions —I’d say esoteric actions so that the player can figure out how to get out of there and break the circle— they lead to an end. It isn’t easy to realize, it’s not at first glance. On the other hand, the game combines a walking simulator with the interaction of the dog and with certain objects. Bullet can follow evidences and hints with his sense of smell, such as detecting enemies. You can interact with him (like giving him cookies or petting him) so that it’s not just a tool. Nevertheless, there’re dark places, so we rely on a flashlight and a video camera (escape or damage them). This one has night vision. Also in the game, since it has different rhythms, there’re tapes that can alter some element of the setting.

The character can run but without going fast. Also if he’s alone for a long time, he’ll feel faint. It corresponds to just how to lose sanity. Hinge on the scene, it’ll be one way to proceed (walk, sneak or run). He also carries a walkie-talkie and a cell phone with which he interacts with some characters. We have a backpack to know what we’ve collected. There doesn't seem to be much to do and that's the point in the game. Be determined by how you interact with the game, it’ll guide to an ending. Pay attention to every detail, to what the characters, documents or collectibles say, to know where to go. They’re like the compass in the game.

[h1]Trailing the breadcrumbs to the corner and don't look at her [/h1]

I realized the influence of the film. The game manages to immerse the player and give them the experience of psychological terror. I felt afraid at every moment, of being stalked, defenceless and vulnerable to an unknown and supernatural force. The places where they scared me were the fog and the house. It’s a remarkable adventure, where the proposal is how many times are necessary to get out of the forest. That's where its re-playability comes from. I highly recommend it, it’s a complete game without the need for a DLC. The design, art and footage are excellent.

[h1]Recommendation: 8/10[/h1]","[h1]First-person footage: A one-way expedition to the Black Hills Forest[/h1]

It isn’t necessary for a horror game to give jump scares to shock its spectators. It’s enough to proposal a mysterious storyline buried in a profuse mist, while you go through a depressing forest that appears to have no end. The fear it provides is supernatural without being able to understand or spot who or what causes it. We’re stunned witnesses of the terrifying.

As I fathom it, the story of the game takes as its allusion Black Hills Forest in Burkittsville, Maryland. I could say that it’s a neoteric plot within the same history of the woodland. Former police officer and soldier named Ellis Lynch, with the companionship of his dog Bullet, join the search for the missing youth named Peter Shannon. Local stories tell about the cursed place. Those who stay at night never come out again. Ellis follows Peter's trail, while his surroundings transmute, revealing fragments of his past as night creatures crisscross his path. His ending, like a traumatic loop, is unforeseen.

The game is profoundly influenced by Myrick and Sánchez's first footage, [i]The Blair Witch Project[/i]; and also Adam Wingard's version. We’ll sight this mainly in its happening of the character's plot and in the setting/ambience. Although the game takes it to another direction, where upshot of the plot and the entire understanding of the story is carried out through breaking out of a loop. This is with the desire to achieve (cope with character trauma) a solid but at the same time tragic ending. The game shows a firm conclusion to blur its gruesome ambiguity and whodunit.

Just like in the footage I never saw the witch. Only I noticed the pitiless acts of her human marionette. Or I also glimpsed nocturnal creatures lurking and prowling in some parts of the forest. The witch, like an evil spirit, lives in the woodland, through which it feels like I’m being stalked all the time. Malevolence is omnipresent, her absence of which accomplishes psychological terror. Which achieves an atmosphere of uncertainty.

[h1]The beckon of the forest of the many eyes and whispers[/h1]

Like every horror story in the 90's, the plot develops without eradicating its ambiguity or loopholes. In the game, only the story is revealed as we intertwine the character's flashbacks as a horrid hallucinations (his traumas from the war and his relationship with his wife) with what we unearth (the character's memories and Peter's clues), that in the enchanted forest are appearing.

The whole story is veiled in the undergrowth of the forest. In our hiking to search for Peter, the place gradually discloses us its (hi)story. At first glance it looks like a walking simulator. But in reality the places contain symbolism of the character, pop-culture and the mythology of the witch. The forest is narrative, where the things secreted among the trees tell the context. Great interest has been presented in the script, because it reveals Ellis' mental problem, while the cutscenes express his past. The plot is woven between past and present, but always with the desire to indicate Ellis' possible end. All this is performed without loss of spontaneity and without shedding light on haziness.

The actors' voices are emotional, they manage to convey any feeling of anxiety, worry or concern. While the soundtrack is dark ambient, drone and some violin pieces to emphasize some parts, but always permitting the atmosphere (ambient, environmental and voice sounds) to intensify the trepidation. This makes the sounds encircle. It’s preferable to use headphones since the sound is binaural, namely, the sounds surround us. The game immerses the player, as it makes its way to the heart of the nightmare. The human voice and the witch's voice play an important role when Ellis suffers from delusions. So everything is well woven to give an envelopingly sinister story.

[h1]The forest of totems[/h1]

The way of playing is subordinated to the narrative and the setting. On the one hand, the forest is beautifully created. As the story progresses, an atmosphere with its colour palette presents itself to us differently. It always preponderates from clarity to opacity, from light to shadow and fog. If you see that everything is monotonous and repetitive, well, what did you anticipate? The forest is detailed; if you don't comprehend the woodland and its narrative, as well as being inside a Forest, then the developers haven't achieved their goal yet. Almost the entire time I stood envisaging the dusky and ominous beauty of the trees, bushes, rivers and the rarefied air.

Something that was accomplished well was the feeling of being in the forest without knowing where to go. There’re paths and routes as signs to mark our route. Some clues are revealed in conversations during the story. Our friend Bullet can also sniff to find the way. The game suggests attention to details. However, when I felt lost, I wanted to explore. Like the film, the game realizes the experience of walking in circles. I experienced that the forest has no end. It does this by looping, as in [i]Silent Hills P.T.[/i], you travel through the same place infinitely. To get out of there, following the trail of Peter's search, like a puzzle in moments, you break the loop to move forward. This loop structure is important to discover the true ending. The entire plot, each moment between the trees, are mini-loops that join the larger circle, the entire game.

In many places there’re collectibles that amalgamate the symbolic and psychological narrative of the story. The environment will play with our mind. Depending on certain actions —I’d say esoteric actions so that the player can figure out how to get out of there and break the circle— they lead to an end. It isn’t easy to realize, it’s not at first glance. On the other hand, the game combines a walking simulator with the interaction of the dog and with certain objects. Bullet can follow evidences and hints with his sense of smell, such as detecting enemies. You can interact with him (like giving him cookies or petting him) so that it’s not just a tool. Nevertheless, there’re dark places, so we rely on a flashlight and a video camera (escape or damage them). This one has night vision. Also in the game, since it has different rhythms, there’re tapes that can alter some element of the setting.

The character can run but without going fast. Also if he’s alone for a long time, he’ll feel faint. It corresponds to just how to lose sanity. Hinge on the scene, it’ll be one way to proceed (walk, sneak or run). He also carries a walkie-talkie and a cell phone with which he interacts with some characters. We have a backpack to know what we’ve collected. There doesn't seem to be much to do and that's the point in the game. Be determined by how you interact with the game, it’ll guide to an ending. Pay attention to every detail, to what the characters, documents or collectibles say, to know where to go. They’re like the compass in the game.

Die gruselige Atmosphäre untermalt mit dem hervorragenden Sounddesign ist einfach großartig und nimmt im Laufe des Spiels immer mehr an Fahrt auf. Die Story ist von Anfang bis Ende sehr spannend und von der Grafik bin ich einfach bloß hin und weg. Der Wald ist so wunderschön gemacht! Das Erkunden hat so doppelt viel Spaß gemacht. Die Gameplay Mechanik dass man mit dem Hund agieren kann wurde sehr gut umgesetzt. Bullet ist auf jeden Fall eines der besten Hunde im Spiel! Er war so oft eine große Hilfe gewesen und er ist soooo niedlich!! <3 Man merkt wirklich die Verbindung und Liebe vom Protagonisten zu Bullet was wirklich sehr herzerwärmend war. Auch die Animationen von Bullet sind wirklich sehr schön und niedlich gemacht worden. 

Alles in allem kann ich dieses Spiel nur weiterempfehlen. Einfach super! 10/10",

Dica: o Celular de Ellis tem muitas informações e dicas uteis, consulte-o sempre que puder.
Agora.. Se você busca o 100%, vai ter que fazer a conquista de Pacifista, na qual você não pode usar a lanterna, apenas a câmera digital para se guiar.
Eu acho bom sua visão e seu senso de localização estar MUITO afiados, sem auxilio da lanterna o jogo fica extremamente escuro, a visão noturna da câmera não ajuda tanto quanto deveria e aliado ao fato que a floresta é muito densa e sem muitos pontos de referência, é muito fácil se perder, ou deixar passar algum coletável, o que vai frustrar muito jogador.

I'm writing this review because I wanted to tell you guys that I played this game 2 times with complete ending.
1st time I played this game on my friends PS4
2nd time I played this on my pc.
and believe me I never get disappoint with bloober team because I know they delivered the best haunted environment out in the market even if its layers of fear or blair witch.
This game pretty much scary if you dive deep into the forest and realise that you are not alone, because bloober team decided to give you a pet named ""Bullet"" its a dog which help you a lot in forest exploring and finding clues, and you can also pet your dog which I really liked it in game.
Thats my view on this game and I totally recommend to those who are looking for a simple horror not for jump scares, because I saw many negative review just because they are lost in woods and walking clueless. Its not about walking cluelessly as far as i think its about finding clues in open & clueless forest about a missing boy and a mysterious thing you just encounter in a haunted forest.

- Bugs
- The story is overwritten
- It doesn't stick the landing
- Voice acting is very inconsistent. Some sections are, some aren't
- The multiple endings are irrelevant as you won't find em without guides

[h1]Spoilers Rant[/h1]
[spoiler]The game started strong enough with our main guy going to the forest to join up with a search party with their dog. U can fully customize the dog, get a phone call on the way, and the parking lot has a bunch of cool tidbits to find left around. After which you officially begin and learn you rely on the doggo to find you clues in what honestly feels a very well designed forest. It feels similar but different in that real way where you are lost one second, and then see something you remember. The game however really instilled this fear of not letting the doggo go too far away, and the doggo has the bad habit of just darting of in full speed.

After chasing while sprinting I fell down a hill and learned that running is a bad call, and just had to wrangle the doggo constantly towards me as it does not just ""lead"", it will sprint to the target or waddle behind you. The tapes mechanic was cool, the phonecalls and radio were cool and heck even the recorder was very interesting. However the dog commands of praise/scold and treat felt very awkward and just led to animations you can't cancel. So if you accidentally press scold? Oops.

The game then started to show that it will put you in set locations that loop into itself until you find the thing it wants you to find, but also will introduce a enemy which is very neatly done imo as you don't see em until its too late and fighting them off is scary as well as you frantically search the treeline for anything out of place. However here I encountered my first big bug as Bullet did not want to show me the thing i needed, and instead just ran the same loop at full sprint over and over. This is also where the PTSD stuff starts to creep in...

The blair witch premise can be so simple. Normal goons getting absolutely lost in the woods by forces beyond their understanding. Maybe sprinkle some backstory in the horrors or past events. But the game instead starts layering in these 6 story-lines which are totally unnecessary, except maybe the sheriff one and missing kid. The Sheriff being worried about you but enabling you to cowboy it up can be ENOUGH character development. The kid being lost is also enough of a plot-device to go into the woods. But the Wife being abused at home and calling you every so often to reminisce is just messy. The war PTSD is wildly messy aswell and just leads to very jarring unrelated sections. The lost people pictures, totally unsolved or needed. Whats the deal with them? No answers. The lost kid being linked to a ptsd victim you murdered? The war leading up to you killing your squad by mistake and a random civilian woman??? Its so much random stuff that did not need to be here. Focus on the sherrif. Discovering people being gone. Maybe some loon that is behind it all? The sheriff. Have them try to escape but fail. Maybe force em to the house by bad weather...

My second bug was when the dog would get stuck at the sawmill and refuse to move. This section was fine and scary enough with having to explore through dark via car. The abandoned mill was outstanding aswell and really started to creep me out esp with the drawings. However the meeting with the loon completely threw me. The underground section was confusing. Him accepting and following along with the loon is completely insane. The mist section was amazing but it all leading up to your dog dying no matter what you do was just ... mean? They make it out as if you have a choice but you just dont.

The ending was amazing for 30% the beginning and exploring of the house was really fun but it then starts looping and goes to stress levels 110% and doesn't really come down for like 30-40minutes. All storylines are thrown in your face. There are some REALLY cool visual moments such as the room tilting or rotting away, the controls being taken over lightly at times to ""steer you"" in the wrong directions is really stressinducing in the best ways. But stuff just KEEPS. HAPPENING. AND. IT. DOESNT. STOP. It loops and loops and loops and loops, throwing cool visuals mixed with really boring exposition, mixed with this awkward silly stealth that requirsed you to stare at your own feet (looking up kills(?) you) so you don't see anything and the floor is honestly really not worth looking at. Only at 1 point was i tempted to do something (follow a blood trail) but as it was in the danger area, I just skipped. And then suddenly without a big fanfare, it ends.

So many weird storylines, interactables, collectables, locations and a doggo? You can already in your mind see how there must be a good ending if you collect everything and the doggo lives etc etc, or a super bad ending maybe, and then some endings where depending on which choices/interactables more info gets revealed. But AFAIK: The sherrif just dies no matter what. The kid's fate is out of your hands. Your dog's fate is somewhat in your hands maybe, but it has to die for the plot. The war, family, hospital plot is just flung at you no matter what, same with the loon. And the only ending that is different requires you to collect NO collectibles and not defend yourself from the monsters... Like how is this organically conveyed??? Its not like the first time you find a totem your char goes ""Prolly shouldn't mess with this"" and give you the option of putting it back down. Or carry the doggo past the scary effigies. Or even signal that the monsters dying is a bad thing. This is as if you discover a secret ending to Mario if you break no blocks, and collect 0 coins during the playthrough, and only kill bosses. HOW IS THIS ORGANICALLY CONVEYED.

The game is loops on loops on loops, the building, the forrest, the gameplay, even the game's story itself is a loop. (don't think about it because you kidnapped the kid but then also went to search for the kid but spend days weeks months in there but the kid was back after 3 days?) With a story way more complex than need be with too many threads. Gameplay that is just too long at the end that I cannot imagine myself replaying it. However. This game has some really cool moments, and I think the dog mechanic is a thing that could be improved and did add something interesting to a horror experience. Being alone is scary, being with something you care for and want to protect is even scarier. The phone and collectibles influencing your end could be a VERY cool, but instead its a binary ""normal gameplay""vs ""hyper specific quota"" ending. [/spoiler]

It feels like as if the writer wanted a different IP. The level designer had too many ideas and didnt wanna cut any. And the gameplay vision just wasn't there 100% I Like this game. I truly do. But this is a cake with chunks of raw dough, 10 different frostings and a theme that just makes you go ""but why?"".

The visuals and sound design are good and the story and characters are not bad either. Although, I do think that a little less music, a little less dialogue and a little less story might have made this game much better than it is. Somehow, even though our protagonist's backstory and its relation to the events in the game is not badly written, it definitely waters down the horror aspects of the game. Honestly, despite the great visual environment, it never matches up to the uncomfortable terror that the film excels at creating, primarily because the film makes you feel more immersed in your experience rather than explaining much about why all this is happening to the character that you are playing in the game. Horror games work better with less meaningfulness I think.  
Our dog companion, Bullet, is really cute. Though, while he is a great character and one of the best things about the game, his presence definitely makes the atmosphere of the game far more comfortable and safe than it should feel. His absence, in some ways, at least, might have made the game a little more terrifying. 
The main antagonist is okay. But he does talk too much and overshadows the main character of the franchise - the blair witch - in every way, unfortunately. Also, not a particularly scary or originally written character anyway.
It is a decent game and clearly a lot of effort has been put behind it but I would recommend buying it if on sale. Although, if you do like horror games with more emphasis on story, character and dialogue, this might be a good choice of game, irrespective of price. Definitely better than Alan Wake fare.","The game is not nearly as scary as I thought it will be and that, I am a little disappointed about.

Vorab das positive zu diesem lächerlichen Walking-Simulator:

-Grafik ist schön, dafür aber dank schlechter Optimisation auch Hardware-lastig. Hat mich jetzt nicht so gejuckt, weil mein PC ganz stabil ist, aber wer mit seiner aus dem letzten Loch pfeifenden GTX 1070 daher kommt soll halt keine 144 FPS erwarten.
-Atmosphäre im Wald selbst ist sehr gut, da können sich einige Spiele was abschauen
-mehr gutes gibt es nicht.

Die Story im groben:

Wir spielen einen Veteran mit PTSD und Geltungsdrang der auf dem schnellsten Weg zum Wald ist, weil sich ein kleiner Bub darin verlaufen hat und er der Polizei bei der Suche unterstützen will. 

Alle, sogar seine verflossene Alpha-Karen-Freundin mit der wir ständig ungewollten Kontakt aufnehmen müssen, zweifeln daran, dass er diese Suche nach dem Kind mental überhaupt verpackt, weil der dödl halt gleich noch ein dickes Kindheitstrauma mit sich schleift. Natürlich geht alles schief und er hat seine erste Panikattacke keine 3 Minuten zwischen den Bäumen. 

Ab dann dackelt man seinem Hund hinterher (dazu später mehr) und versucht das Kind zu finden, obwohl man sich schon lange selbst im Wald verlaufen hat. Aber das ist egal, weil der Protagonist so einen harten Geltungsdrang hat, dass er um das Kind zu finden lieber 10-mal selbst sein Leben lassen würde. Voll verständlich.

Highlights der Story sind schlechte Puzzles und wenig Horror gepaart mit absolut oberflächlichem und schlechtem Storywriting. Selbst das Ende mit Plot Twist ist weder Deep noch unvorhersehbar…

Meine Lieblingstellen waren entweder die Szene in der man über 5 Minuten durch immer wieder denselben Korridor läuft, weil die Autoren selbst nicht mehr wussten was sie als nächsten machen sollen ODER das Ende welches in einem 140m² Haus auf 2 Etagen spielt welches sich gut 60 Minuten zieht und immer wieder neue Formen annimmt. Keine Ahnung wie ich es geschafft habe zu dem Zeitpunkt das Spiel nicht zu deinstallieren…

Der Horroraspekt ist abartig lächerlich. Habe von dem Game echt was zum Fürchten erwartet, aber bis auf die grusel-Atmosphäre im Wald passiert da nix. Mit Jumpscares wird sich sehr zurückgehalten, was ich aber gut finde, da dass schäbiger Horror wäre. 

Es gibt ein paar Momente wo man sich gegen Monster verteidigen muss, welches einfach mit der Taschenlampe gedeixelt wird. Eins zu eins aus Alan Wake geklaut.

Jetzt kommt eines der größten Mankos im Spiel welches sehr subjektiv ist. Ihr müsst euch die ganze Zeit um ein scheiß Vieh kümmern. Durch die PTSD habt ihr einen Service-Doggo bekommen, welcher als Key-Element in der Story UND Gameplay dient. Ohne das Vieh geht nix, weil wir ihm quasi die ganze Zeit hinterherrennen müssen. Dieses abartige Scheiß-Vieh ist so gut umgesetzt worden, dass man fast Lust bekommt sich in Auto zu setzen und auf den nächsten Köter drauf zu halten den man auf der Straße sieht. Er kostet einfach Nerven und gibt einem die ganze Zeit das Gefühl mehr Klotz am Bein anstatt eine Hilfe zu sein. Man hat im Gameplay sehr kurzzeitig eine Pistole und kann ihn damit nicht verschießen, 0/10 Sterne. Außerdem macht es total Spaß sich um den kleinen Scheißer kümmern zu müssen, da welches von den 3 Enden man bekommt abhängig davon ist, wie man die Töle behandelt hat. Sehr innovativ! - in die falsche Richtung halt.

Die Steuerung ist Schmutz. Keine Ahnung ob es daran liegt, dass es für Konsolenkneckos besser ist oder die VR-Version dadurch besser funktioniert, aber mit M+KB ist es einfach nur eine undurchdachte drecks Steuerung.

Der Preis juckt mich jetzt nicht, aber für welche die mehr auf ihre Kohle schauen ist die Preis/Leistung einfach nur dreist. Wer sich trotz meiner Review die Mürre kaufen will, solls halt machen wenn’s im Sale is oder per Key was weiß ich…

Ach ja BTW es gibt keine wirkliche Hexe in dem scheiß Wald.

Ich kann das alles nicht mehr…

149686922,english,2023.10.07 07:59,✅,❌,0.5,0,"This game pushed me to see the original movie from 1999.   I dare say, I actually enjoyed the game a lot more, not that the movie wasn't good, far from it.    

I thought that Blooper overall did a very good job trying to stay within the bounds of the lore and staying ambiguous enough to let us form our own conclusions, whilst giving us more knowledge about the Blair Witch (more appropriately, her capabilities and the extent of potential victims).

For someone who mostly plays older games (early 2000's), I was blown away by the detail of the graphics, and I only had the settings on medium (GTX 1060 6gb).    I felt really immersed in the dark twisted forest of Black Hills.

I do somewhat agree with other reviews about the PTSD trope, however, the way that they tell the story behind this character's backstory was actually quite creative, but you will only find out if you find all of the psychiatrist notes.

(SPOILERS) Here's the layout of the story that I put together if you don't want to go through the trouble of finding them (I had to use a walk-through myself).

- During childhood, the main character Ellis, and his friend were playing in the Black Hills Forest when they come across a disheveled man/monster, and possibly a pet beast.

- His friend dies during the encounter, probably from the man.   What exactly transpired no one knows, the game never gives full details.   It is suggested though that there were supernatural elements at play from the discovered child-like drawings of trees with eyes all over, and trees shaped like creepy stick people (not the famous symbol)

- Whatever exactly happened, it caused Ellis to develop amnesia/memory loss of that event as a coping mechanism, but also caused him to require therapy for years, where these psychiatrist notes come from.

- His father, a colonel in the army, seems to have pushed Ellis to join the army as an alternative to therapy after lack of real progress (father is described as tough and emotionally distant), even though the psychiatrist thinks that what Ellis may experience in the line of duty may replace one trauma with another (to which he is correct).

To summarize what the main part of the game did portray story-wise, Ellis did something that caused the death of six comrades, (probably had an episode or something off-screen, this was the only ambiguous plot-line that I felt could have been more direct and consice).   During that event he killed an innocent bystander to stay alive.    He came back from duty to become a police officer, but shot and killed an un-armed robber at a grocery store (had another episode).    His PTSD was causing life to get worse and worse, and to help with his mental state the sheriff gave Ellis a retired police dog as emotional support.    

Ellis ultimately went back into the woods with his dog as a hermit, and from there the Blair Witch completed his transformation into her new pawn, which we find out she is able to transport him through multiple time-eras spanning a few years, to which it can be deduced that Ellis, now Carver, was the one who killed his childhood friend causing a time-loop to repeat itself until you get the good ending.


I highly recommend doing one play-through where you get all of the notes, papers, and items and go through them carefully to piece together the story.   I had a blast doing that on my end!

Altogether, I would rate this game an 8.5 out of 10.","This game pushed me to see the original movie from 1999.   I dare say, I actually enjoyed the game a lot more, not that the movie wasn't good, far from it.

Bloober Team известна, в первую очередь, как создатели недорогих, но годных хорроров, которые впечатляют художественной частью и работой со звуком. Если играли в Layers of Fear или Observer - то, наверное, понимаете, что я имею ввиду. Атмосферу этих игр можно мазать толстым слоем на батон, а фокусы с окружением, которое меняется каждые пару секунд у тебя за спиной, впечатляет до сих пор. Blair Witch от этих канонов практически не отходит.

В центре действия - мужчина по имени Эллис и его верный пёс Буллет, с которым он приезжает в лес на поиски пропавшего ребёнка. Что это за лес - объяснять, думаю, не нужно. Вы ведь смотрели фильм, да? Так или иначе, с первых минут нам дают понять, что у Эллиса проблемы с крышей (и речь тут не про мафию). Поэтому поиски мальчика довольно быстро отходят на второй план, а им на смену приходят различные странности в виде галлюцинаций, вьетнамских флешбеков и прочих бед с башкой. И чем ближе мы к финалу, чем глубже погружаемся в лес - тем сильнее лес давит на нас, а грань между реальным и нереальным постепенно становится неразличимой. Реализация леса в игре - моё почтение. Он очень огромный и густой, деревья в нём - высокие и зловещие, а недурное освещение придает ещё большего погружения в атмосферу, заставляя чувствовать себя маленьким, одиноким и потерянным среди всей этой растительности. 

По геймплею это всё ещё симулятор ходьбы, разбавленный несложными загадками, чтением записок, сбором всяческого хлама и взаимодействия с псом. Буллет - не просто четвероногая декорация, а наш непосредственный друг и напарник. Он может найти и притащить в зубах спрятанные вещи, привести в нужное место, обнаружить врагов и не даёт Эллису (то есть нам) потерять рассудок, находясь с ним рядом. У нас, в свою очередь, есть функциональное меню, которое позволяет отдавать приказы Буллету: что-то найти, идти рядом, поругать или похвалить. А ещё пёселя можно покормить косточкой. За хорошую работу или просто так. Ну не круто ли? :) Отдельно отмечу занятную механику с видеокассетами. В какой-то момент мы находим видеокамеру и кассеты с красной полоской. Они позволяют нам менять окружение в том месте, что мы видим на записи. Самый просто пример: видим закрытую дверь, находим кассету, просматриваем её до момента, где дверь будет открытой, ставим видео на паузу, убираем камеру и видим, что дверь в реальном мире теперь тоже открыта. На этой фишке завязана пара-тройка интересных и несложных головоломок, которые немного разбавляют ходьбу и чтение записок.

Страшная ли игра? На самом деле - не особо. Тут есть пара жестоких моментов и несколько скримеров ближе к финалу, но напугать они способны разве что домохозяйку, которая до этого играла в The Sims или Весёлую ферму. Но игра, при этом, дико атмосферная и местами неуютная. Напряжённая, давящая. Нередко - за счёт красивой картинки и хорошего звука. Когда попадаешь в замкнутые пространства или тёмные коридоры, пытаясь выхватить фонариком хоть что-то, похожее на проход или дверь, тебе на ухо шепчут голоса, а за спиной что-то шуршит - страха, как такового, ты может и не испытываешь, но выбраться из этого места всё равно хочется поскорее.

Ко всему прочему, игра не особо продолжительная, что играет ей только на руку. Разработчики не стали душить нас прятками от монстров (им теперь можно дать отпор фонариком, как в каком-нибудь Alan Wake), затянутыми загадками или долгими экспозициями к предстоящим действиям. Вместо этого, локации сменяются друг за другом, редкие стычки с противниками едва занимают одну-две минуты, а пустая ходьба сведена к минимуму: мы либо находим записки, проливающие свет на происходящее, либо находим коллекционные предметы, либо наслаждаемся сюжетными сегментами и катсценами. Сюжет тут хоть и довольно простой, но за счет небольшой продолжительности и плотной событийности способен удержать внимание на весь вечер, пока не пойдут финальные титры.",

[b]„Blair Witch“ ist beileibe keine Vollkatastrophe, es ist jedoch auch kein gutes Blair Witch Spiel, denn dafür fehlen meiner Meinung nach die Alleinstellungsmerkmale, um den Titel von Layers of Fear (LoF) abzuheben. Auch haben mir persönlich die ganzen kleinen & großen Ungereimtheiten insgesamt den Spielspaß verdorben, allen voran die unnachvollziehbare Strenge des Spiels, wenn es darum geht, etwas anderes als das schlechte Ende zu erreichen und das unsagbar repetitive & in die Länge gezogene Spukhaus-Finale, welches im krass negativen Kontrast zum Rest des Spiels steht.[/b]

Dabei fängt Blair Witch eigentlich ganz vielversprechend an, denn die ersten Spielstunden bluten förmlich Atmosphäre. Trotz der fehlenden Einstellungsmöglichkeiten für chromatische Aberration & Schärfentiefe wirkt die grafische Präsentation sehr überzeugend und man hat stellenweise wirklich das Gefühl, in einem lebendigen & atmenden Wald unterwegs zu sein. Die einzelnen Abschnitte wirken überaus detailliert und bis ins Late Game hinein besucht man die unterschiedlichsten Locations, die alle so gut In Szene gesetzt werden, dass das Worldbuilding & das Environmental Storytelling zum Selbstläufer werden. Auch die Soundkulisse wirken einfach großartig. Anfängliches Vogelzwitschern und Windhauchen durch die Bäume weicht alsbald einer erdrückenden nächtlichen Stille, das Ganze untermalt mit dem wunderbar stimmigen & gruseligen Soundtrack. Wenn man sich erst einmal im stockfinsteren Unterholz verlaufen hat und es überall um einen herum knackt, knirscht & heult, beginnt man, ähnlich wie im echten Leben auch, unweigerlich Dinge zu sehen, die gar nicht da sind, was in einer wirklich hervorragenden Horrorspiel-Erfahrung resultiert, die man nicht so schnell vergisst. In diesen Momenten ist Blair Witch bemerkenswert nah dran an der Atmosphäre des ersten Films.

Schon bald rücken dann die psychischen Probleme des Protagonisten Ellis in den Fokus und zwar irgendwann so sehr, dass sich die ganze Blair Witch Prämisse oft untergeordnet anfühlt. Es wird nun nach und nach immer mehr… „typisches Bloober Team Gameplay & Storytelling“ eingebaut und ehe man sich versieht, ist man von den aus LoF bekannten, sich verändernden Räumen umgeben oder man wird durch eine ganze Reihe sehr linearer Sektionen geführt. Ich kann gar nicht genug betonen, wie sehr mich Blair Witch in diesen Momenten an LoF erinnert, was einerseits sicherlich in Ordnung geht, andererseits aber auch irgendwie schade & unverständlich ist, denn anstatt zu versuchen, die anfängliche, ganz hervorragende Atmosphäre beizubehalten und das Gameplay darauf aufzubauen, rückt die eigene Identität von Blair Witch ein ganzes Stück in den Hintergrund, um Platz für Altbekanntes zu machen. 

Nun gut, damit kann man sich irgendwie arrangieren. Das aus meiner Sicht wirklich fragwürdige daran ist jedoch, dass ich, ähnlich wie in LoF, auch hier schnell merke, dass mir in kaum einer Situation Gefahr droht: Es kommt entweder an bestimmten Stellen des Spiels zu gezielt herbeigeführten Konfrontationen mit den Monstern oder ich kann halt völlig blauäugig durch den Wald bzw. durch Ellis Erinnerungsfetzen stolpern, ohne das mir etwas passiert. Es gibt so gut wie kein dazwischen, keine random auftauchenden Feinde, die dann Patrouille laufen oder ähnliches. Wenn man schon die Entscheidung trifft, gefährliche Monster in sein Spiel einzubauen, warum dann die Konfrontationen so erzwungen wirken lassen, liebe Entwickler? Und warum diese Konfrontationen dann so anspruchslos gestalten? Um das Spiel nicht ZU anspruchsvoll & gruselig zu machen, damit man eine möglichst große Spielerschaft anlockt? Wirklich schade ist das. 

Apropos anspruchslos: Das Gameplay an sich ist sehr seicht und auch die meisten Aufgaben & Puzzles, die man lösen muss, sind so dermaßen einfach, dass sie kaum der Rede wert sind. Das ist völlig okay und ich habe auch nichts anderes von Bloober Team erwartet, nur liegt hier gleich der nächste Crux begraben, denn um die verschiedenen Enden freizuspielen, muss ich bestimmte Dinge tun und andere sein lassen. Auch das geht völlig in Ordnung und fördert den Wiederspielwert, nur fühlt es sich einfach nicht gut an, wenn man mit dem Spieler so gar nicht kommuniziert, was er tun darf und was nicht und ihn lieber direkt in schlechte Ending schlittern lässt, weil er es z.B. gewagt hat, [spoiler]die Monster im Wald oder die Personen im baufälligen Haus auch nur kurz mit der Taschenlampe anzuleuchten[/spoiler]. Später weiß man, dass das ganze Spiel voll mit solch esoterisch & kontraintuitiv designten Entscheidungen ist und ich frage mich tatsächlich, was sich dabei gedacht wurde. Und sollte ich trotz allem doch noch auf die glorreiche Idee kommen, ein derart lineares Walking Simulator Horrorspiel wie Blair Witch mehrmals hintereinander durchspielen zu wollen, immer hoffnungsvoll, dass ich diesmal alles richtig machen werde, dann erinnere ich mich halt kurzerhand an das sich ewig hinziehende Finale zurück, welches meiner Meinung nach so dermaßen in die Länge gezogen wird, mit sich ständig wiederholenden Räumen und übermäßig vielen forciert wirkenden Psychotrips & Jumpscares, dass mir direkt wieder die Lust vergeht. 

Zumindest zu Hund Bullet kann ich noch ein paar positive Dinge sagen, denn dieser wirkt sehr sympathisch und das Agieren mit ihm macht meistens Spaß. Bullet verhält sich recht glaubwürdig, er tollt & schnüffelt eifrig herum, er bringt einem Sachen und man kann ihn streicheln, ausschimpfen oder ihm Leckerlies geben. Das alles wirkt wunderbar knuffig und die Art und Weise, wie der Hund ins Spiel eingebunden wird, passt ganz gut zum sehr seichten Gameplay. Auch kann ich es durchaus verschmerzen, dass ich das Befehlssystem für den Hund die meiste Zeit über kaum benötige, da Bullet sich meistens eh in der Nähe aufhält und ich nur an vorgegebenen Stellen (siehe: gezielt herbeigeführte Konfrontationen) wirklich seine Hilfe benötige. Auch fungiert Bullet als emotionales Kernelement von Blair Witch und im Laufe des Spiels kommt es zu ein paar so herzzerreißenden Situationen, dass man den Hund am liebsten direkt in den Arm nehmen möchte. 

Im Endeffekt ist es so, dass, wenn Dir Layers of Fear gefallen hat, dann wird Dir mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit auch Blair Witch gefallen. Ich für meinen Teil bin jedoch erneut von Bloober Team enttäuscht worden.

From the get go, it seems like Bloober took the 2016 movie as a blueprint in terms of atmosphere and tone and while I don't know if that was more of a decision resulting from publisher/rightsholder pressure but, I can definitely say that it wasn't exactly the best choice. Then there is the issue of the game running poorly in certain areas and even though it looks good overall, I don't see much else that can merit this kind of problem other than poor optimization. Coupled with one nasty, progression halting bug that required a complete restart of a certain part, I can't say stability is the game's best quality.

In terms of gameplay and structure, however -since I got to experience some of Bloober's previous games- I didn't expect nothing other than a glorified walking simulator that has a decent atmosphere with an interesting story on top and with both the good and the bad, this one can be summarized as that as well. The good consists of how they tried to spice things up with the ""camcorder"" and companion mechanics respectively, alongside the limited ways you can use your key items; while the bad consists how annoyingly inconsistent the AI is to flesh out said companion mechanic, controls and UI design feeling clunky to navigate respectively and lastly, enemy designs being uninspired, boring and to a degree annoying. 

The final act kinda redeems some of the game's flaws, ties the slightly interesting narrative up decently and uses perhaps the 2016 film's only interesting element mostly to its advantage, but even that whole segment goes on for far too long and ends up way too repetetive. Ironically enough, if you'll look at my playtime you'll see that it isn't that long -I'll even go ahead and say that the game is way too short actually- but still that last stretch felt all the more drawn out despite not even amounting more than a small portion of the experience as a whole. That in itself is an achievement, but just not specifically a positive one...

149458425,english,2023.10.03 21:33,✅,✅,0.5,0,"Where to start? As a longtime fan of the original movie, I've always wanted to try this game. But at the same time, I was always skeptical and didn't want to waste money on a game that I would be disappointed with. That's why I waited until the game was at a good discount. I bought it for €5.99, which was an acceptable amount for me. After finishing the game, I can say that the developers would definitely deserve more for it, but not the full amount, which is excessive in my opinion. But this applies to most games I've ever played.

Back to the review. Despite the fact that the game is very short, I had to play it intermittently because of the frustration it caused me. I don't mean that the fault is entirely on the game side, maybe I didn't focus perfectly on it (I suspect I have ADHD myself), maybe my IQ is lower than I think, who knows?

One thing is certain. After a pretty good initial part of the game, I ended up looping around the campsite only because there was a strangely identical stone as in the video. After about 20 minutes of thinking, I gave up and went to sleep. The next day, I turned the game on again and the situation from the previous evening was repeated again.

That was the first time I asked uncle Google for help. After this failure, I said to myself ""ok, I should have thought more"", hopefully it will be better in the future.

Unfortunately, it happened again even though I already relatively understood what to do, and that the found video tapes affect the environment in the game.

This would not bother me so much tho, as I say part of the responsibility is definitely on my side.

What really pissed me off and at the same time it was the second time I had to turn the game off and go to sleep was the end of the game. It was absolutely unnecessarily long and annoying, and from those situations when I was about to get scared, I was only more annoyed. I wasn't scared, I was bored to death and I just wanted to finally finish the game.

I was literally screaming at the TV, ""please go ♥♥♥♥ yourself and let me finish it"", ""I just want to ♥♥♥♥ing see the end"", ""aaaaaaaaargh""...

I understood a long time ago that the main character suffers from PTSD, that he blames himself for the deaths of his fellow soldiers and his ruined relationship with his wife. It really wasn't necessary to forcefully stretch it and add completely unnecessary playtime.

I praise the developers for the elements of a totally twisted mind♥♥♥♥ in the form of psychic blackmail from Carver.

So here goes the conclusion. 

Is this game a masterpiece? It's not.

Is this game true to the idea of Blair Witch? From my point of view, yes, it is confusing and frustrating enough, both the forest and the witch are represented very similar to the original film, so I can say that the developers have done a really good job in this regard.

Is this game worth the full €29.99? I don't think so and I'm glad I didn't buy it for that amount, but I still insist that the developers deserve more than the €5.99 I paid for the game.

Will I play this game again to see the supposed different endings? Highly unlikely, but who knows, maybe I'll change my mind, I really want to give this game a fair chance and on the second playthrough I'll know in advance what to expect and maybe I'll focus more on the outcome.

PS: I saw a review that says this game deserves its place next to Amnesia or Silent Hill. I agree with the first, not by chance with the second. Silent Hill (any of the first 4 parts) is a completely different level. It can definitely be compared more with Amnesia (which is a fairly good game, that revolutionized the genre). At the same time, I don't agree that this game is on the same level as Outlast. Blair Witch is definitely better than Outlast which was a terribly boring horror game.

For developers:
In the future, I recommend getting more inspiration from games like Resident Evil and Silent Hill. Their replayability is unmatched. At the same time, I would welcome mechanics that would break the monotony of this game, such as the need to sleep or eat, more inexplicable changes in the environment instead of cycling in one location, more clues and more thoughtful puzzles. The game is a good addition to the Blair Witch franchise and you should be proud of it no matter what I just wrote. Just consider, in the future, that is, if you were to make another game based on the movie, before the release, invite beta testers who have seen the movie and have experience with top games in the horror genre. This game could have been a masterpiece given the quality control was better.","Where to start? As a longtime fan of the original movie, I've always wanted to try this game.

Outside of the often repeated complaint that the game basically railroads you into the worst ending from the very start (which really does suck), it's an extremely disappointing experience.

The game actually starts out super strong. The Blair Witch IP is cool enough and a hike through the woods with these cool dog command mechanics could make for a very nice experience. The background for the main character Ellis is also very well written. The story plods along and is interesting enough to want to see it to the end. We go deeper into the woods and feel something messing with our heads while we investigate and try to find our way forward. All good. 

However, after about chapter 12 the game takes an absolute nosedive. It quickly divulges in a very linear sequence of pure scripted events. These often take so long that you'd be hankering to do anything than walk forward. And when the game does prompt you to do something, the action takes actually leads you more and more into the bad ending. The worst offender is the canyon sequence in Chapter 14 where you will be slogging through for what feels like an etenity. You'll ask yourself the question if you really need to just walk for 10 minutes without stopping or do you want to [spoiler]take the easy, less annoying option to move on with the game > Press the C-button and possibly kill your dog in the process[/spoiler]. I bet many, many people would do that last bit because they thought the sequence would otherwise never end. I hate the term walking simulator because I think it's insulting, but god there is no other term to describe that slop.

The absolutely worst thing is that the final chapter turns a very cool concept for a horror game into the same damn ""Boo! Haunted House!"" simulator of linear sequences that are just the very bottom of the barrel when it comes to horror games. I wanted Blair Witch, NOT Layers of Fear, Bloober Games. Yet it appears you just couldn't help yourself.

[spoiler]It really couldn't hurt to make this a game ""just"" about someone with PTSD who goes into a witch-haunted woods looking for a missing kid. Good ending = you found the kid in time. Bad ending = fill in the blanks. That would make for a good experience. 

But no. They just *had* to make it 2Deep4U with the psychological horror game 101 pack including scattered psychiatrist notes, voices constantly telling the protagonist he sucks and a totally honed in SECOND ""I did something bad that makes me feel guilty"" thing right at the end. It's such bad, cliché writing. Such a cop out and such a garbage ending any way you slice it, it's inexcusable. 

Sometimes less is more. So sometimes, a guy getting lost in the woods while looking for a missing kid is all it takes. Maybe there is a witch, maybe it's his PTSD. But just stop there. Stop. [/spoiler]

属于IP类定制游戏里较为优秀的产品，整体氛围不错，剧情尚可，游玩体验一般，狗狗的设计本应有更大的发挥空间：作为隐形的引导方式很好，也有部分交互，但中后段就纯粹沦为剧情工具比较遗憾。游戏对SD的支持不太好，拿出摄影机看录像带就卡死，比较遗憾。整体优化也不算太好，我的老机器带得稍显吃力。
说说优点：制作组一贯的氛围营造到位，白天的森林和夜晚的森林氛围都挺出色（如果是用dont scream的虚幻5引擎表现应该更到位，那我的机器就更加带不动了····），几个探索的场景刻画都还可以，音乐音效也点缀得恰到好处。特别是只能在DV里看到的红色怪物剪影和对着空气狂吠的狗狗这类恐怖氛围烘托很克制，毕竟看不见的比看得见的更恐怖。制作组对鬼打墙式的套路已经玩得很得心应手了，初期的几个时空转场做得都还不错。
再说说不足：鬼打墙式的玩法注定一遍流，通关后基本没有欲望再来一次，这也是这类游戏的通病。制作组对场景和人物的精神状态融合还不够，人物的精神状态被女巫拿捏后，应该针对人物的状态做一点空间上的变化或者色调的递进变化，而不是单纯用剧情过场来进行解释。（举一个寂静岭2的例子，男主中期深入寂静岭探索来到监狱，监狱需要不断一层一层往下跳，越深处，里面的怪物越丑陋，氛围也越压抑，这是男主不愿面对自己内心真实想法的表现，制作组用外在的空间变化勾连主角的内心世界，玩家在不知不觉中也被深深代入。同时，寂静岭特有的表里世界也不断在呼应主角的表里不一。）游戏里最后一幕林间小屋的空间表现令人失望，虽然制作组致敬了大量的原著经典段子：墙上密密麻麻的手印、站在墙角逃避女巫的蛊惑。但在空间变化和氛围营造上没有令人惊喜的地方。（吐槽一下抱着狗狗走路那段，实在太长太无趣了，情感上完全无法同步···）",

Felt really weird about this game. People say it's atmospheric, but I don't really see why. You walk in circles in the woods and there are some random creature consisting of branches attacking you while you try flashlight them away? I honestly couldn't even understand what was attacking me most of the time.  Yeah, the forest looks nice, but it doesn't make the game atmospheric when it throws some enemies at you without even explaining what's going and why, all of a sudden, you're being attacked by some magical forest trees. 

The dog's animations are not that great for a game focusing on it. It makes all these weird movements, rushing forward and then circling around to get back all the time. Whimpering at some random tree that has nothing on it and then laying down on the ground as if it's quite comfortable in here and it wasn't being nervous 10 seconds ago. 

They throw a lot of stuff at you during the first hours - PTSD, missing children, some kind of magic VHS rewinding, marriage issues, strained relations with a local sherrif... But I can't really feel anything about it. Maybe it's the flat voice acting, maybe it's the writing, maybe it's just the nonsensical premise of you going alone in the woods in the dark with only a flashlight and a phone. I mean, we are in the forest, and we don't even have a compass? 

But you probably should expect a mediocre game given the original movie wasn't that much fun either.

En este viaje por Black Hills encarnamos el papel de Ellis, un expolicía y veterano de guerra que se adentra en el bosque para unirse en la búsqueda de un niño desaparecido.

La trama se cuece a fuego lento y deja que el jugador vaya elaborando sus propias conclusiones.

Gráficamente luce bien, aunque algunas texturas y escenarios no están a la altura del conjunto.

El audio es excelente, da verdadero gusto escuchar los diálogos y efectos de sonido.

La optimización es pésima; a duras penas se mantienen los 60 fps.

[b]Voto complessivo:[/b] 7,5/10

[b]Grafica:[/b] 6,5/10 (Con colpi d'occhio suggestivi)

[b]Ambientazioni:[/b] 8,5/10

[b]Gameplay:[/b] 7/10

[b]Blair Witch[/b] è un'avventura psicologica che ci porta nel cuore della famigerata foresta nera di Burkittsville, un luogo noto per le storie inquietanti e i misteri legati a una serie di eventi sconvolgenti. Questo gioco ha molto da offrire, ma anche alcune aree che lasciano a desiderare.

Partiamo dalla grafica, che riceve un solido 6,5/10. Sebbene ci siano momenti in cui l'atmosfera oscura e disturbante della foresta si traduce in scenari suggestivi, la grafica può risultare altalenante. Tuttavia, con colpi d'occhio suggestivi, il gioco riesce a catturare l'attenzione e creare momenti di vera bellezza visiva. Questo dimostra che, nonostante le sue limitazioni, Blair Witch può offrire alcune immagini memorabili.

Parlando di ambientazioni, Blair Witch ottiene un solido 8,5/10. La rappresentazione della foresta nera e dei suoi misteri è superba. L'uso intelligente della luce, degli effetti sonori e delle variazioni atmosferiche cattura perfettamente l'essenza dell'horror psicologico. L'immersione in questo mondo oscuro è sicuramente uno dei punti di forza del gioco.

Il gameplay riceve un punteggio di 7/10. Sebbene ci siano momenti di tensione e momenti di vera e propria paura, l'esperienza di gioco può risultare a tratti ripetitiva. L'utilizzo del cane come compagno è un elemento intrigante ma potrebbe essere stato sfruttato in maniera più approfondita per aggiungere ulteriore varietà al gameplay.

[b]Un consiglio prezioso è giocare a Blair Witch con le cuffie, in modo da immergersi completamente nell'atmosfera cupa e vivere l'esperienza nel modo più coinvolgente possibile.[/b]

In sintesi, Blair Witch è un gioco che cattura l'essenza dell'horror psicologico e offre un'immersione convincente nella foresta nera. Se riesci a superare alcune carenze grafiche, troverai un'esperienza che vale sicuramente la pena di essere affrontata per gli amanti del genere.",

Estamos en días de Halloween, y para celebrarlo decidí jugar un par de títulos, incluido Blair Witch, un juego del cual no esperaba tanto pero me ofreció un buen contenido y ¡una buena dosis de horror! Voy a enumerar algunos apartados que considero los más importantes de dicha entrega.

[b]Historia:[/b] Esta es una de esas tramas en donde cualquier mínimo detalle que cuentes ya es spoiler, así que voy a tratar de explicar lo menos posible para no entorpecer la historia. Me pareció excelente el lore de este juego, te tiene enganchado todo el tiempo debido a los acontecimientos que van pasando, porque en muchas situaciones no sabés qué es lo que sucede, por qué estamos ahí (dejando de lado el ""objetivo principal"") y, poco a poco, nos vamos a ir enterando de lo que pasa con nuestro personaje principal que junto con su perro Bullet (personaje increíble) irán desenmascarando los secretos del bosque y del propio pasado de a quien controlamos. Es una trama muy enrevesada, que te puede perder por la cantidad de detalles que tiene pero cuando vas uniendo todos los eslabones te das cuenta de lo que realmente pasó y pasa. Tiene varios finales posibles dependiendo de las decisiones que tomemos durante esta oscura aventura.
Cabe destacar que este juego transcurre en el año 1996, dos años después de los sucesos de la película del año 1999 ""The Blair Witch Project"", y varios conceptos y detalles de esta obra se mantienen en la trama.

[b]Gráficos:[/b] No es un apartado que destaque demasiado aunque es un motor gráfico que va muy bien por lo que ofrece el juego, los detalles se pueden apreciar y es agradable a la vista. Se disfruta mucho más a altas resoluciones y tiene opción de ReShade que deja un buen sabor de boca a los aspectos del lugar en el que transcurre todo.

[b]Ambientación:[/b] Bueno... el 85% del juego nos encontramos en el famoso bosque de Black Hills, en donde pasan la mayoría de sucesos. En muchas ocasiones vamos a sentir esa sensación de soledad constante, de no saber si alguien (o algo) nos está acechando desde las sombras, además los escenarios en algunas partes se vuelven un laberinto ya que avanzamos pero volvemos al mismo lugar de donde empezamos, y eso añade un aura de misterio e incertidumbre. Tenemos también la opción de investigar y recorrer los senderos para obtener pistas y objetos que nos ayuden con nuestra misión. El bosque, de todos modos, está muy bien recreado, es ENORME pero la linealidad del juego hace que este detalle no esté tan presente. En el tramo final, [spoiler]concretamente en la parte de la cabaña abandonada del bosque,[/spoiler] creo que consiguieron obtener un buen resultado, que va mezclando acontecimientos del presente [spoiler]con situaciones del pasado de nuestro personaje y ahí entendemos bastantes aspectos de la trama[/spoiler]. Esta última etapa, siento que estuvo fuertemente influenciada por la [spoiler]fórmula adoptada por Capcom para lo que fue Resident Evil VII[/spoiler]. También hay que agregar que estamos en una puja constante entre la relación tiempo-espacio, donde la realidad muchas veces queda perdida y no sabemos en qué situación nos encontramos.

[b]Jugabilidad:[/b] Se nota que han tomado muchos aspectos de otros juegos del género, como por ejemplo Alan Wake y Outlast. Para derrotar a los enemigos tendremos que usar una linterna, ya que la luz es la ""munición"" principal del juego, y también contaremos con una videocámara que nos va a ayudar en situaciones concretas y para alterar el espacio-tiempo antes mencionado. Nuestro perro Bullet tiene ciertas funcionalidades que nos ayudarán con las pistas y a seguir el camino principal, pero son funciones bastante desaprovechadas ya que el propio título te va llevando casi de la mano hacia donde debes ir y en la mayoría de las ocasiones el perro no nos sirve para mucho, sólo para acompañarnos (y eso si, es una gran compañía).

[b]Sonido:[/b] No es un apartado que juegue un rol fundamental pero está muy presente debido a muchos efectos sonoros repartidos por la aventura. Los sonidos nos pueden ayudar a evitar situaciones de peligro, nos permitirá estar atentos a la actividad del perro para saber si encontró algo o si se perdió, y también jugará como herramienta para mantenernos en tensión en ciertas zonas, en donde algunas voces nos van a hablar, o también para escuchar sucesos que sirven como flashbacks. 

[b]Factor terror:[/b] No es un juego que recurra a viejos trucos como jumpscares o screamers, pero podés estar en tensión en varias situaciones debido a que no sabemos qué nos podemos encontrar, o porque estamos esperando que pase algo que luego no ocurre. El horror aparece a través de otros elementos o detalles más sutiles que también fui explicando, pero creo que lo que más está presente es la duda, el misterio de lo que nos espera más adelante o de lo que realmente está ocurriendo a nuestro alrededor. Pero en sí, no es un juego que genere miedo.

Por una extraña razón, el juego no me dejó sacar capturas. No sé si es un fallo del comando o si simplemente fue un error mío o algo que imposibilitaba esta función, así que por eso no comparto imágenes de Blair Witch.

[b]Mi nota final: 7.5/10[/b]

(ну персонаж) а еще очень сильно оценил искажения реальности. Иногда бывало не понятно все это бред! или это проходит наяву. 

В целом игра получилась довольно интересной и увлекательно, было и страшно и жутко, мрачно.  получается что игра в плане сюжета вышла гораздо лучше чем сами фильмы ""Ведьме из Блэр"" так что стоит ознакомится

Hard to deny it being walking simulator with occasional item and notes collecting but wouldn't expect anything else as it fits. Phone games is nice addition.

As big fan of source material - ""The Blair Witch Project"" movie, I expected more insight into story, but focus is definitely shifted more to main character rather witch herself or missing kid, which is quite anticlimactic.

Spoilers ahead:
[spoiler]Main character is being delusively optimistic of search, which make it hard to follow and believe it's actually happening.

After credits there's summary of results of our actions results, which makes you believe everything we encountered was real, but it never felt like it was. Perhaps it was witch after all, who knows.

Characters backstory popups from time to time and feels out of place. Yes, it explains where his PTSD comes from and why he wants to help to find specific kid, but generally, it's not that important to events in game, it could be replaced or removed and you wouldn't notice. If you do collect all psychiatrist notes it becomes more clear where's connection between main character and witch: events was set in motion long time before events of the game, it's very easy to miss.

""Ведьма из Блэр: Курсовая с того света"" - Фильм 1999 года, который при бюджете в 60 тысяч долларов смог собрать свыше 245 миллионов и породив тем самым жанр «Найденная плёнка». 
Почему фильм имел такой успех и почему жанр «Найденная плёнка» стал на столько популярен? Ответь прост. В литературе давно существует такой жанр, как ""Эпистолярный роман"" (Дневник, записка) и вы скорей всего слышали о таких писателей, как Эдгар Алан По, Говард Лавкрафт, Франц Кафка и остальные. Если вкратце, то ""Эпистолярный роман"" это когда кто-то находит записку/дневник, в которой некогда пропавший при странных обстоятельствах субъект расписал за определенный период времени свою историю. Например, в рассказе ""Храм"" выше упомянутого Говарда Лавкрафта, Карл-Генрих фон Альтберг-Эренштейн, капитан подлодки U-29 оставил предсмертную записку о событиях, которых произошли за последние время на подлодке U-29 и что с ним и экипажем случилось. 
Но в кинематографе данный жанр до 1999 года был не популярен. Были работы до ""Ведьма из Блэр"", но они были грубо говоря на 4/10 и представляли собой незаконченный концепт. И когда в 1999 году вышел на первый взгляд простой хоррор-фильм ""Ведьма из Блэр: Курсовая с того света"", то тогда и началось. 
Про влияние на массовую культуру я говорить не буду, ибо целью выше сказаного является примерное понимание важности этого фильма на популяризацию жанра. В том числе и в игровой индустрии.
Blair Witch, игра которую я прошел еще в год ее выхода и перепрошел недавно и на днях. Я хочу поведать лишь об одной, сугубо для меня, особенности - лес, как неизвестность.
Лес - как место. Как существо. Как явление. Как совокупность нашей фантазии, известной и неизвестной реальности для человека. Каждому из нас говорили в лес не ходить или там опасно. Но как часто вы были в лесу? Думаю для тех кто живет рядом с ним или были в нем ночное время суток, лес является некой тайной, покрытое мистикой. А если вы еще и в глуши, то добро пожаловать к старым мистическим небылицам местных возле костра. Это темное место, смотря вглубь коего тебя затягивает темнота неизвестности. Мы не видим ничего в темноте и мозг, начинает придумывать свою реальность. Свой мир, покрытый кровавыми деревьями души забредавших сюда. И это я обожаю)
Лес для меня, как белый лист бумаги, ты знаешь про флору и фауну характерные ему, и даже можешь мыслить объективно с холодной головой, но попадая туда, ох...  теперь твоя фантазия управляет тобой. Страх неизвестного, особенно в ночное время рисует тебе свою гиперболизированную реальность, что сказывается на психике, следовательно на действиях с вытекающими последствиями. 
Думаю на этом обзор можно закончить. Да, именно лесом. Если у вас хорошая фантазия и вы можете погрузиться в пучину неизвестности ночью. один, то эта игра для вас.
Но хочу сказать о большом минусе игры, это ее последняя четверть. Очень плохая последняя глава и среднии, нелогичные концовки.
Для других, кто не может норм погуглить инфу про продукт, который они приобретают и  кому нужны глупые плюсы и минусы. 
Плюсы (Субъективно): 
+ Атмосфера.
+ Графон.
+ Геймплей.
+ Собака:)
+ Головоломки (Не все).
+Лес, как место действия.

Минусы (Субъективно):
- Сюжет (Он изначально ни на что не претендовал).
- Последняя глава.
- Геймдезайнерские решения в некоторых местах.
- Концовки.

esos 3 puntos me parece que son geniales pero la IA del perro es algo torpe, le dices que busque  y aveces no encuentra el rastro , las cintas de vídeo son un poco desorientadoras , pasas por los lugares que te enseñan y no se encuentran y fuera de eso te adentran en un pequeño laberinto donde te desorientas, de echo los caminos no tienen mucho sentido, me gusta la historia que te presentan pero como juego fatal.",

que se passa algum tempo após os eventos do filme, aqui no game vamos jogar com 
Ellis um ex policial que se junta a uma busca por um garoto que se perdeu na floresta 
da black hills, aquela fatídica floresta onde ocorre o filme.
O jogo foi desenvolvido pela bloober team que fez jogos como layers of fear e the medium,
e foi lançado em 2019.

Eu quando mais novo assisti o filme antigo da bruxa de blair e na época e até hoje muita gente 
acha que aquilo realmente aconteceu, a propaganda na época do filme foi muito boa para ter 
o boom que ele teve, muito depois teve um novo filme da bruxa de blair que assisti também e aqui no jogo senti 
muito a vibe do filme que irei comentar.

Aqui no jogo nessa busca por esse garoto, vamos ter em nossa companhia o nosso cachorro 
chamado Bullet e bom no início do jogo nosso personagem está indo de carro para a floresta 
e paramos o carro em um lugar onde outros policiais já tinham começado a busca pelo garoto,
ali conosco temos um celular, um walkie talkie que ao decorrer do jogo vamos nos comunicando 
com os policiais na floresta e depois encontramos uma câmera que vai ser de grande uso 
também durante a jogatina.
Bullet é bem importante pra você, ele encontra pistas, traz objetos perdidos, fareja e vai atrás 
de alguma coisa, late quando ver algo estranho, é um grande auxílio e ótima companhia, podemos fazer 
carinho nele e dar alguns petiscos além de outras interações que possui.

O nosso personagem tem vários traumas do seu passado além de um conturbado término de relacionamento
com Jess que conversamos bastante via celular durante o jogo, com o decorrer da jogatina vamos 
cada vez mais descobrindo mais coisas sobre Ellis.
As interações com os outros personagens basicamente vai ser dessa maneira via walkie talkie ou pelo 
celular.

E sobre o restante do jogo o que podemos comentar ?
Cara, o jogo tem uma atmosfera muito boa, o início é um pouco lento e você vai se sentir perdido 
em várias partes, a floresta é macabra e misteriosa e você não ver nenhum animal ali é como se 
a floresta tivesse afastado eles, o sentimento de ficar perdido e não saber para onde ir é meio 
que normal ali, e no filme tem muito disso onde a galera fica muito tempo andando para algum lugar 
para tentar sair da floresta e quando vai ver apenas andou em círculos e aqui acontece a mesma coisa, haha.
Me senti muito no filme, é desorientador essa floresta.
O gráfico é de mediano para bom, eu achei bonito a maior parte das coisas.
A parte do design de som colabora muito pra deixar você mais imersivo ali, isso junto com 
jogar de fone de ouvido e a noite... cara é doidera viu, e foi exatamente assim que joguei.
A atmosfera que vai se construindo ao longo do jogo só vai melhorando e quando chega no capítulo 
final fica frenético, a parte que você entra na casa da bruxa que é no último capítulo é insana,
é praticamente 1 hora ali dentro naquela atmosfera claustrofóbica, tudo escuro e com vários corredores 
pequenos e o som ambiente é bom demais.
Levei alguns sustinhos e algumas arrepiadas no jogo, porém já estou meio acostumado a sustos 
por assistir e gostar muito de filmes de terror, mas com certeza pessoas que não são acostumadas com isso 
podem ter uma experiência bem mais aterrorizante.
O jogo também tem legenda pt-br para entender melhor da história.

De negativo, o que posso falar ?
Eu não achei muito intuitivo algumas coisas do jogo, 
apesar de ter poucos controles e ser meio simples tem umas partes 
que eu ficava rodando e rodando sem saber o que fazer ou para onde ir.
Talvez seja burrice minha, pode ser... Mas senti isso jogando.
Ficava vendo e revendo as fitas na câmera andando pra lá e pra cá tentando descobrir 
o que era pra fazer, é algo que queria falar.
A história também achei meio confusa, teve partes que achei que tinha entendido e depois 
já não estava entendendo nada novamente, li todas as anotações e interagi com muitas coisas 
mas ainda assim não sei se entendi tudo como deveria.
O começo é meio lento, mas depois engrena bem, ainda mais chegando perto do final.
A duração do jogo é pequena, isso pode ser bom para algumas outras pessoas e para outras não,
eu gostaria que fosse um pouquinho maior e com mais partes assustadoras desde mais cedo no jogo.
Terminei por volta de 6 horas ele.
E citando parte assustadora, assim como no filme, não vemos também 'a bruxa', mas gostaria 
de ter visto mais parte das criaturas que aparecem no jogo ou ter explicado um pouco mais delas,
o que são, se são parte da imaginação dos traumas do Ellis ali na floresta que ficou maior, se são criações da bruxa e 
etc, mas tudo bem.

Sinto que o jogo poderia ter sido melhor, não que seja ruim, ele é bom e gostei, mas poderia ter dado um tchan a mais 
deixando as coisas melhores explicadas e colocado mais partes tensas, sabe quando você ver algo ou faz algo 
que sente que teve algum desperdício de ideia boa ? Foi o que senti.
Recomendo o jogo e obviamente em uma promoção ainda mais por ele ser bem curtinho, e se você já assistiu bruxa de blair vai ter lembranças e uma experiência ainda melhor se teve contato com os filmes.",

In the realm of horror games, few titles manage to capture the essence of fear and psychological torment as effectively as ""Blair Witch."" Bloober Team's interpretation of the iconic Blair Witch franchise is a roller-coaster ride of terror that successfully translates the eerie atmosphere of the films into an interactive and nerve-wracking gaming experience. While not without its flaws, this game offers a captivating journey into the heart of darkness, making it a must-play for horror enthusiasts.

""Blair Witch"" nails the unsettling ambiance that defines the franchise. The game's forest setting is cloaked in an air of dread, with dense woods, misty trails, and eerie sounds creating an atmosphere of constant unease. The graphical fidelity is commendable, with detailed environments and a clever use of lighting and shadows to evoke a sense of impending doom. The transition between the familiar and the surreal is seamless, leaving players perpetually uncertain about what's lurking in the shadows.

The game's narrative is a worthy addition to the Blair Witch mythos, albeit occasionally convoluted. Players step into the shoes of Ellis, a former police officer searching for a missing boy in the Black Hills Forest. As the story unfolds, it delves into Ellis's troubled past, intertwining it with the witch's history. The psychological horror elements shine here, as the game blurs the line between reality and hallucination, forcing players to question their perceptions.

While ""Blair Witch"" excels in creating an unsettling atmosphere, its game-play mechanics occasionally fall short. The use of a camcorder to solve puzzles and reveal hidden clues is a unique touch, but it can also feel cumbersome and disorienting. The loyal canine companion, Bullet, is a standout addition, providing emotional support and assistance in navigating the forest. However, some interactions with Bullet can be hit or miss, leading to moments of frustration.

The core strength of ""Blair Witch"" lies in its ability to induce genuine fear and anxiety. The game capitalizes on psychological horror, often leaving players questioning their own sanity. The forest becomes a character in itself, breathing with a malevolent presence that preys on fears and insecurities. Jump scares are expertly timed, and the constant feeling of being watched adds an incredible layer of tension. In VR, this immersion reaches an entirely new level of terror, making it an experience not for the faint-hearted.

Lastly, ""Blair Witch"" is a commendable entry in the horror game genre, successfully capturing the essence of the franchise's eerie atmosphere and psychological terror. While some game-play mechanics can be clunky and the narrative occasionally confusing, the game's ability to induce genuine fear and its masterful use of atmosphere make it a standout title. Whether you're a fan of the films or a horror gaming enthusiast in search of a spine-chilling experience, ""Blair Witch"" will take you on a terrifying journey into the unknown that you won't soon forget.

The art style may lack personality, but Bloober certainly knows how to make a game nice and easy on the eyes. The gameplay is always minimal and inoffensive, unless you're the kind of person who can't abide any devs makin' them terrible walking sims. I don't mind a short, simple, narrative-driven game at all. The problem with Bloober is always the story. By this point they must realize that to some people - me included - they come across as absolute a-holes. ""Blair Witch"" might be the most glaring example of that because the player is essentially asked to sympathize with a white cop who 'accidentally' murdered an unarmed kid. I'll make an excuse for the writers: ""Blair Witch"" has been released pre-George Floyd, and was created by a Polish team. Say what you will about Polish police force, but it isn't yet known for rampant killings. (That's about all positive things I can say about them at this time.) So yeah, I'm going to say that Bloober just recklessly copy-pasted a known trope which they probably learned as kids from Hollywood films. However, our main dude has also done some other bad stuff that is revealed later in the game. If Bloober wanted us to empathize or get invested in the man's redemption, well, they maybe shouldn't have made him THIS awful. Now, this issue happens in other Bloober games as well: they generally write all people as either absolute a-holes or helpless victims, and on some occasions - both at the same time. What's new in ""Blair Witch"" is that they decided to punish the players for playing the game. What, you thought you are meant to interact with the environment, explore and pick up collectibles? Nah, you do that and you'll get a bad ending. As a matter of fact, I don't think many people will get a good ending without consulting a walkthrough. So, say you get one of the bad endings like me. What's next? Another playthrough to get a good ending, right? Hah, as if! ""Blair Witch"" is possibly the least replayable game you can imagine: it takes forever to get anywhere, it's slow, the gameplay is minimal, and the pacing drags a little even on the first playthrough. So no, you will likely just do what I did: read about the other endings, shake your head, uninstall, initiate the memory erasure protocol, never think or speak of ""Blair Witch"" ever again. Not because it was terrible, but because it wasn't fun enough.

P.S. Oh, the dog! The dog was cute. If we could rescue him and put him in a better game, that would be the best ending for poor Bullet.","Every Bloober game I've played felt like I could almost recommend it, but ultimately I kind of hated it.

Ignorando lo anterior:  el juego abusa de la oscuridad, y la sensación de extravió para lograr angustia en el jugador, lo cual termina por cansar, hay momentos en que no ves nada de los bordes de la pantalla y tu visión se reduce a un tunel oscuro, en el que fluctua la luz, por momentos resulta, pero al final cansa. El sonido es magnifico.

Zu Beginn muss ich gleich mal sagen, dass ich keinen der ""Blair Witch""-Filme wirklich gut fand. Die Crossover-Spiele von [i]Terminal Reality[/i] aus den 2000ern hingegen, die irgendwie mit Nocturne zusammen hangen, fand ich damals aber ganz OK.
Dieses Spiel hat aber, bis auf diese komische erfundene Hexensage, keinen (für mich) erkannbaren Bezug zu beidem.

Ich mochte das lockere Gameplay, die Atmosphäre und die Hintergrundgeschichte dieses Spiels.
Wirklich gruselig fand ich es zwar nicht, aber dass man einen streichelbaren Hund als Begleiter dabei hat, hat für mich grundlegend alles andere nicht so wichtig gemacht und passte dabei noch gut zu der Story.

Man sollte eine gewisse Toleranz gegenüber der verbesserungsfähigen Übersetzung der deutschen Texte mitbringen oder das ganze einfach komplett auf englisch spielen.
Lustigerweise wurde pet mit Haustier übersetzt, was ohne jeglichen Kontext ja erstmal nicht falsch ist. Wenn man mit diesem Kommando allerdings als Belohnung den treuen Schäferhund streicheln will, dann ist es halt schon irgendwie nicht wirklich richtig. Was zudem dazu noch besonders auffällig ist, da dies als Aktion im alle paar Minuten wiederkehrenden Ringmenü auf dem Bildschirm auftaucht.
Zudem kann es auch mal passieren, dass die Hauptrolle von seiner ehemaligen Geliebten in den auf deutsch übersetzten SMS gesiezt wird. Was entweder darauf hinweist, dass man einen Adelsabkömmling aus dem Mitttelalter spielt oder dass halt auch der Google-Übersetzter mal einen schlechten Tag haben kann.

Im großen und ganzen fand ich das Spiel aber sehr unterhaltsam, auch wenn ich es nicht für die vollen 30 Euro außerhalb eines Sales kaufen würde.",

De hecho, lo mas parecido a experimentar blair witch  en formato video juego lo pueden encontrar en titulos menores (y hasta independientes) como slender the arrival (menores) y the woods (independiente....y si asi se llamaba el título)
O, desde el vamos, pueden optar por conseguir los 3 primeros juegos que se hicieron sobre esta franquicia para PC en un formato mas resident evil/alone in the dark (trilogía que tb se distancia bastante de la película...por no decir por completo....y sin embargo, en esos casos, la diferencia funciona mejor)

Caso contrario, lo que espera aqui (basado en el lore) un escenario de bosque, una camara de video que sera parte de nuestro inventario y pequeños retazos de algun que otro detalle de la película (y, cuyos momentos, es donde uno se agarra la cabeza y piensa ""porque no fueron x aca?"" el resto, una historia que con el correr del tiempo se va tornando una mas del monton y monótona.

Como ya mencionaron en otros comentarios, si deciden hacerse con el juego por el nombre y lo que (deberia) representar...les espera un chasco. 
Si por el contrario, bajan las expectativas y lo juegan como un juego de terror mas de los que se pueden encontrar en steam, probablemente se disfrute un poco más a la par que se olvide al muy poco tiempo después...

I'll start off with criticisms to get them out of the way. 

1. The game by design at times will send you in a loop, this feels authentic within the blair witch lore. However at times its frustrating and the mechanics are a little messy. It's easy to get stuck in sections with the game giving you no clear way to progress. Not very gamer friendly , we all like a challenge but we need to understand the objective to. 
2. The game in my opinion throws you too much information story wise and without spoiling it lets just say the 'twist' isn't a twist at all and you literally see it coming from an hour or two in , leaving you feeling a bit unsatisfied by the end. 
3. it's too short to leave any kind of real lasting impression, and as mentioned above its unsatisfying by the end. So short and not very sweet. 
4. It's to easy difficulty wise, I didn't die once. The real difficulty is finding your objective and the correct path that is literally it. 

now the positives 

1. looks great and plays great.
2. is actually decently scary in parts , it can go from 0-100 quick and that gets the heart going. 
3. The dog is the best addition in the game and a safety net that grounds you through the entire experience. 
4. The final level is great , i feel as if the devs put in the most work there.

So 50/50 good experience , wouldn't pay anything more than £10 for it though.

	Bloober Team's Blair Witch is a deeply atmospheric psychological thriller game. It's not invasively scary, as the focus is placed on building the environement of uncertainity and dread. The grim, dark, moody forrest is a background for exploration of our protagonist's troubled past and traumas. That's why the pace of the game is rather slow. Action oriented players might be deterred from it. Also, the ending unfortunately drags, falling into tedium as it relies on too many overused horror cliches.

	The game makes continuous references towards the first movie. Not only through story remarks but also through it's gameplay. Reviewing lost footage on camera allows player to interact with the world in an innovative way.

	Blair Witch exploration relies heavily on our trusted companion – a dog named Bullet. Even though his pathing sometimes glitches, the dog is an essential part of gameplay.

	This is a nieche title. Intended for people interested in exploring more advanced themes of human psychology. It's also a rewarding experience for the fans of the original film. And to those people...

	I recommend this game

As you navigate through the dense forest, the trees seem to close in around you, and you can never quite shake the feeling that you're being watched. The game does an excellent job of building tension and suspense, using sound effects, lighting, and other techniques to keep you constantly on edge.

But it's not just the atmosphere that makes the Blair Witch game so terrifying. The game also features some genuinely frightening supernatural creatures that will have you jumping out of your seat. Whether it's the eerie ghostly figures that appear in the mist, or the twisted and distorted monsters that stalk you through the forest, every encounter with these creatures is a heart-pounding experience.

One of the most innovative and thrilling aspects of the game is the way it uses your own fears against you. The game is full of psychological tricks and mind games that will make you question your own sanity. For example, there are moments when the game will make you doubt whether you're really alone in the forest, or whether there's something watching you from the shadows.

블레어위치는 영화 블레어위치로부터 영감을 받아 만들어진 1인칭 공포물 입니다. 정말  말 그대로 영감만 받았기에 시리즈의 상징적인 모티브만 가져왔으며 실제 스토리와 주인공, 내용등 영화의 핵심적인 시놉시스와는 전혀 상관이 없는 오리지널 작품입니다. 따라서 영화의 내용을 게임으로 혹은 영화의 배경을 게임으로 이식한것을 기대하고 하신다면 다소 실망할 수 있다는 점을 미리 짚고 가겠습니다. 

블레어위치는 실종소년 피터 섀넌을 찾기위해 전직 경찰관 엘리스와 그의 충견 불릿(경찰견 이름)이 어둡고 음침한 미지의 버킷츠 빌 숲을 수색하는 공포 미스테리 장르입니다. 인디 공포라는 장르의 특성상 5시간 내외의 플레이 타임과 다소 단순한 컨텐츠모델을 보여줍니다. 

(스포를 방지하기 위해 최대한 인 게임 정보를 배제했습니다.)

전체적으로 게임이 멋드러지게 만들어졌습니다.  하나하나 살펴 보자면 먼저 스토리가 준수하다는 생각이 들었습니다. 분명히 특출난 스토리는 아닙니다. 참신하지도 신선하지도 않은 스토리와 전개지만 전체적인 짜임새가 구멍이 없으며 개연성 부족에서 기인하는 몰입도 저해 같은 요소가 없습니다. 또한 현대 서양 공포 영화와 게임에서 익숙하게 사용된 작법과 연출법 그리고 시스템중 우수한 요소들을 잘 차용하여 적재 적소에 배치 함으로서 익숙하고 안정적인 왕도 공포물의 전형을 보여줍니다. 장르물에게 가장 중요한 장르 정체성 적인 부분에서 확실히 결함 요소가 없다는 것은 저예산 인디 게임에서는 큰 장점이지요.  특히나 후반부의 연출 전개를 꽤나 멋진 비주얼과 애프터 이펙트로  그려내며 주인공의 내면 심리를 깊이있게 그려낸 점이 인상깊었습니다. 그래픽역시 훌륭합니다. 구동에 있어서 스터터링 혹은 팝인 현상이 거의 눈에 띄지 않았으며 비주얼 적으로도 깔끔해서 환경 자체만으로 공포감을 조성하는데 어느정도 성공했다고 생각됩니다. 버그나 최적화 부분도 엔딩까지 한번도 나타나지 않았기에 저는 만족스러웠습니다. 다만 게임을 처음 구동 함에 있어서 본작의 언리얼엔진 4.21 버전의 네트워크 프로토콜인 OpenSSL 프로토콜이 인텔 11세대 이후 cpu와의 호환성 문제로 구동이 되지 않는 문제가 있기에 해당 게임의 스팀 토론에 가서 문제 해결 법을 참고하여 간단한 환경변수를 추가해주어야 한다는 점은 좀 아쉽습니다. 

단점역시 분명히 존재합니다. 플레이타임이 짧은 편에 속함에도 게임 플레이타임 내내 플레이 자체가 상당히 루즈하단 생각을 지울수가 없었습니다. 스토리가 준수하고 그래픽이 준수하고 가시적인 요소들은 큰 흠이없음에도 게임의 플레이 모델  , 즉 컨텐츠 설계가 미묘하게 밸런스가 맞지 않아서 지루함이 배가 된것 같습니다. 좀더 짧아도 될 구간임에도 필요 이상으로 연출을 통한 인물의 감정선과 서사 전달을 강조하기 위해 반복적인 행위가 많았으며 의도적으로 시간을 끌도록 만든 요소들도 그 방식이 너무 단조로워서 필용악적인 부분을 효과적으로 처리하지 못했습니다. 한가지 예를 들어 보자면, 한 챕터의 핵심적인 퀘스트가 특정 장소로 이동하면서 각종 심령 이벤트를 관전하는 것이 대부분이라 플레이어가 하는 것은 실제로는 그저 어떤 한 장소에서 다음 장소로 이동하는 것 그뿐입니다. 그 자체만으로도 플레이 모델이 지루하지만 이 지루한 플레이 모델의 동선과 경로가 불필요할정도로 길며 그 긴 구간 내에 트리거성 이벤트 역시도 적어서 지루함이 두배가 됩니다. 여기에 추가적으로 길찾기 난이도를 높여서 직관적으로 무엇을 하며 어디로 가야하는지 캐치하기도 힘들기에 플레이어의 인내심을 많이 테스트 하는 느낌을 받을수 있습니다.  이런 길찾기 난이도와 긴 동선을 통해 플레이 타임을 늘리는 필요악성 수를 효과적으로 커버하기 위해선 해당 동선 내에 부가적인 이벤트나 트리거 혹은 환경적인 스토리 텔링 요소들등 한마디로 '볼거리'를 늘리는 것이 중요한데 이런 부분에서 아주 엉망 까진 아니지만 다소 아쉬운 점이 남았네요. 차라리 과감하게 동선을 분할하고 퀘스트분량을 분할하여 좀더 플레이경험이 단순하지만 짧고 다양한 경험을 하도록 하는 편이 효과적인 안배가 아니였을까 생각이 들었습니다. 

스토리가 초반부에 지나치게 난해한점도 진입장벽을 높이는데 한몫 했다고 생각이 들지만 플레이 타임 자체가 짧고 후반부 부터 꽤나 주인공의 행동동기와 배경 사건만큼은 상세히 공들여서 다루기에 아주 큰 단점은 아니라 생각이 들었습니다. 

한마디로 요약하자면 작가주의적 성향이 강한 개발진들이 꽤나 공을 들여서 만든 인디 수작 공포게임이라 생각이 듭니다. 개발진들 자체가 전작 레이어스 오브 더 피어에서도 보여줬듯 게임을 통한 연출과 표현에 있어서 예술적인 접근을 많이 시도하기에 이것이 양날이 검이 된것 같습니다. 본인의 취향이 맞는다면 인디 기준 수작은 된다 생각하지만 취향이 맞지 않는다면 초반부를 넘기는게 힘들 것 같네요. 종합적으로 할인 시즌에 구매한다면 시도해볼만한 작품이라 생가이 듭니다.",

Its sooooo long, repetitive, and it makes me want to just keep running through to get it over with instead of soaking it in. Also with the military flashbacks, beating that dead horse.

[u]The Intro[/u]

I've heard some pretty bad things about this game, so my expectations were lowered. To my surprise though, i actually really enjoyed this game. 

I've seen and really enjoyed both Blair Witch movies, and this title isn't much different.

[u]The good stuff[/u]

You can clearly see that this is graphically a really pretty game. A higher budget on this title, which helped a ton. The whole forest and flashlight effects are just absolutely stunning and come very very close to reality.

The game has good dialogue, good voice acting, graphics, atmosphere, sound. So much about this game is really good.
The mechanics are also fun, you have a backpack, flashlight, walktie-talkie, phone you can call people on and receive texts, you have a dog companion with you that you can pet and give commands to, a camera you can watch tapes on and alter reality to progress, there's tons of cool collectibles. It's all well done.

The story is pretty decent with a nice plot-twist at the end that i didn't see coming.

[u]The bad stuff[/u]

The only part where the game somewhat sucked in my opinion was at the end when you're in the [spoiler]house[/spoiler] location. You get a ton of layers of fear like madness that just ceases to be scary and just continues to drag on and on.
The game also starts to drag on very mildly at around the 75% mark.

Also what is unfortunate is that the game occasionally throws at you these enemies encounters and you can actually defeat them. Don't get me wrong it's pretty cool, but it unfortunately takes away from the scary unsettling atmosphere when it happens, you don't feel as vulnerable.

Other than the Blair Witch, the story also focuses on the past of the main character. While this isn't a huge deal, it definitely is a less interesting story than that of the Blair Witch. Fortunately the game somewhat recognizes that and most of the time it's focused on the Blair Witch. 

[u]Final Thoughts[/u]

Overall I'd say this game is definitely worth a try if you like unsettling walking simulators with a great atmosphere and sound design! Plus this one comes with a high budget, which is very welcomed! :)

I will definitely play this game more times!

1. Primera y segunda parte del juego: buena, entretenida, con sentido, cosas para buscar, historias para leer, cosas por hacer.
2. Tercera parte del juego: muy bizarra, innecesariamente larga, redundante, muy fumada, no hay nada que buscar ni hacer, sin sentido.
3. Finales: dicen que tiene 4, para mi solo tiene dos, y es un mismo momento que cambia, no hay caminos diferentes para llegar a ellos, final muy pobre para el juego.

En cuanto a gráficos: buenos | Jugabilidad: bastante bien | Historia: la dos primeras partes: bastante bien

No es el gran juego, y la última parte si se hace muy densa, me pareció que no supieron como seguirlo, y te quedas casi una hora atorado dando vueltas innecesarias y sin sentido, esa parte decepciona, esperaba más del final, mucho más contenido.

Al juego global de acuerdo a mi experiencia con el le pongo 7, no más.

So steht es dort droben geschrieben, allein ich kann es nicht nachvollziehen.
""Inspiriert"" sein mag es durchaus, wenn man Wald + Wackelkamera + komische Geräusche als ""Inspiration durch einen genialen Film"" bezeichnen mag. Naja.

Das es meine Reaktionen auf Angst und Stress beobachtet, hm... Ich hatte keine Angst bisher. Stress schon, in Mengen. Den aber nicht wegen des spieltechnischen Inhalts, sondern wegen Lücken, Unlogik, sinnlosem Herumrennen, Steuerung die mal eben nicht mehr funktioniert und der immerwährenden Frage ""was zum Teufel will der Entwickler jetzt von mir?!""
Ja das war Stress...und kein positiver.

Grafik ist okay und die Story vielleicht auch. Kann ich nicht groß beurteilen, weil ich nach 5 Stunden in Kapitel 7 endlos genervt das Handtuch geworfen habe. Ich habe mich bemüht, aber das Spielkonzept ist (für mich) undurchsichtig und alles andere als intuitiv.

Die Steuerung kann man nicht anpassen und sie hakt hinten und vorne. Mal geht's, mal nicht. (Tastatur verwendet).

Als ex Soldat mit starkem PTBS klinkt sich unser Protagonist in die Suche nach einem vermissten Kind ein. Unterwegs begleitet wird er durch seinen Hund, sowie ein Handy mit dem hin und wieder telefoniert oder SMSen empfangen werden können, und einem Funkgerät, dass meistens eh nicht funktioniert.
Soweit, so gut.

Im Wald angekommen wird es aber schnell nervig. Das Fadenkreuz, eigentlich nur ein winziger Punkt, ist stellenweise nur sehr schlecht auszumachen oder verschwindet mal eben komplett. Gegenstände die hilfreich sein könnten oder für Errungenschaften zählen, sind nur mühsam zu entdecken. Und wenn der Hund nicht jedesmal vor Angst kläffen oder winseln würde, wenn irgendwo so ein Gegenstand rumgammelt, dann hätte ich die allesamt locker übersehen.

Nachts ist es wahrlich stockfinster, die Taschenlampe funktioniert kurze Zeit, dann flackert sie ohne ersichtlichen Grund, und geht auch gerne mal aus. Realismus wegen Batterien? Könnte man vermuten, allerdings funktioniert die Lampe beim nächsten Mal wieder normal, also sind das dann wohl sich selbst aufladende Batterien. 

Den Hund kann man als Wegfinder vorausschicken, das ist auch gar nicht mal schlecht - nur der Weganzeiger des Hundes ist im Wald mitunter echt schlecht zu erkennen. Dreht man sich dann mal ein wenig um sich selbst, hat man den Salat, dann muss man sich echt anstrengen, den eigentlichen Weg auch wiederzufinden.

Macht man mal genervt eine Pause, oha, dann gibt es Spass - denn die Speicherpunkte sind so rar gesät, dass man ziemlich sicher das ganze Kapitel von vorne anfangen darf. Nervig. Zumal man nicht weiss, wann man ein Kapitel verlassen und das nächste betreten hat. Ja, es gibt da so ein kleines Zeichen das rotiert wenn es speichert, aber wenn man auf den Wald, den Hund, merkwürdige Geräusche, noch merkwürdigere Dinger die umherhuschen und die zu suchenden Hinweise achtet, übersieht man das schnell mal.

Apropos umherhuschende Dinger. Es gibt irgendwelche Gegner im Wald, deren Bekämpfung nur Fragezeichen hervorgerufen hat. Man soll sich wehren, aber so wirklich klappt das nicht. Also sich auf den Hund verlassen, der auch nicht wirklich weiss was er tun soll und dann sterben. Und wieder sterben. Und nochmal. Und gerade wenn man denkt, man wie soll ich dieses Sterben denn verhindern????? steht man wieder und es geht weiter. Hm ja, also irgendwie sinnfrei das alles.

Aktuell stecke ich in einem brennenden Teil des Waldes, muss von Steininsel zu Steininsel rennen um nicht angezündet zu werden, der Hund weiss nicht was er tun soll, Gegner kommen die ich nicht bekämpfen kann und schwupps lande ich in einer Flashbackszene aus einem Krieg in dem ich mal aktiv war, in brennenden Ruinen und mit Soldaten, die mir sagen ich soll ihnen helfen und nichts geht mehr. Nach rund einer Stunde voll genervtem Rumgerenne und Gerate was ich jetzt tun soll, habe ich dem Spiel eine Pause gegönnt. 
Nach dieser Pause, mit frischem Mut wieder hinein in den Wald, musste ich feststellen, dass ich das komplette Kapitel noch mal von vorne anfangen muss und das war dann der Punkt, an dem ich das Handtuch geworfen habe.
Ja, ein bißchen mitdenken und knobeln und auch auf sich allein gestellt sein ist okay, in solchen Spielen. Aber so unterirdisch...nein danke.

Den Hund fand ich gut und auch die Idee, mit der Kamera, die (wenn man es denn mal verstanden hat) irgendwie die Vergangenheit anzeigen kann. Hätte man aber deutlich mehr draus machen können.
Bloober hat mit Layers of Fear was Starkes abgeliefert, aber Blairwitch hat den Hype meiner Meinung nach nicht wirklich verdient.

Wenn es im Sale ist, für einen Appel und ein Ei, kann man es sich getrost mal kaufen. Aber generell kann ich es einfach nicht empfehlen.",

Se cercate un gioco horror in grado di tenervi col fiato sospeso e di farvi provare un esperienza di gioco immersiva e graficamente appagante, Blair Witch è il titolo che fa per voi. Basato sul celebre film horror degli anni 90, il titolo riesce a riproporre l`atmosfera claustrofobica e inquietante della foresta di Burkittsville, dove il protagonista, un ex poliziotto di nome Ellis, cerca di trovare un bambino scomparso.

Uno dei punti di forza di Blair Witch è senza dubbio la grafica. I dettagli degli alberi, delle foglie e delle radici, la resa degli effetti di luce e ombra, il cambiamento del tempo, tutto contribuisce a creare un ambientazione credibile e coinvolgente. L`utilizzo di una telecamera a infrarossi e di una torcia che illumina solo una piccola porzione dello schermo aiuta a creare un senso di claustrofobia e di insicurezza, aspetti che uniti ad ottimi sonori binaurali contribuiscono a creare un clima di tensione costante con picchi e discese frequenti.

Tuttavia, il gioco presenta anche alcuni difetti. In particolare, i puzzle risultano troppo semplici e poco impegnativi, cosa che potrebbe deludere i giocatori alla ricerca di difficoltà. Inoltre, la presenza costante di collezionabili, potrebbe risultare fastidiosa per chi cerca un`esperienza di gioco più immersiva in quanto riporta costantemente alla condizione di realtà rompendo l`atmosfera e spesso lasciando il giocatore girovagare in cerca di questi ultimi anzichè eventualmente per osservare dettagli utili ai fini della trama.

In definitiva, Blair Witch è un ottimo titolo a multifinale della durata di circa 6/7 che merita di essere giocato per la sua capacità di creare un ambientazione credibile e coinvolgente, capace di tenere il giocatore col fiato sospeso dall`inizio alla fine. Nonostante la semplicità dei puzzle e la presenza eccessiva di collezionabili, il titolo è in grado di offrire un`esperienza di gioco appagante e avvincente, a patto di sfruttare degnamente la capacità grafica che offre creando un ambiente adeguato alla fruizione, molto consigliato a tutti gli amanti del genere horror.",

[b] Відьма із Блер[/b]- трилогія фільмів які зняті у жанрі псевдодокументалки від першої особи про людей, які загубилися у лісі Беркітсвілля. Вони ходять по колу, не можуть ніяк вибратися і врешті-решт знаходять покинутий старий будинок, звідки вже не виберуться живими. 
[b] Тут ми маємо[/b] ігрову інтерпретацію, або скоріше окрему історію у всесвіті ""Відьми із Блер"" від знайомої нам студії Bloober Team. Я пройшов цю гру за 5,5 годин і ось що можу сказати:

[b] Сюжет: [/b]Головний герой Елліс зголосився піти добровольцем на пошук зниклого хлопчика, якого останній раз бачили поряд з лісом Блек-Хіллз, разом із своїм вірним псом [strike]Патроном[/strike] Буллетом нам доведеться обшукати значну частину лісу в пошуках зачіпок щодо зникнення дитини. Але ліс не такий простий як здається на перший погляд, серед місцевих ходять легенди про злу відьму яка заманює дітей до себе в дім і вбиває. Зав'язка непогана, але чим більше ви будете проходити гру - тим сильніше сюжет буде віддалятися від своєї початкової ідеї. (І не можу сказати, що це дуже добре)

[b] Ігролад:[/b] Типічна гра від Bloober Team - симулятор ходіння по лісу, інтерактування з різноманітними предметами, читання записок і збирання коллекційних предметів. Єдина нова механіка - це ваш власний ПЕС. Так, дійсно. Він зроблений досить непогано, виглядає живим і ви вірите, що у вас є своя собака. Присутнє колісо різноманітних дій - типу: погладити чи налаяти, дати команду ""шукати"" чи наказати, щоб він слідував поруч. Досить цікаво. Можна помітити, що значна частина бюджету на гру була вкладена саме в цю собаку.

[b] Графіка:[/b] Графіка тут дійсно крута, деталізовані текстури, обличчя персонажів і звісно ж Буллет. Все виглядає круто, як у справжній ААА (інша розмова, що я грав на мінімалках [i]про це потім[/i], але все одно виглядає досить круто). Графіка для хоррора це дуже важливо і тут з цим не підвели.

[b] Саундтрек:[/b] Також для хоррорів дуже важливий правильний саунд, який буде нагнітати все, що відбувається навколо. Це один з важливих елементів, який впливає на гравця. Тут з цим більш-менш, ембієнт наче і є непоганий, але можна було б краще. Особисто мені іноді не вистачало більш напружених треків. З ними було б тільки краще.

[b] Оптимізація:[/b] Не знаю чому, але оптимізація тут така собі. Мені довелось грати на мінімалках на своїй 1660 і процессорі Ryzen 5 5600x, зазвичай в мене сучасні ігри йдуть на високих налаштуваннях в 60 фпс, тут ми маємо гру 2019 року де були просадки іноді навіть на мінімалках до 55-45 (таке собі щастя) Маємо, що маємо. І те, що написано в рекомендованих 1070ті це нісенітниця. Я не вірю, що неможна було нормально оптимізувати цей проєкт.

[b] Як хоррор:[/b] Я б не назвав цю гру повноцінним хоррором, це скоріше триллер з бродінням по лісу і час від часу випалюванням монстрів ліхтариком як у Алан Вейк. Хоррор тут починається тільки в кінці гри, там були моменти які дали нормально так просратися. А так, це звичайна тема Bloober Team - про внутрішіні переживання головного героя і таке інше.

[b] В цілому:[/b] Гру рекомендую, на один раз пройти можна. Особливо якщо ви знайомі з трилогією фільмів ""Відьма із Блер"" вам буде цікаво побродити по тому самому лісу і зрештою по тому самому будинку відьми з Беркітсвілля. 

[u] Я пройшов цю гру від початку до кінця [/u]на своєму [url=https://www.youtube.com/@d1e.young_/featured] Ютуб каналі[/url], там я проходжу також різноманітні хоррори, як ААА так і інді проєкти.

resumen: si queres jugarlo porque te gusto la pelicula original, no le da la nafta para llegar a dar la sensacion que te da la pelicula en lo absoluto. Pero... Si lo queres jugar porque te llama la atencion el juego en si, pues si te lo recomiendo, ta bueno.

Yo vi que un perro acompañaba al prota y por eso compre el juego, por el perro: ¿Valio la pena? Si, me encariñe con Bullet. Dicen que hay distintos finales, tal vez el que me toco a mi no estuvo tan bien, pero yo intente dentro de todo ser fiel a lo que haria en la vida real (bueno, eso teniendo en cuenta que yo jamas iria solo a un bosque... aunque si escon Bullet tal vez si). Las primeras horas de juego son entretenidas, luego se pone un poco delirante el juego, donde no sabes que pasa, donde o cuando estas, el juego te confunde y te hace perder la linea general del argumento. 
Por otra parte, obviamente no tiene mucho de la esencia de la pelicula original, pero aun asi tiene partes que si me dieron miedo. De hecho, gracias a este juego entendi varias cosas sobre el miedo. Hay una parte en la que estas en la oscuridad noctuna del bosque y de la nada se escuchan ruidos, pasos acercandose, acechandote, y tu perro ladrando para todas partes, pero vos ni sabes que mierda es, porque al parecer nada te ataca. Bueno, esa es la parte de mas terror legitimo que tiene este juego, porque la parte final mas que miedo me dio tension y luego hasta me llego a hartar las bolas. Creo que sin saberlo, en aquella parte en la que se escuchan ruidos pero nada mas, captaron mejor la esencia original del filme que en el resto del juego. 
En conclusion parece Layers of Fear en medio del bosque pero con un poco mas de interactividad. No se si recomendarlo demasiado porque la ultima parte en serio que me molesto que sea tan larga y repetitiva (a lo layers of fear). 

Tambien me gusto esa reflexion acerca de como en el odio y la ira somos manipulados por el mal, crean o no en Dios, creo que tiene mucho de verdad esto, a veces nos corrompemos al dejarnos llevar por los sentimientos, como animales comiendose una carnada. Y cuando ya somos algo irreconocible, hasta nuestros seres mas queridos nos abandonan, ya no nos reconocen. Bueno, no es el mejor juego que jugue en mi vida, pero tampoco el peor.

Review: If you didn’t know, this game is inspired by the found footage film ‘The Blair Witch Project’. The game takes this concept and adds many interesting new elements to its story. Our main character is a very unreliable narrator and suffers from PTSD. The game starts with him driving to a forest to assist in a public search for a missing kid with his dog.  He starts out late though so he has to catch up with the search party in the forest and that’s when things take a turn for the worst. The game provides you with a walkie talkie, a phone, a camcorder and our good ol’ trusty flashlight. The game does a pretty good job of exploring his past through phone calls and conversations with the sheriff through the walkie talkie. But they do use flashbacks to explore his story in detail. The game has a very interesting mechanic where you can watch tapes scattered across the forest to rewind through events that will affect the environment. It’s a very creative mechanic which services the story all while making you question whether any of this is actually happening. I don’t want to say too much and spoil the plot but I can say that the plot is solid and the game still holds up pretty well even though it’s a bit old. It’s a fun addition to the Blair Witch lore and is a scary experience for fans and newcomers alike.","10/10

Its strongest point is in the final act, when the game becomes more linear, it has great effects  and sound design together with the voice acting and the story progresses much faster and events become sequential, making the game more enjoyable.

The game starts off well with wonderful atmosphere and what, to me, seemed to be promises of interesting game mechanics. You've got your video camera, your phone, your walkie talkie, and your dog. All of which seem like really fun tools that I can  use to interact with the world and solve puzzles. By the end of the game though, they all fall pretty flat. The camera allows for some cool visuals and few good puzzles but that's about it. the phone and walkie talkie are only used for exposition dumps or the occasional scare and I was pretty disappointed with how pointless your dog, bullet is. He makes for good company and is useful for the few ""combat"" sequences but there isn't much else. The segments where you scare the monsters away with your flashlight and bullet's help are the best sequences. But it happens like three times. 

None of that would matter much to me if the game had two things. Horror and a good story. But it doesn't. Not to me at least. I understand horror is quite subjective, but other than a few brief sequences, I wasn't scared. The somber atmosphere was the scariest part. The feeling of isolation was wonderfully creepy but by the end, it just became a haunted house. Going from room to room, jumpscare to jumpscare. Most bloober games are like this its why I struggle with liking them. I love 'The Medium' because it feels like the only bloober game that rises above this horribly stale formula.

As for the story... It has no reason to be a blair witch game. The story is just 'Layers Of Fear' recycled with PTSD and the blair witch lore pasted on top. The final hour and a half where this all became clear to me was a miserable slog because I just didn't care. I didn't care about Ellis' past because all these people he hurt were just names, not even close to being characters. And the ending. Just an hour of nonsense. Maybe it went over my head but I sure doubt there was anything to go over my head at all. Bloober teams claims that this was a passion project of their but I'm not feeling it. To be terribly honest it feels very thrown together in terms of story. 

Final remarks: The game is beautiful, has great atmosphere, some good music, a few good spooks, and cute doggi but that isn't enough to hold it up. It just becomes too awful by the end for me to care unfortunately. The game is also pretty short. I only got 6 hours out of it for 30 bucks. I'd maybe suggest it for 10 or 15$ but with how aggravated I was when I beat it, I wouldn't get it for free.","TLDR: An overpriced, visually beautiful, atmospheric, sometimes spooky game that starts out wonderfully and slowly grinds to a miserable halt.

None of that would matter much to me if the game had two things. Horror and a good story. But it doesn't. Not to me at least. I understand horror is quite subjective, but other than a few brief sequences, I wasn't scared. The somber atmosphere was the scariest part. The feeling of isolation was wonderfully creepy but by the end, it just became a haunted house. Going from room to room, jumpscare to jumpscare. Most bloober games are like this its why I struggle with liking them. I love 'The Medium' because it feels like the only bloober game that rises above this horribly stale formula.

As for the story... It has no reason to be a blair witch game. The story is just 'Layers Of Fear' recycled with PTSD and the blair witch lore pasted on top. The final hour and a half where this all became clear to me was a miserable slog because I just didn't care. I didn't care about Ellis' past because all these people he hurt were just names, not even close to being characters. And the ending. Just an hour of nonsense. Maybe it went over my head but I sure doubt there was anything to go over my head at all. Bloober teams claims that this was a passion project of their but I'm not feeling it. To be terribly honest it feels very thrown together in terms of story. 

Final remarks: The game is beautiful, has great atmosphere, some good music, a few good spooks, and cute doggi but that isn't enough to hold it up. It just becomes too awful by the end for me to care unfortunately. The game is also pretty short. I only got 6 hours out of it for 30 bucks. I'd maybe suggest it for 10 or 15$ but with how aggravated I was when I beat it, I wouldn't get it for free."

[b] Blair Witch - «интерактивный» хоррор, разработанный польской инди-студией Bloober Team авторов таких шедевров, как Layers of Fear и Observer. Blair Witch же был заявлен как попытка перезапустить бренд, основанный на старом фильме ужасов : «Ведьмы из Блэр». Но, увы, что-то пошло не так, и игра превратилась в заштампованную бродилку. Почему так? Сейчас подробно все распишу. [/b]

[h1] Сюжет [/h1]

[b] Не хочу спойлерить, но в сценарном плане игра просто проигрывает тому же Observer и Layers of Fear...Попытались в психологический триллер, но не дожали. Внутренние переживания и галлюцинации героя вообще не к месту. У меня за всю игру так и не появилось желание сопереживать главному герою. Антагонист, то есть тот самый зловещий лес, не раскрыт. Мотивы похищения мне не ясны. А концовки (их в игре 4 и каждая со своим условием получения) так вообще прямым текстом говорят, что весь путь был пройден зря. Сюжет не зацепил, так как разработчики постоянно пытаются давить на жалость.  [/b]

[h1] Игровой процесс [/h1]

[b] Игровой процесс в Blair Witch желает оставлять лучшего. Да, есть пара интересных механик с камерой и с собакой-напарником. Но к сожалению, реализованы они всего 2-3 раза за игру. Все остальное время нам придется бродить с фонарем по лесу, отпугивая его обитателей, попутно решая простенькие головоломки и собирая тотемы. Интерактив отсутствует. Игровой процесс быстро приедается.  [/b]

[h1] Графика и Тех.состояние [/h1]

[b] Красиво и кинематографично. Unreal Engine 4 могет!!! Но в игре и по сей день встречается множество багов, которые, скорее всего, уже никто и не исправит.... [/b]

[h1] Атмосфера и Звуковой дизайн [/h1]

[b] Все на весьма достойном уровне и крайне аутентично задумке. Особенно атмосфера ночного леса и заброшенного дома на холме. Все шуршит, живет своей жизнью, и ничего не видно). [/b]

[h1] Итог : [/h1]

[b] Интерактивный хоррор на деле оказался далеко не интерактивным. Я не испытываю восторга от игры, но и хейтить игру особо не за что. Средненький хоррор, на прохождение которого можно убить 7-9 часов свободного времени. И то только за неимением альтернативы и имея собственное желание. Кому я могу посоветовать данную игру? Любителям хорроров. Остальным же рекомендую лучше ознакомится с Layers of Fear или попробовать серию Outlast, а уже потом пробовать Blair Witch. Спасибо за внимание и всего наилучшего.  [/b]",

        [td]If I can think of one thing Blair Witch does right, it's the atmosphere and graphics. The game is absolutely stunning here. The forest is terrifying and makes you feel so immersed.

        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]
        [td]The gameplay is okay I guess. I do like the interactions you can do when grabbing objects and examining them. The dog mechanics are also well thought out and are pretty good. Having to interact with your phone, radio, and camera is such a great mechanic I don’t see well implemented in games that often and Blair Witch does it really well. Finding clues and using Bullet (the dog's name) to help you discover items was really fun and made Bullet seem useful and fun to interact with. You can also give Bullet snacks and pet him so that's pretty cool. There’s little to no sneaking in this game, and the monsters are pretty comedic and wasted potential. They are just so boring to go against in this game. I don’t want to spoil them but for the most part it’s mostly the same creature that all you have to do is flash your light on it, that’s it! The scare factor in this game dies down pretty quick once you realize that you mostly just walk in the woods and flash your light on the monster (don’t segments are so far and between, also really short). That you don’t have a sense of fear after nearly getting halfway through the game. Great gameplay mechanics, just poor enemies and little to no scare factor here.[/td]

        [td]The story is trash. I’m just gonna say it how it is. I was extremely disappointed with this game. Probably more than I should. The first two hours were so interesting and intense. Once the PTSD flashbacks came into the game, I was getting frustrated. The flashbacks take you out of the experience a lot. The main character is so boring and not interesting at all. Even his flashbacks were not that interesting. The “villain” is a complete clown in this game. I will now be talking about spoilers so you are warned. [spoiler]The main danger was a forestman in the woods that had gone insane. Such a stupid villain. Oh and the ""Witch"" is not a threat at all! You don't learn much at all about the Black Forest or the Blair Witch. Yeah they bring in some comments about the people from the original movie, but that's just to please the fans. The final fight was all cutscenes too. For a game called [b]""Blair Witch""[/b] you never see the Witch or feel her presence or danger.[/spoiler] If I had to add a positive, it’s that choices in the game do have an impact on the story and there are multiple endings. In conclusion, as there are some great things the story has in terms of choices and mechanics, It still felt like a waste of potential. They could have picked many different ideas that would have been way better here, and this is what they decided to do. An underwhelming story and a waste of time.

It’s fascinating to see how they screwed up like this.

129711906,spanish,2022.11.30 22:39,✅,❌,0.5,0,"Dicho en corto, otra maravilla más de Blooper Team. Blair Witch es un título de género terror que combina con aventura gráfica, una fórmula que ya hemos visto bastantes veces en gran parte de las creaciones de Blooper Team. 

La historia de este juego al inicio del   juego es bastante confusa, haciéndote sentir desorientado en todo momento obligandote el propio juego a dar tumbos de un punto a otro cual alma en pena, una mecánica que ya hemos visto en otros juegos como en la saga de Layers of Fear. En este caso nos pondremos en la piel de un policía que tiene varios traumas que tratar además de verse envuelto en una serie de desdichas. El lore de este título da a entender que lo ocurrido en este videojuego es posterior a lo ocurrido en la película.

Los personajes son pocos. Ante todo brillan Ellis y su compañero de aventuras Bullet. A medida que progresamos en la historia podemos ver como el personaje de Ellis se va haciendo cada vez más profundo y oscuro, lleno de dudas, incertidumbres y cicatrices resultantes de experiencias pasadas un tanto traumáticas. En todo momento nos centramos en Ellis y lo que parece ser su constante lucha por mantener un estado mental aceptable a medida que lucha con sus propios miedos y alucinaciones al mismo tiempo que está resistiéndose con los juegos mentales de la bruja de Blair. 

La música es bastante buena. Las pistas de audio incitan a una ambientación lúgubre, terrorífica en la que predomina la desesperanza y soledad. 

La ambientación es una de las estrellas de este título. El bosque está diseñado de manera que te sientas perdido en todo momento, hacaciendote sentir desorientado y pequeño ante las largas extensiones de senderos, árboles y matojos que parecen haber visto tiempos mejores. El día aboga a la calma y tranquilidad, haciéndote seguir seguro bajo la luz del sol. Sin embargo, a medida que ves caer este, sientes como un escalofrío recorre tu espalda y un sudor frío cubre tu frente ante la ineludible certeza de saber lo que está a punto de ocurrir... y no será bueno. La noche es perfecta, oscuridad por todas partes acompañada de un silencio que se ve interrumpido por los pasos de Ellis y algún que otro sonido causado por seres que te vigilan en todo momento a cada paso que das.

El gameplay es bastante simple: camina, investiga, se sigiloso y lucha por tu supervivencia. No tendrás que preocuparte por ser acechado en todo momento, sin embargo, cuando el juego te pida que seas sigiloso, debes de serlo. Además de eso, el procedimiento es el mismo que en Layers of Fear. En un par de ocasiones, habrán escenas de acción en las que, con linterna en mano como si de una pistola se tratara (Alan Wake, ¿Eres tú?), debes de encargarte de ahuyentar los seres que amenazan con poner fin a tu estadía en el bosque.

En conclusión, ¿Recomendaría este título? Si eres un jugador que le encanta una buena historia con temática de terror y que ha visto la película de la Bruja de Blair, un rotundo sí. El doblaje original, la el soundtrack, los efectos de sonido, los escenarios, ambientación e historias son prácticamente perfectos. Hecho de menos el que una vez que hayas terminado de jugar la historia por primera vez te den la capacidad de seleccionar el capítulo que quieras para poder platinar con cierta comodidad el juego aunque tampoco es muy extenso el juego ya que en cinco horas lo completas. Dicho esto, recomendaría encarecidamente ver antes la película de Blair Witch ya que hay una gran cantidad de elementos que te ayudan a ponerte en situación además de entender el modus operandi de la bruja de Blair. Ten cuidado a la hora de entrar al bosque ya que puedes no salir de el... ella se encargará de impedirlo por todos los medios.",

The story is about a kidnapped boy and you as a police officer set out with a crew to locate him. The story itself was decent and had a lot to do with suffering from PTSD. As a horror game it’s not really scary but more psychological horror which it’s good at. The story isn’t confusing to follow and was told well, tho towards the end I was kind of hoping the ending was coming, as the last hour of the game really stretched on.

Graphically the game looked great. It had good atmosphere and really good voice acting. But I did find some annoyances that really bothered me……

The dog - while it was nice to have a companion in the game you can interact with, have them fetch item, and help lead you in the right direction, it never stops barking. It started to drive me insane how much the dog barked and whined. It made my own dog start barking, so now I have 2 annoying dogs around me lmao.

The Forrest - the main part of the game is somewhat frustrating to navigate as it all looks the same and you need to find progression items which can involve some slight back tracking, all the while getting lost and going in circles. You will eventually learn the areas a bit but you never stay in those spots for too long.

Over all the game is decent and while it did have some annoying issues I enjoyed playing it. Just wish the dog would stfu.

This game plays terrible on steam deck and barely holds 30 fps so I ended up playing it on my pc.

It's not bad. It has some good moments, and we can see that work and care has been delivered into the game by the developers: The atmosphere is good, and the forest is a bit scary (initially).

Or maybe the game is a masterpiece. Its so realistic and faithful to his source material, that indeed accurately portraits being lost in a forest. And just like in real life, it's not a fun experience.

The Good:
- Great Atmosphere and creepy, situational music. 
- Impressive level design and seamless methods of making you run in circles in non linear ways. A+
- A very good boi that you can pet and give treats!

The Bad
- It just keeps droning on and on to little point or purpose. The last 1 hour is an endless cycle of corridors and jump scares, mixed with teleportation back at the start of the map, where the theme of 'LE TRAUMA' is stupidly hammered home like it wasn't the sole focus of every frame for the past 1 hour. For the love of God, yes we get it. LE TRAUMA
- Game mechanics are set up from the start to lead you the 'bad ending' forcing a replay.
- See above, you have entire sections of your inventory dedicated to collecting statues, but if you collect a single one you are doomed to the 'bad ending'.

125623512,italian,2022.10.17 16:25,✅,✅,0.5,0,"Prima di parlare nello specifico di Blair Witch, è necessario fare un salto indietro nel tempo al lontano 1999, anno in cui sbancò al botteghino The Blair Witch Project, film che possiamo definire ""rivoluzionario"" in quanto non solo ha dato il via a un filone di opere derivate ambientate nello stesso universo in cui prende luogo la pellicola, ma anche ai cosiddetti horror che sfruttano la tecnica ""found footage"". Al gioco in questione hanno lavorato gli ormai esperti e blasonati sviluppatori di Bloober Team, e il risultato finale è un autentico gioiellino nel panorama degli horror psicologici con forte impronta narrativa.

Burkittsville, 1996. Il giovane Peter Shannon, un ragazzino di 9 anni, scompare nel bosco di Black Hills, tristemente noto per la sua storia intrisa di sangue e mistero. Lo sceriffo locale organizza delle squadre di soccorso per ritrovare Peter, e alla spedizione si unisce Ellis, un ex poliziotto e veterano di guerra dal passato turbolento, spinto da motivazioni personali e alla ricerca di redenzione. Al suo fianco Bullet, un pastore belga dell'unità cinofila, dal fiuto infallibile e addestrato a seguire tracce. Come in ogni horror che si rispetti, quella che sembra un'indagine come le altre ben presto si rivela anticamera di un mistero molto più fitto e torbido...
Evitando spoiler, quella di Ellis è una discesa nella pazzia cadenzata, scandita da episodi di follia che dapprima possono essere attribuiti al PTSD di cui soffre il protagonista, ma che poi cominciano a divenire sempre più terrificanti e sovrannaturali. Blair Witch si identifica quindi con le storie a cui i ragazzi di Bloober sono avvezzi: racconti di follia, nei quali i drammi personali si fondono con un clima permeato da eventi inspiegabili.

Blair Witch non abbatte i canoni in cui sono specializzati i creatori di Layers of Fear, Observer, eccetera, ma si differenzia dalle altre creazioni del team in quanto porta in dote un gameplay un po' più vario, fornendo al protagonista un set di strumenti che consente di interagire con l'ambiente in modi diversi: una torcia elettrica, un walkie-talkie, un cellulare e una videocamera molto ""speciale"", ma qui ci arriviamo dopo. Infine, al fianco del nostro equipaggiamento c'è Bullet, che più che mero ""strumento"" possiamo definire ""amico"", di fatto la relazione tra Ellis e il suo fedele compagno è ben più di un semplice rapporto utilitaristico: l'ex poliziotto è un uomo solo, dilaniato dai sensi di colpa e da un passato tormentato, e trova nel suo compare canino un'ancora di salvezza per non sprofondare nell'abisso. Oltre ai consueti ordini, è possibile interagire con Bullet coccolandolo, sgridandolo (se lo fate siete delle me*de) e premiandolo con degli snack per cani. Queste azioni, apparentemente estetiche, in realtà contribuiscono a incrementare il rapporto tra i due e a influenzare i molteplici finali del gioco, influenzati tra le altre cose anche dall'utilizzo del cellulare, che potremo usare, campo permettendo, per parlare con Jess, ex moglie di Ellis, tutto sommato ancora affezionata a lui e viceversa. Prima dell'inizio del gioco ci viene detto che ogni nostra azione è ""osservata"", ma non sapremo nell'immediato se una scelta appena compiuta (o non compiuta) si rivela giusta o sbagliata: lo sapremo solo proseguendo nell'avventura della durata complessiva di 5-6 ore, un tempo non certo longevo ma abbastanza esiguo da impedire di annoiarsi.

La presenza di Bullet, caratterizzato in modo molto curato e realistico, e il discreto numero di strumenti hanno lo scopo di creare una sorta di clima di sicurezza all'interno della lugubre foresta. Tuttavia la sensazione di mantenere il controllo è del tutto illusoria, e questo si paleserà soprattutto durante l'esplorazione: gli sviluppatori, infatti, ingannano costantemente gli occhi e la percezione di Ellis (e del giocatore) dandogli l'illusione di rivedere costantemente gli stessi posti, di girare in tondo, un trucchetto non certo originale ma perfettamente in linea con quanto si vede nei film della saga.
Una menzione speciale va data alla videocamera, probabilmente lo strumento più utile in dotazione. Sparse per gli ambienti di gioco si trovano delle cassette, grazie alle quali è possibile manipolare attivamente la realtà: per passare oltre una porta ostruita potrebbe essere dunque necessario fermare la registrazione in un frame specifico, lo stesso per far apparire dal nulla particolari oggetti. Ovviamente non mancheranno pericoli da affrontare (o evitare), ma lascio a voi il ""piacere"" della scoperta, dandovi un unico, vago consiglio: la luce li tiene lontani...

Il comparto audio, poi, è terrificante. Ovviamente in senso positivo. E' fortemente consigliato l'utilizzo delle cuffie, data la componente binaurale del sonoro, e così facendo il gioco vi tiene letteralmente in tensione dal primo all'ultimo minuto.

Per concludere, consiglio Blair Witch a un pubblico molteplice: i fan dei film, gli amanti dei giochi horror e chi ormai, come il sottoscritto, nutre piena fiducia nei confronti di Bloober Team, che ancora una volta dimostra il proprio talento sfornando un titolo intrigante, pregno di trovate orrorifiche già viste e sperimentate, certo, ma di pregevole fattura e intelligentemente contestualizzate all'interno dell'intera esperienza.

124977094,english,2022.10.05 12:25,❌,✅,0.4761904776,0,"I have questions for the people who left this game a positive review. For all the people that claim to have been really scared by this game and who claim this game is so good, did we play a different game? I'm not trying to be mean or rude, really, but this game was just not good in any particular sense of the word. And for the life of me I can't see how it has ""mostly positive"" reviews on here. Unless they are legit all for the dog. In which case you paid $30 to pet a virtual dog and that left you satisfied somehow.

This is gonna be long winded, so the tldr: Not scary, story was flat, too many mechanics for no reason.

Okay long version now. First this game lacks anything approaching horror. As someone who was legitimately scared of The Blair Witch Project, I went into this game expecting to be really frightened. And there were moments where the potential for a really scary game was evident. There could have been a really terrifying experience here. Instead you get half baked jumpscares, some shadow men that pop out at you every now and then, and a dark forest. I guess if you're really scared of the dark and/or the woods, then maybe this resonates with you a bit more. Or maybe if you don't normally play horror games this might be just scary enough to get you sweating. But as someone who regularly plays really scary games....this game was really weak in the scares. More often than not, even the jumpscares failed to make me flinch. Only once in the whole game did I legitimately not want to go down the dark scary path. It took me about 8 hours to complete. 1 decent scene in 8 hours isn't enough. The game could have much more effectively played on the fear of being ALONE in the woods. There could have been some really good atmosphere building. Instead you get to pet the dog every few seconds so you never really feel alone. I'll come back to that.

The story was hallmark movie grade bad. The main character isn't really relatable in any way, unless you happen to be a veteran of the Iraq War with severe PTSD. In which case my condolences. But aside from that...I don't care about Ellis. I'm not given a real reason to care. You are clearly supposed to give a damn about Ellis, his ex wife, the kid lost in the woods, the sheriff, etc but they don't actually bother to try and make you care. The biggest emotional moment is with the dog and frankly it doesn't feel earned. They're just using people's instinct to love animals to invoke an emotional response instead of building that feeling from the ground up. Frankly if the playtime devoted to emotional bs was redirected towards just building a scary game I would have been much happier. Also the dialogue and voice acting were lacking, further adding to the feeling of ""I just don't care"".

And finally, the mechanics, the actual gameplay. Here's the problem, there's too many mechanics. None of them are inherently bad or poorly implemented, but none of them are fleshed out or particularly interesting. The cellphone that you occasionally get to use to try and patch things up with your ex wife or receive creepy texts on, the radio you use sometimes to talk to a whole 2 people, the magic camcorder, the flashlight to kill shadow monsters, the backpack full of things, most of which get no explanation, the dog treats that are literally never even pointed out to you and thus you could miss them entirely, and of course the dog itself with the 5 different interactions, of which you mainly use ""pet"". There are so many different little bits and bobs and none of them actually amount to much if anything. You wanna get the best ending? Boy you better know ahead of time to call your ex incessantly. And how would you know that? No clue, game doesn't make that clear. Want to get the ""kill no enemies"" achievement? Well they don't explain that there's an alternative until it's far too late. Guess you better play it a second time then. You don't usually even know to use the dog to look for something unless the game specifically tells you to, because it's only really used a couple times. This game suffers from trying to have too many ""unique"" mechanics and as a result none of them are fleshed out properly or even really seem that useful. Ditch it all except the camcorder and the flashlight and now we have a decent game.

And yes, I am implying that the dog takes away from the game. Because it does. It's a cheap way to get you invested in one part of the game just so they can then get a cheap emotional reaction out of you later. It doesn't add to the experience. Feeling alone is a great way to make someone feel scared. You spend the bulk of the game with literal guard dog. So why would you feel scared? From a gameplay standpoint, the dog adds nothing. I'm sorry, but it's true. 

This game had potential. But the overly ambitious dev team didn't have what it takes to push it over the finish line. Nothing about this game was outright good. None of it was really bad either. It was bland. It's a really bland way to spend 8 hours and $30. Do yourself a favor and go watch someone else play it.

This is a game with a decision based ending, but you don't really get to decide anything and end up getting the worst ending no matter what. Because the game tricks you into doing all the bad decisions and those include the simple gaming stuff you do in every game like collecting stuff and beating enemies. So you shouldn't do those things, you shouldn't collect the collectibles and fight the enemies etc. to get the good ending at your first playthrough. Which is impossible since playing a game is almost always exploring the entire environment, collect everything and stand against your enemies. So it's bullshit. It doesn't make any sense. I really liked Layers of Fear. This isn't even close to it. In Layers of Fear your humanity really gets judged and you get the ending you deserve at your first playthrough. This isn't like that at all. 

Other than that, the game isn't really about Blair Witch at all but it's about the inner demons of an ex-cop and a vet who has a severe PTSD. It just sets in the woods and has this general ""witch in the woods"" theme. There's really no Blair Witch in the game. Which is another bullshit. It's like the developers used a popular culture element to get their game sell more. 

The gameplay has a lot of problems and it's not smooth like Layers of Fear. Also the atmosphere is not as good as it was in Observer and Layers of Fear as well. So if you liked those games and looking for another one, this isn't it. Don't waste your money on this.","SPOILERS

La Lore inventata è davvero ben fatta.
I rumori, le figure improvvise che appaiono nell'ambiente per un secondo e poi spariscono (che ti fanno credere a te giocatore di stare davvero impazzendo).
Il gameplay....Il gameplay è qualcosa di mai visto in un gioco!!!! 
Apparentemente uguale a molti altri, ma più si prosegue nella storia e nelle diverse ambientazioni e più ti sembra davvero ti impazzire, con oggetti che si modificano da soli nell'inventario, Jumpscare casuali e ben messi ed oggetti che sembrano avere un normale uso ma si riveleranno utili per altre cose paranormali <3

I like this game but failed to scare as much as I'd like it to. I understand it wanted to go into more of a Lore atmosphere but failed to scare. Each time the main character's past was brought up and you hear other people's voices I felt zero fear anymore.

To improve this game I would recommend the following: (SPOILERS) If more areas were introduced that involve bullet actively running away from you and the further away from him you are. The more terrifying things you see. The plot is good but drawn out too much as if very easy to see after 5 minutes into the witch house. The witch house is also too long and drawn out and over time loses any feeling of being scary. Dead silence and your footsteps do a lot to scare someone. The blair witch project movie had 0 jumpscares and never showed the witch. Having ambient sounds and footsteps drives someone to insane amounts of fear. I love the stare at corner scene at the end but you could have made it even better where the main character must find peter and anytime the witch enters a room you have to run to the corner with the symbol on it to avoid her killing you. You don't show her and in fact just have a silhouette on the camera and if you fail to go to a corner, from the darkness hands come and snap your neck maybe. Many fear causing and intense gameplay moments could have been done to make the whole game so much better. I would personally say to focus more on gameplay than the lore for the next game. Look to **witch hunt** for inspiration for a way more terrifying approach as the ambiance and curiosity make that game amazing. I wish bloober team the best and would love to see them fix things and make the game 10 time more scary.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2879372510
[b]Geschichte[/b]

Wir spielen einen ehem. Soldaten (glaube ich), der unter PTBS leidet. Als ein Kind im Wald verschwindet, fährt er dort hin, um sich an der Suche zu beteiligen. Da er die anderen nicht sieht, macht er sich, nur von seinem treuen Hund Bullet begleitet, allein auf die Suche.

Wir finden ab und an Hinweise, meist mit Hilfe des Hundes, die uns tiefer in den Wald führen, der von irgendwelchen bösen Mächten bevölkert zu sein scheint. Die Realität wird immer mehr von seltsamen Ereignissen überlagert.

Die Geschichte lehnt sich lose an den Horrorfilm von 1999, Blair Witch Project an, den ich nicht kenne. Aber m.E. ist dies eher egal, da es angeblich sehr lose ist und Freunde des Filmes wohl keine ""Verfilmung"" erwarten sollten.

Gefällt mir die Geschichte? Ich weiß nicht, soweit bin ich nicht gekommen, um es beurteilen zu können. Das Setting ist relativ typisch. Wald als Umgebung ist nachts angsteinflößend (man gehe mal selbst Nachts in einen fremden Wald).

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2879372626
[b]Gameplay[/b]

Ein ungewöhnliches Gameplayelement ist sicherlich der Hund an unserer Seite, der uns hilft, der aber auch ein paar Belobigungen gern hat, um nicht durchzudrehen. Aber am Durchdrehen sind auch wir selbst, also bleiben wir auch schön bei Bullet.

In der Praxis fand ich das Gameplay aber dermaßen anstrengend sich hinziehend. Wir laufen ständig den Wald ab, fragen Hundi, ob er eine Spur hat oder gehen der Nase lang. Wobei wir meist im Kreis laufen, was nicht ungewöhnlich ist, aber auch nervig. Nach was suchen wir? Keine Ahnung, irgendwas, was uns weiterbringt.

Wenn man genau dorthin und so geht, wie der Entwickler dies vermutet, dann stösst man sicher auf die entsprechenden Trigger, aber wehe, man verpasst etwas oder wollte sich nur mal kurz umschauen, da verläuft man sich und kann lange herumrätseln, was denn nun zu tun wäre.

Nachdem ich eine Spielpause gemacht habe, leicht gefrustet, musste ich den Abschnitt nochmal beginnen, weil die Checkpoints etwas spärlich gesetzt sind, und ja dann ging gar nichts voran. Ich konnte das Ding, das ich letztens noch fand, nicht mehr wiederfinden.

Also alles noch mal von ganz vorne. Ich kam etwas weiter, bis irgendwelche üblen Waldmächte mich attackierten. Was man zu tun hat, um dem zu entgehen? Keine Ahnung. Ich blieb schön brav bei Bullet, war dann aber doch tot. Und nochmal. Tot. Also echt, das Gameplay fand ich geradezu horrormäßig übel.

Mir fehlte eindeutig etwas mehr Klarheit einerseits beim Voirankommen in der Handlung als auch bei den Möglichkeiten, sich gegen die Wesen des Waldes zu wehren (oder wie man sie los wird).

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2879372112
[b]Technik[/b]

Ganz OK. Der Wald wirkt tatsächlich wie ein echter Wald. Interessant wie sie das gemacht haben mit den Wegen, die letztlich im Kreis verlaufen. Ich habe keine Ahnung, ob das echte Kreise waren oder ob da gut getrickst wurde.

Auch der Hund war Klasse. Selten einen so lebensecht animierten Hund gesehen.

Der Sound ist OK. Horrormäßig halt. Mit Surroundtechnik, so dass man einen Kopfhörer nutzen mag, um dies auszukosten. Die Dialoge (unser Held hat ab und an Funk-/Telefonkontakt) sind auf Englisch.

Die Steuerung mit Controller funktionierte gut.

[b]Sonstiges[/b]

Ich habe nach 3h aufgegeben, noch länger durch den Wald zu irren.

Es gibt viele Errungenschaften.

[code][b]In Zahlen für mich persönlich ein Unterhaltungswert von 4/10.[/b][/code]

Ein Horrospiel, das mich sehr frustriert hat durch zu unklares Gameplay.

Ich werde mit Schauder an das Spiel zurückdenken. Vielleicht hat es damit seinen Horroranspruch doch erfüllt?

I can be a bit of a completionist, so I might go on to finish the game, but I'm not having fun. Players are dropped into this game with little context on who Eli is, why he's looking for Peter in the woods, and why the cops got started without him. As we plod ponderously through a maze-like forest with faithful Bullet by our side and world's worst flashlight, we slowly learn more about Eli and what drives him. The problem is that neither Eli nor the ponderous plodding are very interesting, and Bullet can't carry this entire game on his back.

The reviewers calling this a walking sim are correct. You spend 90% of your time walking through the woods, sometimes backtracking, looking for clues and using video tapes to rewind time in specific areas to clear obstacles/find objects with only the ambiance to entertain you. The ambiance isn't bad, but once you realize enemies are sparse (and Bullet will warn you if they appear) the ambiance loses a lot of its bite. Feel free to sprint around the map, ignoring whispers and snapping twigs. Combat is more frustrating/boring than frightening (since when did the Witch have minions?), and the two enemies I've encountered so far are dealt with thusly:
- ents/tree monsters are killed once they are hit by the flashlight beam a few times, and Bullet will signal where they are (unless his AI gets confused and he just decides not to)
- leaf monsters are easily avoided by just not walking into them

My main gripe with the game and what might keep me from completing it despite the boring gameplay is the plot. Eli is a veteran with PTSD, on some sort of redemption mission (haven't learned all the details of that yet), and whenever the game wants to amp up the tension and spooks, it does so by yanking you out of the forest and into one of Eli's hallucinations about his time in some ambiguous Middle Eastern country. So the most intense, ""scariest"" parts of the game involve you LEAVING THE FOREST AND BEING FRIGHTENED OF SOMETHING UNRELATED TO THE BLAIR WITCH. This is bafflingly stupid. This is a game about the Blair Witch, not veteran PTSD awareness. I do not care about Eli's time in the military, I do not care about his squad, I do not care about his vague redemption agenda, sorry. And because the game focuses on that instead of the missing kids, I don't care about them either.

The sound design is good. The voice acting is fine. Bullet's charming but controlling him is jank. The graphics are mediocre. I've heard you can get a good or bad ending depending not only on your treatment of Bullet but on whether or not you destroy the witch's dreamcatchers or pick up her totems, which I can say the game definitely did NOT warn me not to do. Might not ever pick this up again, we'll see.","A little over three hours played at the time of writing this. I can be a bit of a completionist, so I might go on to finish the game, but I'm not having fun. Players are dropped into this game with little context on who Eli is, why he's looking for Peter in the woods, and why the cops got started without him. As we plod ponderously through a maze-like forest with faithful Bullet by our side and world's worst flashlight, we slowly learn more about Eli and what drives him. The problem is that neither Eli nor the ponderous plodding are very interesting, and Bullet can't carry this entire game on his back.

Em Blair Witch, você assume o papel de Ellis, um cara que resolve se embrenhar na floresta amaldiçoada do filme junto com seu pastor alemão em busca de um rapaz desaparecido. Claro que coisas sinistras começam a acontecer e, para piorar, Ellis também sofre de traumas que vão sendo revelados à medida que a trama se desenrola.

O problema de Blair Witch é a crise de identidade. Ele tenta ser adventure, walking simulator e survival horror, sem fazer nenhuma das coisas particularmente bem. A maioria dos puzzles é bem genérica, do tipo ""encontre/combine/use o item certo para consertar/destrancar/etc"". Algumas vezes, você encontrará fitas amaldiçoadas, devendo assisti-las e pausá-las no momento certo para alterar a realidade. Outras vezes, seu cão irá farejar um item, te levar ao próximo ponto, encontrar outro item, farejá-lo de novo, te levar ao ponto seguinte etc. Repita isso algumas vezes e perceberá que boa parte do jogo é quase um simulador de passeio de cachorro.

O jogo ainda tenta apimentar essa modorra com a presença de monstros que deverão ser combatidos a la Alan Wake, isto é, apontando a lanterna para destruí-los. Como eles são difíceis de enxergar, você deverá prestar atenção ao seu cachorro para localizá-los. Embora isso possa passar algum clima de tensão, o fato é que os combates parecem acontecer apenas em momentos pré-determinados, o que faz ficar perdido na floresta bem menos ameaçador do que seria se eles pudessem atacar a qualquer hora

Como se não bastasse, Blair Witch ainda trabalha com salvamento automático, forçando o jogador a aturar a aporrinhação até o próximo checkpoint sob pena de perder o progresso feito até então. A última vez que joguei, fiz uma boa exploração, coletei itens, entrei numa luta, venci, mas meu personagem bugou, ficando preso num dos objetos do cenário. Não conseguia sair do lugar, e descobri que o último save tinha sido uns 20 minutos antes. Desisti e desinstalei. Jogo chato e nada assustador. Vá dormir que é melhor.",

[u]Produkt w wersji pudełkowej[/u]

[b]PLUSY[/b]

-Podczas gry towarzyszy nam nasz kompan i mały pomocnik - jakim jest niemiecki owczarek! [spoiler] do czasu [/spoiler] Osobiście całej gry nie przeszłam, bo nie potrafię z niej czerpać przyjemności - ale do tego czasu co zauważyłam, nasza psina odwala kawał dobrej roboty. 
-Nasza główna postać - Ellis, ma dość sporo możliwości interakcji ze swoim czworonożnym przyjacielem. Od głaskania do komendy ""Szukaj"" która okazuje się bardzo przydatna. Psa również można skarcić czy nawet komendą kazać mu iść blisko nas.
-Można by rzec, że funkcja jaką pełni Bullet chyba zrobiła na mnie najlepsze wrażenie. Ale czy możemy teraz poświęcić podpunkt dla [u] Lasu [/u]? Obszar jaki twórcy gry stworzyli dla nas wydaje się ogromny. Nic bardziej mylnego. To ile chodziłam w kółko, mijając ten sam obiekt... Chyba spędziłam na tym połowę czasu w grze. Inaczej mówiąc, łatwo się tam zgubić. Sam las został zaprojektowany tak, że można zwiedzić i sprawdzić każdy krzaczek.
-Odniosłam się już do Bulleta i Lasu w tej grze, to teraz odniosę się do obu na raz. Bullet nie tylko pomaga nam znajdować kasety, szukać drogi w nowe części lasu czy uspokaja Ellisa gdy ten ma atak, ale również ma dobrą intuicję w terenie jak na psa przystało. Informuje nas o znajdującym się niedaleko niebezpieczeństwie, które czyha na nas gdzieś zza drzewem, na tereny mu nieznane a tym bardziej te które mają w sobie ""złą energię"" [spoiler]?[/spoiler] nie wchodzi do póki my sami się tam nie znajdziemy. Oczywiście wtedy psa należy wołać bądź przyjdzie za nami, ciężko mi to akurat stwierdzić. 

[b]MINUSY[/b]

-[strike]W moim przypadku[/strike] przejście z rozdziału do rozdziału bywało problematyczne i nie obeszło się bez poradnika na prawie każdym kroku
-Ubogie ustawienia sterowania. Gdy teraz wróciłam do gry po 3 latach, chciałam sobie przypomnieć gdzie w ogóle może być ta zasrama latarka czy pod jakim klawiszem woła się psa. Najprościej mogłam wciskać co popadnie, ale na moje nieszczęście wysłałabym pewnie plany na zbombardowanie Pentagonu do prezydenta USA...
-Możliwość skarcenia Bulleta [spoiler]tak, jestem psiarą[/spoiler]
-symulator chodzenia, to nie to co oczekuje od ""horrorów"" i to za taką cenę. Wersja pudełkowa wyszła mi przy kasie chyba 80zł
-totemy lalek które nic a nic nie dają, może achievement za zniszczenie danej ilości, ale do rozgrywki nic. wykorzystałabym te rzeczy w znacznie lepszy sposób. Lalki to typowy atrybut wiedźm, czarownic, więc przecież:Hej! Czemu tak to zmarnowaliście?
-fabuła mało zaskakująca

Jak wspomniałam, nie przeszłam tej gry do końca. Nie czuje takiego fun'u jak przy devour, the quarry czy outlast gdzie cały czas się coś działo. Nie czuje nawet ochoty aby na siłę przechodzić tą grę. Może kiedyś do niej wrócę, może nie i może będzie mi się tak kurzyć na półce. Osobiście mi się nie spodobała, ale ci którzy chcą ją kupić - poczekajcie na przecenę. O ile ta gra jakieś ma",

Se deja notar a la legua que es un juego de Bloober Team, y quien haya jugado a [i]Layers of Fear 2[/i] se habrá percatado. No es el mejor juego habido y por haber, pero tampoco decepciona. Su punto más fuerte es su notoria capacidad inmersiva y el bárbaro apartado artístico, no obstante, jugabilísticamente flaquea un poco más a mí parecer. 

Asimismo, desde mi punto de vista, cabe decir que los últimos títulos del género que ha sacado Bloober, parecen tender a sacrificar el terror o a relegarlo casi a algo secundario, priorizando la narración de la historia que tienen en mente, y [i]Blair Witch[/i] no es excepción. Dicho en una palabra: pese a que el juego cuenta con momentos de tensión y de terror, no son lo más abundante del juego, y con frecuencia estos son tan solo el telón del fondo para el [i]plot[/i] de la trama.

스산한 분위기와 무언가가 튀어나올거같은 '테러'를 잘 살리는 이 게임사의 작품에 걸맞게 어두컴컴한 분위기와 테러 요소는 레오피1,2를 뛰어넘을 만큼 굉장하다.

레오피1,2도 환각을 필두로 세운 그래픽이 환상적이였는데, 작중 건물 내부는 물론, 마녀가 산다는 울창한 숲의 그래픽을 환상적으로 잘 살렸다 생각함.

레오피1,2는 앞서 언급했듯 '환각'이라는 공포게임에서는 선구자격 요소를 도입하여 심리적공포를 형성했는데, 블레 어 위치에선 환각에 PTSD를 한 스푼 더해 더욱 몰입도와 공포도를 잘 올렸다 생각함. 레오피1,2은 무언가가 튀어나올거 같은 분위기인 테러 요소가 메인이 되었다면, 블레어 위치는 테러는 물론, 적이 갑툭튀하는 점프 스케어 요소 또한 있어 테러만으로 만족못하는 공게이머에게 좋다고 생각함.

스토리면에서는 엔딩후에 리마인드 시켜보니 처음부터 떡밥을 줄줄 흘리다시피 했으나, 엔딩이 조금 찝찝했고 너무 급하게 끝낸면이 없지않아 있음. 엔딩의 개수는 총 [spoiler] 3개 [/spoiler] 인거같고, 처음 플레이하면 높은 확률로 배드엔딩에 도달할 것 같음. 진엔딩의 조건이 너무 어렵다 생각.

Есть параллели с [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198962662877/recommended/418370/]Resident Evil 7[/url], Silent Hill Shattered Memories, сериалом «Ганнибал». Третий сезон Твин Пикса всплывал в памяти (жаль, что не первые два) при виде некоторых местных существ, и деревья напомнили карлика/руку. Такая вот солянка, наверняка здесь намешано еще много чего, чего я не знаю/не заметил. Вообще, убери название «Ведьма из Блэр», деревяные фигурки/висюльки и будет вполне самостоятельная история, так что не согласен, что это «прямое продолжение» фильма, как прочитал у кого-то. Но, собственно, ничего плохого в этом нет, что «не прямое продолжение», мне, честно говоря, трудно представить человека, который  хотя бы отдаленно внешне помнит героев первого фильма и интересуется, чем у них там это «продолжилось». В первой части и продолжать-то было нечего.

Атмосфера у игры местами достаточно неуютная, в паре мест смотрел прохождение так как было неприятно уже ходить по этому лесу. Мне больше по нраву чередование безопасности/враждебности. Самый неудачный отрезок игры, на мой взгляд, начинается ближе к концу, и он же, как я подмечал ранее, больше всего и напоминает первоисточник с большой долей Layers of Fear от тех же Bloober Team. Уж очень много бестолкового топтания на месте и сюра. (Хотя, был там и крайне интересный момент, где не нужно смотреть на ""ведьму"".) Причем сюр ради сюра, историю он не дополняет, атмосферности не добавляет, художественной ценности, как по мне, не несет, да и гемплей это бесконечное хождение из одного угла в другой только портит. А перед этим еще блуждание в тумане тоже утомляет. Да, еще у меня всю игру был какой-то баг (наверное), что когда выбираешь камеру, то изображение переходит в верхний левый угол. То есть картинка становится гораздо меньше. Ладно на ПК, но как в версию для Nintendo Switch с таким играть вообще не представляю. 

Круто сделали, что можно покопаться в предметах из инвентаря, например, похулиганить по телефону 🙂 или послушать разные радиостанции в машине и получить «приз». Таких бы моментов и деталей побольше, и игра, я считаю, была бы на порядок интереснее. Кстати, вот уверен, что с телефоном и рацией есть какие-то пасхалки/секреты. Визуально игра тоже понравилась большей частью, но, хотелось бы больше разнообразия, больше кусочков цивилизации, которые можно поизучать, один лес надоедает. Сюжет достаточно интересный, эти самые разговоры по телефону/рации добавляют деталей, делают его живее. Дальше небольшие спойлеры по сюжету: [spoiler]Правда, интерес к повествованию несколько убавляет затянутый финал. Уже все равно становится после этих бесконечных блужданий по дому. Но как по мне, не было там никакого антагониста и мистики вообще, просто сбрендивший мужик поехал на поиски. Хотя, может, и поисков не было никаких. В любом случае, ему бы в больницу обратиться, а не по лесам расхаживать. Да уж, бедная собака с такой компанией. Как и в фильме, не помню деталей конечно, но я бы предположил, что там всех «почикал» кто-то из местных а не потусторонние силы.[/spoiler]

Резюмируя, скажу, что это симулятор ходьбы, но качественный.  На мой вкус все же мрачновато и слишком однообразно, но вполне можно с удовольствием пройти разок, может, и несколько раз. Своих игроков Blair Witch точно найдет.

・恐怖度
”得体のしれない森を歩く”が7割、定期的に襲ってくる霊のようなものが3割。

サイコロジカルホラーゲームと銘打っているだけありヘッドホンで聞くとサウンドは良質で、ただただ夜の森を歩くというだけで色々なものを想像させられて臨場感満点でした。（わんこが可愛く心強いおかげで恐怖度が緩和されるので、ホラーが苦手な人でも大丈夫です）

霊については慣れると作業感覚になるので、ゲームが進むにつれて怖さは薄れていく感じです。

・物語
少年の失踪事件+主人公のトラウマ、さらに過去の戦時中エピソードまで加わり、やや分かりづらいです。ゲームを進めながら精神科医の手紙やポラロイド写真等の手がかりを入手し徐々に謎や期待が膨らみますが、クリア後に（バッドエンドだったのもあると思いますが）気持ちよく解消する訳ではなかったので、やや不完全燃焼でした。

特に最後の屋敷にたどり着いてからは、黙々と歩きながら回想映像を見るだけの作業ゲーになっているので長く感じました。

・システム
道中でビデオテープを回収し、再生を停止した箇所が現実に作用するシステムはユニークでした。使う場面に気づかずほかの手がかりを探して右往左往してしまった事もありますが、困ったらビデオテープを観返してみてください。

・総評
有名映画がモチーフというには物語に弱さを感じましたが、7時間というコンパクトなクリア時間とゲームの雰囲気は満足です。定価だと高い感じは否めないですが、ホラー好きでセール価格ならありだと思います。プレイ中はヘッドホンをお勧めします！",

Heureusement que tu es là, Bullet. On se sent très vite seul dans la forêt. Sans toi, je crois que je deviendrais fou. Je le suis peut-être déjà un peu, qui sait ? Mais quand je t'ai à mes côtés, j'ai l'impression que tout va bien.

Depuis que je me suis mis en tête de retrouver ce gamin disparu, je sais que je ne pouvais pas rêver trouver meilleur partenaire. On dit que les bergers allemands sont loyaux et fidèles à leur maître, et c'est vrai. Tu es toujours là quand la nuit tombe. Tu pleures quand le danger arrive, mais tu ne m'abandonnes jamais. On raconte qu'une sorcière vit dans la forêt de Black Hills, où elle aurait enlevé des dizaines d'enfants. C'est là que Peter, neuf ans, a été aperçu pour la dernière fois. Ces histoires de sorcellerie, c'est des conneries, mais je ne suis quand même pas très serein. Partout où je vais, il y a des totems étranges, des objets abandonnés, des photos d'enfants et des poupées en bois. Plus ça va, plus je me demande ce que je fous là. L'équipe de policiers en charge de l'enquête m'a dissuadé de venir, et mon ex-petite amie Jesse aussi. Je ne sais pas trop quoi faire d'autre, alors je continue. C'est comme si j'avais quelque chose à me prouver. J'ai beau m'enfoncer dans la forêt sans savoir où tout ça me mènera, tu restes auprès de moi. Et quand je me perds dans les marais embrumés, je n'ai qu'à écouter tes aboiements pour me repérer.

Je ne sais pas de quoi j'ai le plus peur, Bullet. La nuit j'entends des créatures rôder. Je reçois des messages menaçants sur mon téléphone, alors qu'il n'y a pas de réseau. J'ai retrouvé une caméra, même si je ne sais pas trop quoi en faire pour le moment. Tout à l'heure j'aurais juré entendre des voix. J'ai l'impression que nous ne sommes pas tout seuls ici, et plus j'avance, plus j'ai peur qu'on ne retrouve jamais cet enfant. Tu es ma constante dans ce monde incertain Bullet. Tu es toujours là quand je t'appelle, toujours partant pour une caresse. Je crois que je le sais, maintenant. Ce qui me fait le plus peur, c'est qu'il t'arrive quelque chose et que je me retrouve tout seul ici.",

トラウマを持った警官が相棒の愛犬と一緒に呪われた森に迷い込む。

森や廃墟のグラフィックと雰囲気は良く、一人称視点で不気味な森を探索するのは没入感がある。
前半はあまりホラー描写はなく、犬への命令とビデオを使った謎解き・収集要素が多め。
正直ホラー的には退屈なパートで、頼りになる犬と一緒に探索できるので怖さはあまりない。
犬を褒めたりおやつをあげたりできる。

後半は打って変わってホラー描写が増え、魔女の呪いにまつわるオカルト的な雰囲気に変わっていく。
ループ、視点移動を駆使したホラー演出は面白い。
ただ、主人公のトラウマの記憶がかなり丁寧に描写されるのだが、少しくどいような印象も受けた。
魔女の呪いについてはフワッとした感じの理解で終わる。

This is a VERY cinematic experience. The graphics look amazing and appropriate for the subject matter at hand. It's not a long play but the pacing is logical. 

Bullet The Wonder Dog really adds a new and worthwhile element to the game play. The trick I think lies in his various functions that you can have him do, on the one hand, but on the other, Bullet can become a liability if you get separated. A suggestion; Play the game as though Bullet is the real protagonist, or at least, your objective should be to keep bullet alive. Never chastise Bullet, feed him cookies at the end of dramatic events, pet him often and keep him close. You still get to be evil if you want, there's no reason to be nasty to Bullet.

At the time of this writing, many reviewers here on Steam have already said that the character you play as, Ellis, cannot ultimately be salvaged. It's true, and saying so ahead of time is NOT spoiling anything. As so many other reviews will also tell you, don't expect a happy ending. Ellis' gradual unraveling may proceed along several different paths, and may even result in more than one outcome, but just enjoy the ride. Ellis is a rather tragic figure, despite being a bit hackneyed, alas Ellis is a timely and relatable character. When we talk about the divorce rate, PTSD, the challenges faced by combat veterans, life in a post industrial society, all that. Ellis is a believable and sorta sympathetic character. Perhaps he's a bit dry and uninteresting. But I feel bad for him. You may find as you play this game that his tortures feel somehow familiar. 

The VVitch herself manifests as a sneering voice whispering at you from within your own skull. Her characterization really benefits from both a skilled voice actress and the game's use of binaural audio. She stops in early on to set you off on the dark path, and then she returns to ride you mercilessly for the final third of the game. Mainly, she appears as terrible endless mazes of memory. We come damn close to seeing her once, but not quite, for to actually see her means instant defeat. I found her attempts at a dark seduction rather soothing.  
My advice, don't resist the VVitch, embrace her voice, embrace the horror cliche. Blair Witch does not tread new ground as far as its story is concerned but I find it to be a worthy jaunt along a familiar, well worn and much beloved path.

The one thing that consistently annoyed me throughout and by far my greatest gripe with this game; the inventory system is terrible. Badly designed, cumbersome, slow and it totally trips up my finger work. There are enough action sequences where a degree of multitasking is required that this is sorta a major flaw. Points off. Some sequences are confusing and it's not always clear what we're being asked to do or how to pull off the task at hand. Such moments are not frequent, but they are annoying when they do occur. These are not minor issues, but they are the only two issues and there is no perfect game, so........pay full price, a lot of reviews here are saying that the game is not worth full price, but snag it at a discount when it goes on sale. That's really tacky and crass. The game is well worth the money for the right player, even if it isn't literally perfect. 

Another issue I see being discussed a lot is; who is this game for? Is it for horror fans? Is it for adventure survival fans? Is it an over the top walking simulator? It's all of the above. Don't play it if you aren't a fan of horror. Maybe by now we are all desensitized to jumpscares, but this game is compelling, even if it isn't terribly original. 

This game reminds me a lot of Amnesia: Rebirth. Much like the ghuuls in that game, the wood sprites are more of an occasional hindrance than a major challenge. Both Blair Witch and Amnesia: Rebirth are boldly demolishing the boundary between video games and movies through their broad scope, excellent pacing, quality story telling, wonderful effects and good voice acting. Interesting times to be a gamer and a horror fan. Blair Witch is a game for anyone who falls into either of those categories.","Do I highly recommend playing Blair Witch? Yes, I do.  I say ""play"" but Blair Witch is sort of an interactive movie. This is a VERY cinematic experience. The graphics look amazing and appropriate for the subject matter at hand. It's not a long play but the pacing is logical. 

Bullet The Wonder Dog really adds a new and worthwhile element to the game play. The trick I think lies in his various functions that you can have him do, on the one hand, but on the other, Bullet can become a liability if you get separated. A suggestion; Play the game as though Bullet is the real protagonist, or at least, your objective should be to keep bullet alive. Never chastise Bullet, feed him cookies at the end of dramatic events, pet him often and keep him close. You still get to be evil if you want, there's no reason to be nasty to Bullet.

At the time of this writing, many reviewers here on Steam have already said that the character you play as, Ellis, cannot ultimately be salvaged. It's true, and saying so ahead of time is NOT spoiling anything. As so many other reviews will also tell you, don't expect a happy ending. Ellis' gradual unraveling may proceed along several different paths, and may even result in more than one outcome, but just enjoy the ride. Ellis is a rather tragic figure, despite being a bit hackneyed, alas Ellis is a timely and relatable character. When we talk about the divorce rate, PTSD, the challenges faced by combat veterans, life in a post industrial society, all that. Ellis is a believable and sorta sympathetic character. Perhaps he's a bit dry and uninteresting. But I feel bad for him. You may find as you play this game that his tortures feel somehow familiar.

That or Blair Glitch, considering the amount of glitches many people seem to have with it.

You play as Ellis, an ex-solider/ex-cop, who, wanting to make peace with his demons, joins the search for a missing boy. Ellis rocks up late to the party though, so has to go into the infamous Burkittsville woods alone (and woefully under-prepared – all he has on his person is his wallet and dog treats lol).  Long story short, he and his trusty canine Bullet end up getting lost in those woods, and so begins five hours of strenuous walking in dimly lit circles. The atmosphere of the woods is great, but that’s about it. Because the game is 95% walking, I think the developers felt it necessary to include scenes of action to keep the audience engaged. So we get to do stuff like talk and play on our phone, on our walkie-talkie, watch some videos on a camcorder. These add to the atmosphere in a minimal way though, as their primary function is rather to add to the back-story, which is a mess, and frankly, bares no relevance to the actual story at hand. The woods turn into Iraq a few times as you battle through Ellis’ PTSD. It’s a very important issue that doesn’t get enough attention as it should, but it is one totally inappropriate and unnecessary for this game.  It breaks the immersion from the woods, which is the heart of the game (and the whole Blair Witch franchise), and where the horror is meant to be. Halfway through I was thinking ‘Maybe they’re being clever, and the horrors of the woods and the witch are actually products of Ellis’ PTSD etc’ but no. It was just some character-development add-on, and the story got much worse. The introduction of a secondary antagonist again took away much of the horror of the witch herself and relegated her to a vague but never-eventuating threat, and what we ended up with after hours of laborious meandering was really just some cliché trope made even more cringey by the bad voice acting/dialogue.

What it does do well though is that it rewrites the laws of time. For a five-hour game, it dragggggged on for what felt like ten (perhaps that’s why the price is so high – thank god I got in in a sale). The last act was simply ridiculous, and again, is why this game should be called Tony Blair Witch. It added nothing to the Blair Witch universe whatsoever. It felt totally unrelated to Blair Witch in fact. There was no impending horror of running into the witch, ever. There was no horror at all really. A few menacing shadows and satyrs growling at you from the darkness, but nothing to keep you up at night. All in all, this game was a huge missed opportunity. I think we should all leave the witch alone and stop trashing her woods with sub-par stuff like this, maybe then she’ll stop stealing and eating our children.","This game should be called Tony Blair Witch, because it’s more about war and PTSD than it is any creepy witch (for the young’uns who don’t know who Tony Blair is, he was British Prime Minister from 1997-2007, who, in his first six years in office, ordered British troops into combat five times, more than any other prime minister in British history.) 

That or Blair Glitch, considering the amount of glitches many people seem to have with it.

You play as Ellis, an ex-solider/ex-cop, who, wanting to make peace with his demons, joins the search for a missing boy. Ellis rocks up late to the party though, so has to go into the infamous Burkittsville woods alone (and woefully under-prepared – all he has on his person is his wallet and dog treats lol).  Long story short, he and his trusty canine Bullet end up getting lost in those woods, and so begins five hours of strenuous walking in dimly lit circles. The atmosphere of the woods is great, but that’s about it. Because the game is 95% walking, I think the developers felt it necessary to include scenes of action to keep the audience engaged.

A la recherche d'un jeune garçon perdu en pleine forêt, nous partons avec notre fidèle allié, notre chien Bullet, à sa recherche.

Sauf que ce n'est pas dans n'importe quelle forêt: nous nous trouvons dans celle de Black Hills, à la réputation maléfique depuis quelques siècles. On dit même que les Indiens du début du XVII ème siècle évitaient soigneusement de passer par ici, sous prétexte que Black Hills était source de malédiction.

Et la réputation de cet endroit va s'accentuer avec la terrible histoire d'Ellie Kedward, une jeune fille accusée de sorcellerie en 1785. Bannie du village, elle va se retrouver attachée à une charrette et abandonnée en pleine forêt, en plein hiver.
La légende dit que trois jours après, trois  garçons vont recevoir la tâche de vérifier si la prétendue sorcière est bien décédée. Et là, stupeur, ils constatent qu'Ellie est toujours vivante et décident de mettre fin à l'existence de cette pauvre malheureuse. Ils lâchent leurs chiens sur elle, frappent à coup de branches pointues et dès que son sang se mis à couler, ils la pendirent. La sorcière est bel et bien morte, cette fois-ci.

Et c'est à partir de cet instant que la réputation maléfique de la forêt de Black Hills va s'accentuer, car peu de temps après, ces trois garçons et les accusateurs d'Ellie vont disparaître soudainement, et ce, sans explication. Les villageois vont même fuir, un temps.

Depuis, cet endroit est le théâtre de malheureux événements reportés (des bruits étranges la nuit, des enfants disparus, des personnes perdues et qui auraient retrouvé leur chemin des jours après pour les plus chanceux,  des meurtres atroces sous fond de rituel satanique, parfois l'apparition d'une silhouette féminine... ). La légende dit aussi que la sorcière bénéficie d'un contrôle total de la forêt, et donc de la faune et de la flore.

C'est avec cette histoire en tête que nous nous aventurons dans ces bois maudits pour retrouver ce jeune garçon porté disparu. Cependant, les choses vont vite mal tournées et nous allons nous rendre compte que les Indiens avaient raison de fuir cet endroit malsain... Allons-nous retrouver cet enfant et sortir vivants de là ?


Le contexte et le but du jeu posés, je propose maintenant, sans trop de spoils (du moins je vais essayer) les éléments forts du jeu qui m'ont poussée à recommander fortement ce jeu:

- Le fait d'avoir un chien comme coéquipier est l'atout fort de ce jeu. Bullet est très attachant. Ce n'est pas pour rien qu'on dit que le chien est le meilleur ami de l'homme. Celui-ci nous aide à nous repérer (et oui, vous allez vite vous perdre, et vite avoir la sensation que vous êtes déjà passé par là, de tourner en rond), à trouver les indices également, à récupérer des objets vus mais impossible d'accès pour vous et surtout Bullet nous apporte une aide précieuse en combat.

- Pour les combats, c'est le même fonctionnement que le jeu Alan Wake, en gros votre arme, c'est votre lampe torche. 
Déjà que vous avez très très peu de visibilité, imaginez l'état d'angoisse où vous pouvez vous trouver quand il y a une ombre/ un monstre qui vous attaque. Et c'est là que le rôle de Bullet est primordial: c'est grâce à lui que vous allez savoir où se cachent ces ombres et donc où projeter votre lumière pour les éloigner. Bullet, fortement agité, vous préviens à coups d'aboiements et la position de l'ombre est indiquée par la direction où Bullet regarde. Le seul point négatif dans cette période de combat est la difficulté parfois d'illuminer l'ombre, puis de reposer son regard sur le chien car il est tellement agité qu'il tourne autour de vous. De plus, la musique bien intense et stressante accentue bien la sensation de danger.

- La possibilité d'interagir avec l'environnement en visualisant et en rembobinant les cassettes à un endroit précis est une idée originale, et renforce l'aspect surnaturel de cet endroit.

- Il y a un super travail sur l'esthétique de la forêt et niveau ambiance: c'est lourd, oppressant,  malsain, très peu de visibilité. Des bruits étranges, l'impression de faire toujours le même chemin et de revenir au même endroit de départ, des réceptions de messages d'un numéro inconnu sur votre téléphone alors que vous n'avez aucun réseau, la voix de la sorcière qui se moque parfois de vous ou vous donne des ordres... Tout est fait pour vous déstabiliser et vous procurer quelques bonnes frayeurs.

- Ce jeu a réussi à me rendre dans un état de stress pas possible et à m'en faire pleurer à un endroit précis du jeu ([spoiler] quand Bullet se blesse, qu'on le porte et qu'on tourne en rond, toujours le même endroit, avec écrit sur le mur et la voix nous disant: laisse le chien. Moi, laisser le chien ???? Va te faire voir la sorcière !"" [/spoiler]

Pour ma part, et ce avec tous les points énoncés ci-dessus, je ne peux que recommander ce jeu qui est pour moi une très belle réussite. J'ai vécu vraiment une expérience à part et dommage que je n'ai pas de VR, car j'imagine que les effets angoissants du jeu doivent être décuplés.

It's a case of the game in question having plenty of quality of great ideas, but not all of them are executed on the same level.

I do heavily appreciate the games attempt at representing mental health, PTSD and such. I think its important to discuss this topics and there's tons of artistic potential for such themes in the horror space.

I think Ellis, the main character is one which fits the Blair Witch universe very well and is prime bait for the witch herself. That being said, the game certainly doesn't have an even split in its focus.

It honestly feels like a spooky forest game for most of the time, with the witch only truly having a massive noticeable impact in the last few chapters. The ending does kinda explain that this was the whole point, but I couldn't help but feel like the story could've been spread more evenly.

That being said, game play wise I really liked the ending chapter and I think it caps off the game well. Although the actual plot ending itself isn't exactly stellar. Without spoiling anything, this game wants you to re-play it and try for different endings.

The issue here is that while the game is short, its a linear and heavily scripted experience that I doubt will lend itself well to numerous playthrough's, but keep in mind this is a surface level assessment.

When its all said and done, this is a decent horror game with many minor problems that stack up by the end.
I do hope more games come from the Blair Witch license, as there is a ton of potential here.
With a bit more creativity in game play design and a more balanced plot, this could've been horror GOTY material.

Still, its solid for what it is and I'd recommend it if you can get it on sale.

Besonders das Ende bescherte mir wunderschöne Kopfschmerzen, da die Lichtimpulse schon derbe auf die Augen gehen. Das Ende fand ich auch nicht sonderlich berauschend. Wobei ich schon sagen muss, dass man ein anderes Ende erwartet. Versteht mich nicht falsch, ich finde es gut wenn der Spieler überrascht wird, aber mein Ende fand ich irgendwie, doof. Man kann das Ende wohl beeinflussen und ein halbwegs ""gutes"" Ende erreichen, aber das werde ich wohl nicht erleben, da ich es kein zweites mal durchspielen werde. Daher bekommt dieses Game von mir lediglich 2 Kartoffeln.

[h1] СЮЖЕТ: [/h1]

Игра Blair Witch в жанре survival horror является прямым продолжением, то есть сиквелом, многим известного фильма ""Ведьма из Блэр"", действия которой происходят спустя два года после событий только что мной названой киноленты и разворачиваются в 1996 году. Маленький мальчик пропадает без вести в лесу Блэк Хиллз в городе Беркитсвиль, штат Мэриленд. Главный герой Эллис Линч, бывший полицейский с тяжёлым прошлым, подключается к поискам ребёнка. Обычное расследование быстро превращается в бесконечный кошмар, ведь герою приходится противостоять ведьме из Блэр — тёмной силе, поселившейся в лесу. Напрямую, понятное дело, ведьма в лесу не появится, но она успешно будет справляться с тем, чтобы мешать главному герою в поисках мальчика. Сюжет этой игры заинтересовал меня тем, что он, как уже было сказано ранее, является прямым продолжением событий фильма. И именно поэтому мне захотелось погрузиться в эту атмосферу снова, о чём я не жалею и не могу отзываться обо всём этом отрицательно.

[h1] ГЕЙМПЛЕЙ: [/h1]

Несмотря на свою однообразность, не надоедает. Похождения по лесу, когда приходится смотреть в оба, чтобы не стать жертвой нападения миньонов ведьмы, которые могут поджидать героя на каждом шагу, порой даже вызывает какое-то чувство дискомфорта, как и должно быть при прохождении игры в жанре хоррор.

[h1] ГРАФИКА И ДИЗАЙН УРОВНЕЙ: [/h1]

Даже на средних настройках оставляет неизгладимое впечатление. Прорисовка локаций, а также всего остального, в том числе и тех немногочисленных персонажей, каковых можно пересчитать на пальцах одной руки, на высшем уровне. Все те недостатки, которые есть у игры в графическом плане — просто-напросто блекнут по сравнению с тем, что в ней есть положительного.

[h1] ИТОГ: [/h1]

Данная игра определённо рекомендована моей скромной персоной к прохождению всем и каждому, кто размышляет над покупкой этой игры. Я не пожалел ни о потраченном времени на прохождение этой довольно-таки неплохой игры, ни о потраченных средствах на её приобретение. А это, как по мне, очень дорогого стоит. И мне бы хотелось, чтобы у этой игры было продолжение, но, как мне кажется, его не будет и мне нужно прекратить об этом мечтать.",

W ich dorobku jest już sporo tytułów, które zasługują na uwagę graczy lubiących ten gatunek, a Blair Witch to w moim wypadku powrót do czasów, gdy będąc szczylem oglądałem ten niby amatorsko nakręcony film przez studentów. Szczerze mówiąc tęskniłem za tym klimatem, więc ucieszyło mnie kiedy w sukurs wszystkim wygłodniałym klimatu tego klasyka przyszedł nasz rodzimy Bloober Team i tak oto od 2019 r. dane nam jest zagłębić się w legendę wiedźmy z Burkittsville jeszcze raz.

[h1]Ja i mój pies...[/h1]
W grze wcielamy się w Ellisa, który poza pełnieniem funkcji stróża prawa, jest też weteranem wojennym i ma to na tle gry niebagatelne znaczenie ( o czym za chwilę). Nasz bohater wraz ze swoim wiernym towarzyszem psem o imieniu Bullet, postanawiają dołączyć do poszukiwań niedawno zaginionego chłopca. Trafiamy więc na parking samochodowy przy lesie, gdzie odnajdujemy pierwszy trop i zagłębiamy się w mroczny las znany w okolicy pod nazwą Black Forest. Pierwsze etapy pozwalają pobawić się mechanikami oraz podziwiać jak nasz pupil szuka tropów po lesie. Jeszcze jest widno,  więc swoją drogą świetnie zrealizowany las, nie jest nazbyt straszny, ale do czasu. Im dalej w las, tym zaczyna być mroczniej i straszniej, a gra dawkuje strach bardzo rozsądnie lawirując na skraju naszych emocji. Z biegiem czasu się ściemnia, a my klucząc po lesie szukamy nowych wskazówek z latarką w ręku. Sporo osób właśnie w tym momencie odpada z rozgrywki, bo poza mrocznym i ciężkim klimatem, w lesie łatwo się zgubić ( pomimo niewidzialnych ścian), więc jeśli masz problem z odnajdywaniem drogi w lesie w rzeczywistości, to tutaj prawdopodobnie też będziesz miał problem. W moim wypadku problemem to nie było, bo wychowałem się w lesie, ale napotkałem za to na inny szkopuł. Mianowicie od pewnego momentu naszego bohatera nawiedzają wizje z przeszłości i tutaj twórcy moim zdaniem pojechali  czasami za bardzo. Przykładowo wielka polana z poruszającymi się liśćmi mnie nie przekonuje, a cały klimat poszedł w diabły i horror zamienił się odrobinę w komedię, podobnie wizje ""pola bitwy"". Na szczęście późniejsze fazy gry wróciły na właściwy trop i łącznie ze sławetnym domem, dawały odczuć psychozę strachu. (mówiąc w skrócie: wizje z przeszłości bohatera mnie nie ujęły za serce, ale reszta rozgrywki owszem:))

[h1]Mechanika strachu...[/h1]
Podczas rozgrywki w nasze ręce oddano kilka ciekawych mechanik. Na szczególną uwagę zasługuje oczywiście pies Bullet, z którym to podczas tych kilku godzin rozgrywki można się faktycznie zżyć. Nasz piesio poza szukaniem oczywistych tropów, potrafi też odnajdywać śmieci ( dosłownie śmieci i jest za to osiągnięcie:)), możemy go też głaskać i karmić smakołykami. Kolejną mechaniką jest kamera oraz związane z nią zagadki w cofanie czasu, a dodatkowo dzięki latarce w kamerze, rozświetlimy ciemność przed nami. Tutaj mała uwaga, mi kamera nie działała na początku i musiałem szukać pomocy na forach, ale dało się to łatwo naprawić i potem już wszystko działało bez zarzutów. Pytanie tylko, skoro problem jest znany, to czemu jeszcze nie został załatany?  Z innych oczywistych mechanik są znajdźki w postaci zapisków i innych przedmiotów powiązanych ze śledztwem. Jest też kilka ukrytych mechanik, a dodatkowo gra nie jeden raz puszcza oczko do osób znających oryginalny film ( kilka miejscówek, specyficzne drzewo, układ rąk na ścianie i wiele więcej). Wszystko to sprawia, że nie jest to zwykły symulator chodzenia i pomimo braku walki, jest co robić i gra się ciekawie.

[h1]PODSUMOWANIE:[/h1]
Nowa odsłona Blair Witch nie jest może horrorem wybitnym i ma swoje za uszami, a mimo to grało mi się w niego świetnie. Bardzo dobrze odwzorowany las nadaje rozgrywce specyficzny klimat znany z oryginału, a mądre mechaniki takie jak pies czy też kamera z noktowizją, fajnie urozmaicają rozgrywkę. Pomimo kilku dziwnych momentów  jak te ""kupki wędrujących liści"", gra pozwoliła mi poczuć ciarki na plecach. Polecam!

[b][u]PLUSY:[/u]
+ Klimat Black Forest
+ Pies Bullet
+ Ładna graficznie (zwłaszcza las:))
+ Potrafi wystraszyć też odgłosami

[u]MINUSY:[/u]
- Psychowizje bohatera to najsłabszy element gry
- Niedziałająca kamera
-  Bywa, że wyrywa z klimatu (sławetne ""kupki liści"")[/b]

[h1]OCENA:
8/10

[h1]BONUS:[/h1]
Blair Witch od Bloober Team, to nie pierwsza gra z tego uniwersum. Wszystko zaczęło się od sławnego filmu Blair Witch Project z 1999r. Kasetę z nagraniem podobno ktoś znalazł przypadkiem, a film był stylizowany na ""zwykłe"" nagranie studentów z wypadu za miasto. Pobudzało to wyobraźnię w tamtych latach, bo nie było jeszcze YT i innych portali z amatorskimi filmami ( zresztą nawet jak już jakieś były, to transfer w okolicach 128kb i tak nie pozwalał nic oglądać na bieżąco:)). Razem z kumplami po obejrzeniu tego hitu tamtych lat, odbyliśmy nie jedną dyskusję ile w tym prawdy itp. Było ciekawie, a las zyskał nowy wymiar (zwłaszcza na obozowiskach, gdy dla żartu robiło się z gałązek symbole znane z filmu i wieszało przy latrynach dziewczyn:)). Jakiś czas później wyszła gra o tytule [url=https://www.gry-online.pl/gry/blair-witch-volume-one-rustin-parr/z0a78][b]Blair Witch, część pierwsza: Rustin Parr[/b][/url] ( nawet ograłem, bo była dodawana do CDA jako pełniak ). Dzisiaj ten klasyk jest już średnio grywalny, bo grafika mocno się zestarzała, ale jak ktoś ma możliwość, to polecam ograć, bo w swoich czasach nieźle straszył.

Дивна гра. Тут панує страшна атмосфера в хорошому сенсі, але для мене практично відразу відкрився головний поворот сюжету. Тому сюжетно гра не сподобалася від слова - зовсім.
Але! Гра чудово передає атмосферу страху і напруження, і мене це захопило з перших хвилин. Blair Witch майстерно створює відчуття тривоги завдяки темним лісам, звукам і таємничій атмосфері.

[spoiler]
O jogo se passa entre o primeiro e segundo filme. A pegada é mais de suspense que de fato terror. Colocaram uns ""monstros"" sendo que em nenhum dos dois filmes é citado ou visto esses monstros (ponto negativo aqui). O fato de Carver ser um ""ser"" e não uma pessoa de fato faz com que o jogo se torne previsível e você saiba que no fim o personagem principal vai se tornar ele. Uma pena que seja um tanto difícil pegar todas as fitas para descobrir o que houve com o Peter (outro ponto negativo) afinal o jogo se baseia na busca por ele. O fato de parecer que Ellis e o Sheriff estão e ao mesmo tempo não estão na mesma linha temporal é bem interessante. A sonorização nos coloca dentro de uma floresta, por diversas vezes eu tive que realmente pausar pra lembrar que estava no meu quarto.

Plenty of unique gameplay aspects that kept puzzles and fetch quests more engaging.
It's story and execution is rather ambitious but in certain moments it tends to overstay its welcome, personally even if the idea is to make some levels/chapters feel like a loop/never ending, it could be more useful if in certains could get straight to the point faster since sometimes the feeling or impact a scene lands, lingers for too long.

There's a bit of choice making and hidden items for you to find as you make progress, these ones are rather unclear and can force a specific outcome without you realizing what you did.

This experience is unique and something you can do in one sitting and probably one of the most accurate experiences related to the Blair Witch Project","For starters, the game catches the essence of the Blair Witch franchise almost perfectly, the vast amount of land and forest that sometimes overwhelms you and you constantly need to explore, the detailed visuals and haunting scenery, shifting between day and night and with little tools to advance makes it a somewhat unique 'walking' simulator.

Plenty of unique gameplay aspects that kept puzzles and fetch quests more engaging.
It's story and execution is rather ambitious but in certain moments it tends to overstay its welcome, personally even if the idea is to make some levels/chapters feel like a loop/never ending, it could be more useful if in certains could get straight to the point faster since sometimes the feeling or impact a scene lands, lingers for too long.

There's a bit of choice making and hidden items for you to find as you make progress, these ones are rather unclear and can force a specific outcome without you realizing what you did.

In der heutigen Review nehme ich mir Blair Witch vor, ein Spiel welches ich mir damals einige Wochen nach dem Release gekauft, aber erst in diesem Jahr durchgespielt habe.

Bei Blair Witch handelt es sich um ein Horrorspiel aus der First Person Sicht, entwickelt von Bloober Team, den Machern von Meisterwerken wie Layers of Fear und Observer, welches einen tollen Start in den ersten Stunden hat, aber in der zweiten Hälfte in der Story nachlässt. Trotz der zweiten Hälfte und technischen Unstimmigkeiten mochte ich das Spiel aber irgendwie. Immerhin habe ich noch vor, es auf 100% Achievements zu vervollständigen.

[h1] [b] Die Story [/b] [/h1]
Blair Witch steckt uns in die Rolle von Ellis, einem ehemaligen Soldaten mit PTSD, welcher mit seinem treuen Schäferhund Bullet an der Suchaktion eines vermissten Jungen teilnimmt und sich dabei irgendwann mit seinen ganz eigenen Problemen auseinandersetzen muss.

Die Spur des vermissten Jungen führt in einen dichten Wald, in dem die namensgebende ""Blair Witch"" ihr Unwesen treibt. Der Weg führt immer weiter in den Wald, aber von dem Jungen gibt es weder eine wirklich hilfreiche Spur, noch ein Lebenszeichen. Die Suche beginnt, entwickelt sich jedoch im weiteren Verlauf zu einem Albtraum ohne ersichtlichen Ausweg. Werden es Ellis und Bullet schaffen, den Jungen zu finden und als Helden nach Hause zurückzukehren?

Blair Witch fängt mit einer wirklich guten Hälfte an, lässt aber im zweiten Teil in der Story nach, was das Spiel aus meiner Sicht runterzieht. Gerade die letzten Kapitel bis zum Ende hin kamen mir einfach richtig langgezogen und mit ganz viel Backpulver gestreckt vor, als würde man das Unvermeidliche immer mehr vor sich herschieben, anstatt den Schlussstrich zu ziehen, wenn es nötig ist. Macht das Spiel schlechter als es wirklich ist.

[h1] [b] Das Gameplay [/b] [/h1]
Blair Witch bietet teilweise sehr weitläufige Level, die durch den Einsatz der Unreal Engine 4 wirklich schick aussehen. In der Spielwelt selber kann man viele Collectibles finden, darunter auch einige, die zur Story beitragen.

Im Spiel lösen wir Rätsel, welche nicht allzu schwierig sind, dafür aber mit interessanten Mechaniken verknüpft sind. Die erste Spielmechanik ist (wer hätte es gedacht) der Hund, der uns während des Spiels begleitet. Bullet ist nicht nur unglaublich süß, sondern hilft uns auch beim Lösen von Rätseln und warnt uns vor kommenden Gefahren. Damit es ihm aber gut geht, braucht Bullet uns als Spieler. Er sollte immer in unserer Nähe sein und ab und zu mal gestreichelt und mit Snacks gefüttert werden. Und bei manchen Situtionen, in denen er uns helfen könnte, sollten wir ihn nicht nach vorne schicken, sondern einfach nichts tun und weitergehen.

Ich finde den Hund eine wirklich gute Sache im Spiel und würde mir wünschen, dass es mehr Horrorspiele mit einem Hund als Begleiter geben würde. Eine wirklich interessante Idee.

Die zweite Mechanik ist die der Videokassetten. Jedes gute Horrorspiel muss ja irgendwie einen Camcorder mit an Bord haben, daher besitzt Blair Witch ebenfalls einen. Das Interessante hierbei ist, dass wir mit dem Camcorder und verschiedenen Kassetten, die wir in der Spielwelt finden, durch spulen und pausieren die Ereignisse der Vergangenheit rückgängig machen und zu unserem Vorteil nutzen können, um vorwärts zu kommen. Das hat mich an die Mechanik aus Layers of Fear erinnert, in der man durch eine Tür in einen Raum gegangen ist, sich danach umgedreht hat und auf einmal war die Tür spurlos verschwunden.

Die Gegnerauswahl ist recht bescheiden und sobald man mal einen von ihnen gesehen hat, sind sie nicht mehr gruselig. Quasi wie beim Slenderman. Dazu sind die Gegner nicht wirklich herausfordernd, wobei der Fokus beim Gameplay also sehr auf der Atmosphäre und dem Lösen der Rätsel liegt.

[h1] [b] Grafik und Technik [/b] [/h1]
Blair Witch läuft wie oben schon einmal erwähnt auf der Unreal Engine 4, kommt aber mit einigen technischen Problemen daher. Die Grafik vom Spiel möchte ich gar nicht schlecht reden, die Wälder und vor allem die Lichteffekte sehen sehr gut aus. Aus meiner Sicht ein wirklich hübsches Spiel.

Allerdings habe ich schon Unreal Engine 4 Spiele gespielt, die besser aussahen und vor allem deutlich besser liefen. Blair Witch hat selbst auf einem halbwegs aktuellen Rechner an vielen Stellen Performance-Einbrüche, obwohl es keinen sichtbaren Grund dafür gibt. Ich spiele mit einem i7-8700K, 32GB DDR4-3200 RAM und einer RTX 3070 Ti und habe auf 1080p im Extremfall FPS-Einbrüche von 144 (locked) auf 60-70.

Wenn es mal nicht ruckelt, dann läuft das Spiel auf Ultra mit 120-144FPS im Schnitt. Und das ist ein wirklich guter Wert.

Warum ich das Spiel aber erst Jahre nach dem Release spielen konnte ist der Fakt, dass das Spiel (zumindest bei mir) so ziemlich jedes Mal beim Starten abgestürzt ist. Und zu dem Zeitpunkt war meine Hardware mehr als ausreichend für Blair Witch. Immerhin läuft jetzt alles ohne große Probleme, worüber ich sehr froh bin.

Was den Rest angeht, stört mich eigentlich nur die Tatsache, dass man die Steuerung der Tastatur nicht anpassen kann. Ich musste deswegen zum Controller greifen, da damit die Steuerung aus meiner Sicht wesentlich angenehmer ist. Was ist so schwer daran, eine frei anpassbare Tastenbelegung einzubauen, immerhin hat man es hier ja auch geschafft, einen FOV-Slider ins Spiel zu integrieren, worüber ich sehr dankbar bin.

Daher ein kleiner Tipp: Wenn ihr ein Spiel entwickelt, dann gebt dem Spieler doch bitte die Freiheit, die Steuerung nach eigenen Wünschen anzupassen. Jeder Mensch ist unterschiedlich, auch was die Tastaturbelegung in Videospielen angeht.  

[h1] [b] Fazit [/b] [/h1]
Am Ende ist Blair Witch kein perfektes Spiel, aber alles in allem ein Spiel, mit dem ich durchaus Spaß hatte. Klar ist die erste Hälfte deutlich besser als die zweite und dem Ende, aber das hat die wirklich gute Atmosphäre für mich wieder halbwegs ausgeglichen. Die Optik ist stimmig und die Soundkulisse sowie der Soundtrack großartig. Als wäre man direkt mittendrin statt nur dabei.

Dennoch empfehle ich euch Blair Witch nicht zum Vollpreis. Wartet lieber auf einen Sale, wenn ihr an dem Spiel interessiert seid. Aus meiner Sicht ist Blair Witch aber definitiv mal einen Blick wert.

Blair Witch bekommt von mir 7 von 10 möglichen Punkten.",

I think some of the creative decisions were cool and with some deeper looks into the mechanics of the game and collectables and whatnot, I think I could get more enjoyment out of this.

I also want to preface, I'm a horror fan. I enjoy horror games, movies, thrills, you name it. So my review might be a bit harsh.

Overall, the game isn't bad. It isn't the greatest. The story was lacking. I wasn't immediately drawn in. The character seemed rough. The ambiance was lacking. The horror was very lacking. I may have got one jump scare during the fog chapter and that was it. I felt like I was mostly running around trying to get through things because I wanted to just get the game completed.

The best part was the dog. And the ability to be able to use the cell phone when you had signal, that was a nice touch. Keeping in touch with people.

It was interesting, I will say that. It had elements of other EXCELLENT quality horror games. But, I think I just finished the game wondering WTF did I just play? I also will say, I've had friends with PTSD, from what they've described I'd say parts of Blair Witch hit it right on the head. All I can do from this point is weigh out the pros and cons and after I finish that list, I'll decide if this game is worth the buy. 

Pros:
* If you liked Layers of Fear 1 and 2, it's made by the same people. So you'll probably like Blair Witch as well.
* Had me on the edge of my computer chair. Many jump scares and just down right spooky and eerie things to see.
* Sound effects REALLY knocked it out of the park, walking around in the forest made you want to piss your pants at times. 
* Good graphics, no real issues, no studdering nothing like that
* Great story I THINK! I say that because, I really don't know what the heck was happening I was just along for the ride
* You have a dog companion who you can pet =)
* It's a psychological horror game, it will 100% screw with your mind. I have to say, I don't think I've played a game quite like this except maybe Layers of Fear 

Cons
* Frustrating at times because you simply don't know WTH is happening or where to go (that's probably the point but still frustrating)
* Towards the end of the game, the last chapter we will call it, goes on for FAR TOO LONG. I just wanted it to end after about 10 minutes of the same thing over and over again.
* When it does end, it leaves you with a big old ? mark floating in your brain. It was not a satisfying ending IMO 
* Getting your dog (Bullet) to find and fetch things is sort of a challenge. I'm not sure how it works, because sometimes he will find an item and other times he wouldn't. Yet, I'd find an item seconds later that I would have assumed Bullet would have found
* Being prompted to do things like check your cell phone, use your walkie talkie and use other items is cool, but sometimes you just don't know when or even why you should use said items
* I think the game is designed for multiple play throughs, but I don't think there's enough for me to want to go back and play it again especially because at times certain segments were too long
* Getting lost, that's sorta the first thing I mentioned on the cons list but I was being more general about the game. But now, I'm referring to as you are playing certain chapters you just have no real understanding as to where you are going. That's a pretty big turn off for me. Wondering around in a game like this isn't exactly that exciting. A couple of times, I had to use a walk-through to figure what to do next. I do not like doing that, but it was a last ditch effort. 

Well there's the pros and cons list, read it and decide for yourself, but because I don't think this game or the team deserves negative criticism I'm going to give Blair Witch a thumbs up. If you like these types of games, you will probably be on the border of good/bad just like I am. So why not give it a shot? Take my thumbs up!","Well, I just finished Blair Witch. I don't know.

Il s'agit donc évidemment d'un jeu d'horreur, par les développeurs de Layers of Fear, autre bijou de jeu horrifique, dont on retrouvera quelques mécaniques de jeu.
Une horreur qui, comme il se doit, s'installe petit à petit et dans laquelle on s'enfonce tout doucement. Tout commence dans les bois, où nous partons à la recherche d'un gamin disparu, accompagné de notre fidèle toutou Bullet. Je vous laisse découvrir la suite.
Une ambiance au top, très bonne sensation d'être paumé dans les bois, excellents effets (d'absence) de lumière, du tout bon ! Et pour les plus courageux, il y a même une version VR !
Ah oui un truc étonnant que je n'ai encore jamais vu, le jeu exploite l'éclairage de mon clavier !

I got the bad ending on my first playthrough but it didn’t make me hate the game or anything. I didn’t care much about the finale because the process leading to it was a complete blast.  I’m a fan of the original Blair Witch project film (1999) and I even liked the reboot (2016) although it is clearly inferior to its predecessor. What I find especially fascinating about this game is (obviously) the omnipresent atmosphere of the forest and the constant feel of something watching you through the pitch black of the night. Paranoia is a major thing during your first time in the game. Partly because you have no idea what is waiting for you in the woods.
But, without a doubt, the best thing in Blair Witch is your faithful companion Bullet. This dog was an MVP and I would have never finished the game without his helping paw. This canine genius always knows what’s up and where to go. It is also worth mentioning that it is impossible to fight monsters without him due to their supernatural ability to move at the speed of light. 
The plot is okay-ish. It is predictable in some ways, but still decent. The characters are all right as well, but, frankly speaking, I could not care less about Ellis, Peter and others. My main objective was to make sure that Bullet survived, others didn’t matter in that regard. 
What I did not like about the game is the pacing and replayability aspect. Do not get me wrong, the experience you get from your first journey is something that cannot be described with words but the game takes a sudden nosedive as soon as you play it the second time. During my second playthrough, I basically knew everything and thus the horror aspect along with uncertainty, tension and uncanny atmosphere of the forest were gone. The game is super scripted and monsters usually spawn at the same places. It is good for achievement hunting but bad for the replays. Also, the game is packed with various bugs and glitches. Petting Bullet is surprisingly dangerous – your camera can stuck in the unmovable animation. You can also get stuck between rocks or trees. Sometimes the ground beneath your feet can disappear, making you fall into the never ending abyss (Definitely witchcraft!) and many-many more.
Nevertheless, this game is like a perfect mixture of Outlast, Alan Wake and Firewatch (Outlast mainly because of the camera, AW has similar forest vibes). Solid 8/10, definitely worth a buy.

Paranoia is a major thing during your first time in the game. Partly because you have no idea what is waiting for you in the woods.
But, without a doubt, the best thing in Blair Witch is your faithful companion Bullet. This dog was an MVP and I would have never finished the game without his helping paw. This canine genius always knows what’s up and where to go. It is also worth mentioning that it is impossible to fight monsters without him due to their supernatural ability to move at the speed of light. 
The plot is okay-ish. It is predictable in some ways, but still decent. The characters are all right as well, but, frankly speaking, I could not care less about Ellis, Peter and others. My main objective was to make sure that Bullet survived, others didn’t matter in that regard. 
What I did not like about the game is the pacing and replayability aspect. Do not get me wrong, the experience you get from your first journey is something that cannot be described with words but the game takes a sudden nosedive as soon as you play it the second time. During my second playthrough, I basically knew everything and thus the horror aspect along with uncertainty, tension and uncanny atmosphere of the forest were gone. The game is super scripted and monsters usually spawn at the same places. It is good for achievement hunting but bad for the replays. Also, the game is packed with various bugs and glitches. Petting Bullet is surprisingly dangerous – your camera can stuck in the unmovable animation. You can also get stuck between rocks or trees. Sometimes the ground beneath your feet can disappear, making you fall into the never ending abyss (Definitely witchcraft!) and many-many more.
Nevertheless, this game is like a perfect mixture of Outlast, Alan Wake and Firewatch (Outlast mainly because of the camera, AW has similar forest vibes). Solid 8/10, definitely worth a buy.

Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone.  I know nothing of the Blair Witch franchise but I have played a large amount of horror games.  My main frustrations stemmed from the fact that getting lost in the game was a common occurrence.  The game allows you to stray from the main path to possibly add to the craziness of the forest and hide collectibles.  However, without Bullet I would have spent countless more hours being lost and frustrated.  The use of the camera and torch as a tool adds to the atmosphere and is a great homage to the iconic filming style of the movies.
I wish the game mechanics during the second half weren't so nit picky and stringent.  You lost any chance to enjoy the scenery that I am sure many employees spent tons of time on.  Plus dodging monsters became more luck based than actually following the rules the game provided you.  The check points in the fog were brutal and infuriating.  I can't begin to detail how long I spent during the final chapters in that horrid house being slaughtered over and over again even when I followed the white markers.  
The game has glitches that have never been worked out even 2 years after I played it when it first came out.  I had to constantly quit out of the game when I would pet Bullet and get stuck in a spinning animation that wouldn't let me move.  I understand some glitches when it first came out but these have gotten worse and hinders the overall game play that is specific to achievements.  
This game went from interesting and splattered with jump scares to a chore.  I played through this 3 times specifically for the achievements and will never play it ever again.
If you like the franchise and enjoy horror games, purchase at your own risk.  Otherwise, there are hundreds of other horror/thriller games that are much better.","My favorite aspects of this game were the dog Bullet because I wouldn't have been able to complete this game without him and the fact that the game can and should be played multiple times.

I'm a huge fan of the original film (not the 2016 reboot), and there's something special about traveling through the woods in the pitch black night. Like the film, the forest feels like a giant, terrible abyss, and the atmosphere is usually very effective. IMO, the best horror games are about atmosphere, not silly jumpscares, and Blair Witch mostly pulls this off well.

Having a dog as your companion was a brilliant move by the developers. Bullet acts as an emotional anchor, and when he's in danger, you really feel invested. It's also useful that you're usually able to follow him through forest environments that would otherwise be difficult to navigate (especially when there's no clear path). Nevertheless, I still found myself getting lost or going in circles more than once. At first, it added to the game's atmospheric dread, but eventually it got frustrating.

This is more of an interactive linear experience and less of a ""game."" Drawing inspiration from Silent Hill and Outlast and marrying them with the Blair Witch lore, I think it mostly works well. Another reviewer mentioned that the first two-thirds of the game are good, but things fall apart during the last third, and I agree. The final third of the game is a seemingly endless loop that drags on and on and on and on. The game already suffered from pacing issues, and the final third of the game is definitely the worst in this regard. The developers don't seem to realize that timing is a big part of effective horror; the longer you stay in a ""scary"" place, going through room after room after room, the less scary it becomes. We get the story about Ellis's past, we didn't need to see it dragged out like this.

That said, I think it's a worthwhile enough experience that I'll be playing a second time.

Bem, quase isso mas no fundo, a realidade é outra.

 Blair Witch tenta evocar o sensacionalismo do pseudocumentário de 1999 em uma sequência desafiadora, após suas duas adaptações Book of Shadows de 2000 e The Woods de 2016 serem o ritmo de dose baixa e desenfreada que seu primeiro percurso tentou passar. 

Sejamos francos: a primeira versão é um manto ritualistíco do genero pseudo e como sabemos o efeito hollywoodyano tenta sempre cuspir no mesmo prato com semelhanças abruptas e desparelhas de remakes mal projetados apenas por um mero din din da sorte a calhar para os mercenautas da modernidade. Temos colunas de se admirar na sétima arte nos dias de hoje, mas são quase dificeis de se notar e muitas vezes necessitam o olhar perdido de apenas uma paisagem de se admirar. 

E eis que retornamos a este game, que trocou as rédeas e todo o percurso da carroça para algo notável de se expor. Após ter jogado Layers of Fear e Observer da desenvolvedora Bloober Team, posso dizer que este tomou recusas de ser uma adaptação merecedora. Um dos temas que me agradou foi a ideia de ter um Mad Max Doggo para te acomponhar e te auxiliar na jornada. Todo momento voce deve se preocupar com ele e isso podendo afetar o desenrolar do desfecho. Apesar de reprimir no final dos créditos como um projeto amador pela paixão inescusavel do filme, deveria ter sido melhor temperado como seus games anteriores, se tornando uma trilha de migalhas de joão e maria para uma tenebrosa Haunted House of Hill P.T version Without Vincent Price.",

Projekt opracowało polskie studio Bloober Team, mające na koncie takie projekty jak Observer, czy serię Layers of Fear oraz od niedawna także The Medium.
Historia zaczyna się od tajemniczego zaginięcia pewnego chłopca w lesie Black Hills nieopodal Burkittsville w stanie Maryland w USA w 1996r.
Gracz wciela się byłego glinę - Ellisa z niełatwą przeszłością, który dołącza do poszukiwań dziecka mimo zakazów ze strony przełożonych. Chcąc odnaleźć chłopca, bohater musi zmierzyć się nie tylko z własnymi lękami, ale również wiedźmą z Blair, która według legend nawiedza las Black Hills. Pomoże mu w tym wierny przyjaciel - pies Bullet.
W ""Blair Witch"" akcję obserwujemy z perspektywy pierwszoosobowej, a rozgrywka koncentruje się na eksploracji i odkrywaniu fabuły. Podczas zabawy wraz z Bulletem przeczesujemy ponury las, gdzie czas oraz przestrzeń ulegają zniekształceniu i zakrzywieniu. Zabawę urozmaicają okazjonalne zagadki, które rozwiązujemy za pomocą manipulacji czasem i przestrzenią dzięki kamerze. Co pewien czas pojawiają się również wyzwania zręcznościowe, takie jak sekwencje ucieczki. Istotną rolę w rozgrywce odgrywa pies. Można mu wydawać proste komendy, ale często reaguje on również samodzielnie, np. informując nas o ważnych rzeczach. Grę opracowano w taki sposób, że podczas jednorazowego przejścia nie doświadczymy wszystkiego co produkcja ma do zaoferowania, gdyż gra przewiduje 4 możliwe zakończenia, a żeby je poznać należy przejść grę kilkukrotnie. 
Na plus jest też zdecydowanie grafika. Jest bardzo dobra, przyjemna dla oka. Eksploruje się z zaciekawieniem podziwiając otoczenie, które też odgrywa ważną rolę w fabule. Twórcy stworzyli w pełni trójwymiarowe lokacje.
Dźwięk także jest niczego sobie. Dodaje klimatu, dając poczucie zaszczucia, ciągłego zagrożenia i niepewności. 
Chociaż najbardziej i tak jest ciekawa mechanika współpracy z psem.
Grę można znaleźć na przecenach już za 30zł, ale nawet za 50zł opłaca się ograć. Nie mam żadnych zastrzeżeń, ponieważ optymalizacja też jest dobrze zrobiona. Nie ma żadnych spadków, a gra utrzymuje stałe 60 klatek.
Biorąc pod uwagę też to, że gierka ma 4 zakończenia na kilka godzin każda(chyba że znając grę leci się na speedrunie), co daje więcej czasu zabawy to oceniam ją z czystym sumieniem 10/10 :)",

El juego esta bueno, tiene mecánicas interesantes. La historia no es la mejor, pero tampoco esta tan mal.
pero el punto mas flaco de este juego es el final (cualquiera de los 4). 
Tener que pasarse el juego 4 veces para en el final tener una cinemática distinta no esta bueno. Los finales no tienen acción, son simplemente cinemáticas. El juego tampoco esta como para reejugarlo tantas veces. Si bien debes realizar algunas cosas de distinta manera para acceder a los finales, el juego es el mismo.
En cuanto al ""terror"", el juego no es la gran cosa, pero tampoco es monótono. Tiene algunos jump scare que te van a sacar unos sustos.

WOW, The “Blair Witch” forest is a really really scary place to be, and even more scarier when the sun goes down.  You play a man with PTSD, together with his dog (so you’re not alone) who all get lost in the forest where things just start getting out of control. The mind plays tricks and it messes you up as the player. Best part was the scary forest, the road down into total madness and desolation, the evil one cannot see and the destruction of self. Only down side is low FPS on high end PCs and bad porting. Besides that it’s a 10/10 and makes the Blair Witch movies a fun Sunday afternoon walk compared to this mother of a nightmare of a game.

Я смотрел только первую часть, и не знаю, что происходило во франшизе после, но когда в игре по фильму, который весь строился на страхе неизвестного, через полчаса надо как в Алане Уэйке выжигать фонариком деревянных Слэндерменов… Мне кажется, суть была немного упущена. Главный герой - бывший солдат в зеленой куртке с ПТСР и проблемами в отношениях. Бинго! 

В лесу очень атмосферно, но геймплей опять сводится к «дойди до триггера, посмотри галлюцинацию, иди к следующему». Я понимаю, что весь оригинальный фильм герои просто не могли дорогу найти, и это такая себе основа для игры, но может тогда не стоило вообще все это делать?
Рекламная кампания завлекала собакой-напарником, но это максимально искусственная фишка. Какое-то сочетание костыля и шор, чтоб игра больше отличалась от прошлых проектов, плюс в конце был бы Моральный Выбор. Почти как у Блейка Снайдера, но вместо котика тут «Спасите песика». 

С саунд-дизайном здесь что-то странное. Хруст веток и прочие шорохи звучат великолепно, но потом ты с кем-то говоришь по телефону/рации и не можешь разобрать ни слова, потому что речь заглушает жуткий эмбиент.

Fakat oynadıkça olayın bu kadar basit olmadığını aslında eskiye dayalı daha büyük travmalar sahibi olduğumuzu anlıyoruz.
Oynanış belirli objeleri bulmaya dayalı. Özellikle kasetler... Kırmızı kasetler yardımıyla bazı şeyleri açığa çıkarabilir, görebilir ve hatta yoldan kaldırabilirsiniz. Mavi kasetler ise sadece izlenebilir. Etrafta size faydası olmasa da sizi ürkütecek nesnelere de yer verilmiş. 
Bu kafa karışıklıklarının yanı sıra bizi hayata döndüren köpeğimiz Bullet'tan da söz edeyim. Bullet, pek çok konuda bize yardımcı oluyor. Etraftaki objeleri bulabiliyor, yol gösterebiliyor, tehlike yaklaşmadan önce uyarabiliyor. Bundan dolayı Bullet'ı kendinize yakın tutmakta fayda var. 

Korku filmlerine, oyunlarına ve kitaplarına çocukluğumdan beri tutkuyla bağlıyım. Öyle ki bir zamandan sonra artık ""bana jumpscare bile işlemez!"" dediğimiz o çizgiyi geçtim. Bu oyun bana ortamı çok güzel yaşattı. Kulaklığımın teki çalışsa belki daha da etkileyebilirdi. Sesleri, ortamı, görevleri, hatta oradan oraya sürüklenirken girilen döngüleri.... hepsi enfes. Özellikle en çok beğendiğim detay sanırım. Döngüleri hikayede çok güzel işlemişler. Bir sanat ortaya konmuş. Karakterin o anlardaki gerginliğini falan öv öv bitmez. Atmosferi övmeye kalksam 18 ay sürer. Daha fazla ekran görüntüsü almak isterdim fakat sağı solu kontrol etmekten çok da fırsat bulamadım :""D

Ormanda yaşanan şeylerden daha çok Ellis olarak yaşadığım şeyleri düşündüm. Birkaç final tahminim de vardı. Kafamdaki gibi klişe bi final olmadığı için mutluyum fakat açıkçası daha iyi şekilde ilerletilip, bitirilebilirdi. Final benim için hayal kırıklığı oldu. Yine de güzel bir deneyimdi. Emeği geçenlere de kucak dolusu teşekkürler. Filmini gölgede bıraktı benim için. 8/10",

Being lost in a creepy forest and the subtle witch myst that left you in the dark whether the witch was real or ""only in your head"". It's mostly a walking simulator with very few *cough* ""action"" moments, and that's exactly what I wanted from it.

Blair Witch had a nice start. We join the search of a missing boy and eventually get lost in the deep forest all alone with our loyal (and cute!) dog. The more we walk on, the more we are facing visions of horror. The gorgeous forest becomes darker and creepier and at some point we're wondering: what's real? What's just in our head?

It's an intersting trip for the most part. However, most everything that I liked about Blair Witch poofed in the last part. To make it worse, the last part even felt endlessly stretched and tedious. Partially even so annoying that I just wanted the game to end. 

And the ending was bad. Like, real bad. Okay, my Doggy survived, that's the only good thing about it. Like in Layers of Fear 2, Bloober Team didn't give you any hints on what to do in order to achive the more-or-less good ending. Playing by instinct will most probably reward your 6 hours playtime with the bad ending. And Blair Witch - at least for me - is not the type of game to replay over and over to see which playstyle leads to what ending. 

All in all, Blair Witch to me was a bit better than neutral.

The graphics are excellent, but a 2070S isn't enough to handle full 4K without 50% resolution scaling or other significant compromises. But it's the most convincing woodlands I've seen.

Great voice actors, great immersion, so-so story, and one exceptionally terrifying environment that's too scary to explore. I haven't felt this way in a long time.

The graphics are excellent, but a 2070S isn't enough to handle full 4K without 50% resolution scaling or other significant compromises. But it's the most convincing woodlands I've seen. While it still has some mildly annoying aspects that give away its Indie status, it doesn't get much better than this for indie horror games with AAA graphics. Great voice actors, great immersion, so-so story, and one exceptionally terrifying environment that's too scary to explore. I haven't felt this way in a long time.

Blair Witch! Ahh, que grata surpresa meus amigos!!! Este game me proporcionou uma das melhores experiências em jogos no geral; quem dirá no próprio gênero de terror. 

Do começo ao fim este game me fez sentir como se estivesse sendo arrastado para o inferno aos poucos; causando tensão, pavor e uma ansiedade fodid* (E o ápice dessas emoções se deu no final) mérito principal a sonoplastia e demais recursos audiovisuais que este game implementou com maestria.

[h1]Ah, é meio óbvio mas vale salientar![/h1]

Se você é fã deste tipo de game, provavelmente já sabe que a gameplay será melhor experienciada em um ambiente escuro e com fones de ouvido. Sussurros amedrontadores, galhos secos quebrando, o canto dos corvos na floresta que popularmente é interpretado como um sinal de mau presságio, morte e azar; além da melodia pavorosa e a respiração ofegante: cada barulho serviu minuciosamente para me deixar totalmente imerso no domínio amaldiçoado da bruxa na floresta.

Também gostei da reverência baseada no enredo original do filme de 1999, não alterando absolutamente nada dos acontecimentos da franquia, mantendo-se respeitosa com as premissas principais, como por exemplo: O fato da Bruxa em si existir apenas na imaginação como uma representação do mau e não uma figura explicitamente caracterizada.

Em suma; recomendo 100%",

Нельзя сказать что игра блещет сюжетными ходами, но чувство  тревоги и бесконечного одиночества заблудившегося в темноте леса передана просто бесподобно. Страшным ужастик я бы не назвал, да и мистики в ней почти нет. Игра про человека со своеобразным въетнамским синдромом, который попадает в среду где его безумие начинает быстро прогрессировать. И все это на фоне шумящего темного глухого леса, где луч фонарика вырывает силуэты, очертания коряг и растительности, которые рождают в его голове жуткие образы. А когда видишь тот самый дом из фильма ""Ведьма из Блэр"" да под эту всю атмосферу, то восторга просто нет конца. Но игра не про ведьму как ни странно. Игра про то как попасть в голову безумца и пройти с ним вместе это ужасный путь потери реальности и полного тупика одиночки посреди бесконечного темного леса. Именно это, а не внезапные ""бу"" делают игру в своем роде уникальной. Правда с концовской все же перегнули - слишком затянутая. Но тем не менее подобным именно глубоким погружением не многие игры могут похвастаться, хоть тема безумия то и дело мелькает то тут то там. А вот именно под этим углом пожалуй если только The Beast Inside, да и то в немного другом аспекте. По своей основной динамике это бродилка, поэтому ждать стремительного экшена, за исключением отдельных моментов, тут не стоит. Но это не делает игру хуже. И при этом думать что это просто легкая прогулочка тоже не стоит, хотя игра, будем честны, предельно линейна что в данном варианте совсем не недостаток. В любом случае продукт получился весьма занимательный. Графика отличная, атмосфера мрачная и завораживающая, эффекты и звуковое сопровождение прекрасны. Особенно последнее. В этой игре вы не будете бояться монстров (они только в голове главного героя), но будете реально напряжены хрустом веточек под ногами, завываниями ветра в кронах высохших сосен, шумом ветра в листве и прочими атрибутами глухого леса. Порой даже слышен треск изгибающихся деревьев. Работа на звуком - мое почтение. Лес в игре отдельное произведение искусства. Считаю что игру стоит попробовать уже по этой причине, не говоря уже об остальных. Ну а так для не посвященных в игре 4 концовки. В итоге имеем следующее: 7 из 10.",

Игра примерно до середины держит игрока в мыслях о легендарной ведьме по которой был снят типо документальный фильм Ведьма из Блер. Но в последвии немного расстроило что это не совсем так. 

Впечатления, конечно не испортились ведь я получил мистику и ужасы леса, которые мне хотелось там увидеть. Игра получилась действительно страшной и пугающей особенно, когда играешь один. Радует реализация механика с камерой, которая показывает то что не видно обычным человеческим зрением. Ещё самый важный отрубит это компаньон, который не даёт окончательно окоченеть от страха. В самом геймплее собачка помогает находит путь и подбадривает, что нужно в конкретной ситуации в которой игрок находится вместе с главным героем.

Film ""Blair Witch Project"" kocham miłością niezachwianą, odkąd zobaczyłem go po raz pierwszy, a więc od kilkunastu lat. Od niego zaczęło się zresztą moje uwielbienie do horrorów found footage, do których mam ogromną słabość. Można więc powiedzieć, że znacząco wpłynął na moje życie. Przede wszystkim pokazał podstawową prawdę o ludzkiej naturze, o której mówił już sam H.P. Lovecraft: że najsilniejszym rodzajem strachu jest strach przed nieznanym, niedopowiedzianym, tym, czego nie widać i co musimy sami sobie wyobrażać. Słowem: nie przed tym, co rzeczywiste, a przed tym, co rodzi się w naszej głowie. 

W 2019 roku polskie studio Bloober Team wypuściło grę ""Blair Witch"" na bazie licencji rzeczonej franczyzy. Jeżeli przejrzycie jej recenzje, zobaczycie, że są mieszane i generalnie na tę produkcję sporo się narzeka. Że za nudna, że za krótka, za droga, że niektóre sekwencje bywają frustrujące i zapętlone na jedno kopyto. Z drugiej strony chwali się dopracowaną warstwę wizualną i niesamowity klimat lasu Black Hills. Jako osoba, która niedawno ukończyła rozgrywkę i właśnie ją trawi, mogę powiedzieć jedno: rozumiem jedne i drugie opinie. Niemniej moja własna, na bazie mojej wrażliwości, wiedzy na temat opowiadania historii, a także... reakcji mojego organizmu na to, czego doświadczyłem, jest następująca: ""Blair Witch"" stworzone przez naszych rodaków, Polaków jest CHOLERNYM ARCYDZIEŁEM! 

W grze pierwszoosobowej (ważny szczegół, bo nie widzimy postaci głównego bohatera i patrzymy na świat jego oczami) wcielamy się w byłego policjanta i weterana wojennego - Ellisa - który wraz ze swoim psem zapuszcza się do lasu Black Hills, aby pomóc w poszukiwaniach zaginionego chłopca. Jak nietrudno się domyślić, w związku z tym czekają go liczne paranormalne przygody. Tym bardziej przerażające dla niego, bo będzie musiał zmierzyć się nie tylko z wiedźmą z Blair, ale również z własnymi demonami przeszłości. 

W tym miejscu warto się zatrzymać i zwrócić uwagę na jedną podstawową kwestię, od której zrozumienia zależy pozytywny odbiór tej gry: jest to przede wszystkim historia psychologiczna, nie survival/action horror w stylu Alana Wake'a czy Resident Evil. Nie wiem, czy zdajecie sobie sprawę, ale chyba nie ma trudniejszego gatunku do tworzenia w medium bazującym przede wszystkim na obrazach, takim jak film albo właśnie gra komputerowa. W historii psychologicznej liczą się bowiem przeżycia wewnętrzne, które wprawni aktorzy co prawda z grubsza są w stanie oddać swoją mimiką i językiem ciała, ale to wciąż nie przekazuje tego samego co słowa narratora, które wprost opisują, co dzieje się w głowie bohatera. Dlatego właśnie historie psychologiczne najłatwiej jest po prostu pisać jako powieści. Niestety, ze względu na swoje niespieszne tempo i fragmenty wnikania w przemyślenia postaci, w których siłą rzeczy nie ma za wiele akcji, często mogą być postrzegane jako nudne. A ponieważ dzisiaj ludzie są narkomanami doznań, które mają zapewniać przede wszystkim skoki adrenaliny, coraz trudniej nas w tej kwestii zadowolić.  

Zaryzykuję stwierdzenie, że aby w pełni docenić ""Blair Witch"" odbiorca musi mieć określony typ osobowości i wrażliwości na specyficzne bodźce. Najlepiej, aby był introwertykiem i wczuł się w rozterki głównego bohatera, w jego tragiczną historię, poczucie winy i wciąż niezaleczone rany. Musi umieć zachwycić się przepięknie, wręcz artystycznie stworzonym lasem, który wprost rozwala klimatem. Wtedy będzie cieszył się samym faktem, że może na niego patrzeć i słuchać jego dźwięków, dopełnionych nastrojową muzyką. A przede wszystkim - musi zmienić sposób myślenia odnośnie do gry komputerowej i postrzegać ją nie jako dzieło, w którym musi przede wszystkim się dziać (a takiego rodzaju gier jest najwięcej), tylko takie, w którym najważniejsza jest interaktywna historia, w której bierzemy udział jako główny bohater, natomiast jej elementy typowo ""gamingowe"" są jedynie dodatkiem i niekiedy można wręcz postrzegać je jako zbędne! 
No bo owszem - są momenty, w których za pomocą latarki walczymy z potworami przemykającymi między drzewami, ale sporadyczne. Owszem - są momenty, w których aby ruszyć dalej, musimy rozwiązać zagadkę, znaleźć brakujący fragment jakiegoś urządzenia albo wykonać określone czynności, ale nie są szczególne wymagające. Są znajdźki takie jak drewniane figurki, zdjęcia dotychczasowych ofiar mordercy czy charakterystyczne totemy z gałęzi drzew. Zapaleni gracze mogą być tymi zadaniami nieusatysfakcjonowani (dość powiedzieć, że większość czasu po prostu wciskamy klawisz ""idź naprzód"" i rozglądamy się), ale ci, którzy załapią konwencję, że nie o to w tym chodzi, że liczy się przede wszystkim historia i to, co czuje postać, w którą się wcielamy, z dużym prawdopodobieństwem będą zachwyceni.  

Nieprzypadkowo gra jest pierwszoosobowa, bo gdybyśmy patrzyli na Ellisa z boku, nie dałoby się tak dobrze oddać jego narastającej paranoi, lęku i wewnętrznego bólu. Nieprzypadkowo nie jest zbyt długa (na YT znajdziecie walkthrough 3.5 godziny, mnie zajęła 7), bo to optymalna długość dla tego konkretnego rodzaju historii i więcej psychika bohatera mogłaby zwyczajnie nie wytrzymać. Nieprzypadkowo w niektórych sekwencjach chodzimy w kółko po zapętlonej ścieżce - w lesie, w wąwozie czy nawet w finale, w domu znanym z filmu - co niektórzy gracze mogą uznać za nudne i frustrujące (historio, rusz się w końcu!), ale znowu - bez tego trudno byłoby nam uwierzyć, że postać, której oczami patrzymy na to, co się dzieje, z przerażenia i niezrozumienia zdarzeń z jej udziałem, stopniowo popada w szaleństwo. Bo to właśnie jest w tej historii najważniejsze. Narastająca psychoza Ellisa, która ma również udzielać się nam. Wczucie się w jego sytuację. To my zabłądziliśmy w nawiedzonym lesie, nie bohater, na którego patrzymy z boku. To my potrzebujemy towarzystwa psa, aby czuć się komfortowo. To my mamy przeżywać jego utratę, gdy stracimy go z oczu albo coś mu się stanie. I z tego, co czytam w innych opiniach, twórcom udało się to osiągnąć, bo większość graczy, nawet tych krytycznych, poczuła najpierw dużą sympatię do Bulleta, a potem duże emocje w związku z tym, jak poprowadzono tę postać. Bardzo ciekawie pod kątem storytellingu rozwiązano również to, co musimy zrobić, aby historia miała szczęśliwe zakończenie (bo jest kilka). To zagadka, której rozwiązanie jest w pełni spójne z tym, co widzimy i słyszymy na ekranie, ale możemy mylnie interpretować. Tak - od początku mamy tutaj wskazówki co do końcowych twistów. I o ile pierwszego raczej łatwo się domyślić, o tyle drugiego - jak daliśmy się oszukać wiedźmie z Blair i sami, własnymi decyzjami daliśmy się poprowadzić do złego finału - przewidzieć nie sposób. 

Jako że sam param się wymyślaniem różnych rzeczy, nie mogę nie zwrócić uwagi, że z tej gry wręcz bije artystyczna pasja. Widać, że nie powstała na oklepanym schemacie; że to nie produkt, tylko dopieszczone dzieło sztuki. Widać, że stworzyli ją zapaleńcy, fani gatunku, którzy chcieli stworzyć coś osobistego i oryginalnego. Doceniam to, podziwiam i będę chwalić. 
Sięgnijcie po ""Blair Witch"". Zostańcie sami w domu. Odpalcie ją późnym wieczorem, przy zgaszonym świetle, ze słuchawkami na uszach. Jeżeli nie poczujecie tego samego co ja, jeżeli się nie zachwycicie... jesteście najpewniej ekstrawertykami. Zawsze można doszukać się pozytywów tej sytuacji - chyba jeszcze nigdy test psychologiczny na typ osobowości nie był tak przyjemny! 🙂

Oyuna ilk başladığımda klasik dedektifliğe dayalı korku oyunu gözüyle bakmıştım. Olaylar ilerledikçe bu düşüncem temelde olmasa da değişti. İlk chapterdan son chapter'a kadar hiçbir detayı kaçırmamaya dikkat ettim. Bende, oynarken yaklaşık 6 chapter boyunca bir kafa karışıklığı vardı. Daha sonrasında tüm parçalar yerine oturmaya başladı. O andan itibaren oyundan aldığım zevk iki katına çıktı. Bitirene kadar kafamda takılı kalan bir soru vardı : Verdiğim kararlar oyunun akışını ne kadar etkiliyor ya da hiç etkilemiyor mu? Bunu hâlâ soruyorum çünkü verdiğim kararların bazılarını o an korktuğum için yanlış verdiğimi düşünüyorum. Sona doğru geldiğimde ise gerilimi iliklerime kadar hissettim. Sonuç olarak oyun beklentilerimin üzerinde çıktı hatta beni utandırdı diyebilirim.

Değerlendirme kısmına gelecek olursam, bu oyun benim için ;

1. Korku kategorisinde 10 üzerinden 9.5. Psikolojik korku kategorisinde 10 üzerinden 7.
2. Grafikler gayet iyiydi 10 üzerinden 10 diyebilirim.
3. Oyunun ortalama bitirme süresi 6 taş çatlasa 8 saat. Benim 10 saatte bitirmemin sebebi oyunu 3 saat oynayıp 6 ay sonra tekrar yeni bir başlangıç yapmış olmam.
4. Bu paraya değer mi? Bence şu an yaşadığımız standartlara bakarsam değer. 
5. Hikayesi beni gerçekten etkiledi özellikle son 3-4 chapter. Fakat akılda soru bırakmaları ne kadar etkilemek için yapılsa da birkaç yerde gerçekten saçma belirsizlikler olduğunu düşünüyorum. 10 üzerinden puan verirsem 8 verirdim.

Son olarak eklemek isterim, oyunu almadan önce önyargılarınız varsa Netflix'te Blair Witch'in filmini izlemenizi tavsiye ederim. Oyunu bitirdikten sonra da izlerseniz anlamadığınız kısımları anlamanıza yardımcı olabilir.",

Да и кстати логика конечно у игры ""железная"", сюжет вообще не логичный, чтобы выйти на хорошую концовку тут надо брать листок и ручку, и записывать ""рецепт"" со всяких сайтов на хорошую концовку. Я понимаю что за хороший финал надо бороться, ну это уже перебор.  Ну по сюжету... Запутанный, мрачный, интересный... просто не хочу спойлерить, в любом случае если хотите поиграть в этот хоррор, то лучше дождитесь скидки, я все же не думаю что он тянет на свою цену.",

I found myself fully immersed in this story of Ellis and having a companion like Bullet was a very nice feature you don't get often in a survival horror game.  I enjoyed that the game did not leave me wandering around a huge map for hours trying to navigate my way towards POI's or having to solve too complicated puzzles.  By being able to solve the puzzles and deal with enemies within an average amount of time it let the game move in a very steady pace and i was never bored.  The end sequence in the house to me was the best part and I will play it again in VR mainly because of that.  Also the red video tape feature was amazing and unique I has a lot of fun using that.  I hope the future titles are equally if not greater than this one, thank you for providing me with an awesome game experience that i will remember forever.","Hello I am Tom Poe and I love to play story rich horror games mainly and I would say that I loved your game.

The end sequence in the house to me was the best part and I will play it again in VR mainly because of that.  Also the red video tape feature was amazing and unique I has a lot of fun using that.  I hope the future titles are equally if not greater than this one, thank you for providing me with an awesome game experience that i will remember forever."

I play very few horror games, no jump scares.Blair Witch has some mild scary moments, totally acceptable.

I haven't watched the film with the same title. This game is great, with a well-developed story and stick to the point. The protagonist, Ellis has PTSD, during the gameplay he fights the carve man and fights himself. I am not familiar with this term but after seeing Ellis struggle through shattered memories, jump between old times and the current forest, taking the enemies as the carve man, blaming himself for mistakes he made in wartime - I understand it in a good way.

You also make important choices in the game. I like it when you make big decisions on Bullet. If you give up the exit is simple and right in front of you, but if you insist, the way can be painfully long but eventually you will get what you want and it is rewarding.

This game has multiple endings and I like the one I reached in the first play. It is a bad ending they say, but feels so real. The biggest problem of this game is it has glitches. Good thing is you can reload the near autosaves.","Great Game. Took me 5 hours to finish.

但整个游戏最佳主角的确是子弹。于是我又打了一遍，这次根据攻略我打出了好结局。但还是彼得的下落不明以及狗狗最后没守护在主角的身边，应该是遗漏了什么。但我全程没有杀一个怪，把灯光关了摸着黑走是真的难，估计不想再玩第三遍了。

I really wanted to love this game, but it was pretty disappointing.  
If you have never played other games in this genera such as Outlast, layers of fear or amnesia then this game would probably be pretty good, if not great.  But If you are familiar with the aforementioned games and are hoping for something new, this is not it.

The story was relatively unremarkable and the gameplay felt like the same old routine that I have come to expect from games in the survival, psychological horror genera.  It seems they wanted to make a game like PT or Layers of fear, but the execution left much to be desired and had very little originality.  The puzzles were simple and few. The constant hallucinations, flashbacks and messages from a girlfriend that seemed to have no relevance to the story got old quick.  There were very few jump scares, at least unexpected ones. The enemies were predictable and not very scary, you cant run from them and you cant hide, so this means once you figure out their behaviors and patterns they become all to easy to avoid.  With the exception of a dog named bullet and the one original game mechanic with a video camera that can inexplicably rewind time for specific objects, this game was nothing we haven't seen before.","6/10

Curti muito a Gameplay porque é bem simples e similar a Outlast (movimentação Etc)

No geral o jogo é bem fácil mesmo na dificuldade mais Difícil o que complica de verdade é o fato do jogo ser muito escuro (O que ta correto por ser uma floresta, eu mal veria um palmo na frente do meu nariz se fosse comigo) e também não é muito simples encontrar todos os coletáveis do jogo, senti que muitas vezes o Bullet não encontrava nada.

Falando no mesmo nas poucas vezes que fiquei assustado durante a Gameplay parava e ficava brincando com o Cachorro é importante cuidar bem dele pra ter um final ""melhor"". (Usando o Petisco e brincando)

Como derrotar Bruxa de Blair na vida real: ""Um parente seu se perdeu em uma floresta amaldiçoada?""
Se sim: Não vá até la e chame profissionais
Se não: Não é problema teu, fim

Vou dar Spoiler, lê se quiser:
[spoiler] ""1 - Não tem final feliz no jogo, afinal de contas é Bruxa de Blair só ver os filmes que você vê""

""2 - Eu fiquei meio bravo, porque o final você tem que quebrar o Ciclo de ódio pra não ter o final ruim e acredito que só uma parte bem especifica no fim do jogo é determinante pra isso então as escolhas anteriores acho que não interferem muito (Cuidado com a tela vermelha)""

""3 - A Pior parte e achar que o Bullet na verdade é controlado pela Bruxa pois muitas vezes na gameplay a gente acaba indo para o pior local possível simplesmente por seguirmos ele mas ta no roteiro fazer o que não é?"" [/spoiler]

Sice se to dá vyřešit restartováním hry, ale už i to je příliš otravné a jelikož hra nevede hráče za ručičku a nechá ho klidně bloudit hlubokým lesem, chvílemi jsem se motal v kruzích a snažil se vypátrat, co jsem přehlédl. Cítil jsem se jako Jeníček bez drobečků. To vede k druhému velkému negativu, a to level design. Chápu pointu, proč se vývojáři rozhodli layout hry rozhodit takto (nekonečné loopy, pokud něco uděláte špatně; vše vypadá identicky, což je pochopitelné, protože jste v lese). Tímto se přiblížili k filmové předloze a taktéž umocnili ten pocit bezmoci. Nicméně když dojde k úžasné kombinaci chybějícího scriptu a tohoto level designu, prodlouží se vám doba hraní klidně o hodinu a hráče demotivuje pokračovat. Jako pozitiva hodnotím atmosféru, psího společníka a několik konců, které hráče motivují dohrát hru znovu. Vesměs mohu hru doporučit hráčům, kteří milují atmosferické hororové hry; popřípadě fanoušky filmu.

No me considero un fanático de los juegos de terror o en este caso ""Thriller"" si es que se le puede llamar así, pero desde que vi este juego me llamo la atención, ya que se veía como un juego prometedor, pero al momento de jugarlo no es nada mas que una decepción tras decepción, comenzando por lo molesto que es depender de un npc que es el perro para poder avanzar, muchas veces estaba caminando por el bosque y el perro se quedaba quieto o simplemente el perro se iba tan rápido que era imposible seguirle el rastro, el principal problema con este ultimo comentario es que si el personaje no tiene cerca al perro, se comienza a volver el loco y no tengo problema con que sea una mecánica, pero el problema es que aunque llame al perro, aveces se atascaba o simplemente no venia hacia mi, por lo que la experiencia de juego de por si esta rota, ademas de que el juego no te deja ni siquiera disfrutar de los momentos de ""tensión"" por que tiene la maldita necesidad de cortar esos momentos sin mayor razón, sumado a que se siente tan decepcionante cuanto estas en tu primer encuentro con los ""fantasmas"" y literal la mecánica del juego es la mecánica del juego Alan Wake pero sin el elemento clave que serian las pilas de la linterna, por lo que al final asumo que el resto de enfrentamientos pierden la gracia al tener una luz infinita, por ende no podría decir que este juego fuera ni siquiera un thriller, ya que los momentos de terror se limitan a generar un poco de ""tensión"" para después quitarte esa atmósfera o los enfrentamientos lamentables, que se sienten como si fueran un tramite y algo que se puso a la fuerza.

[h1] Resumen [/h1]
Blair Witch es un juego de terror psicológico en primera persona donde tomas el rol de un ex-policía llamado Ellis, quien se adentra en el oscuro bosque de Black Hills para buscar a un niño desaparecido. Durante su travesía, cuenta con la ayuda de su perro Bullet, quien lo guía y lo protege mientras explora el bosque, enfrentándose a misteriosas y aterradoras entidades. El juego combina exploración, acertijos y una narrativa que se desarrolla lentamente a lo largo del tiempo.

[h1] Gráficos 8/10 [/h1]
Los gráficos de Blair Witch son sólidos, con un diseño detallado del bosque oscuro y sombrío, que contribuye a la atmósfera general del juego. Sin embargo, presenta problemas de optimización para altas resoluciones, lo que puede afectar la experiencia en algunas configuraciones. A pesar de esto, en resolución 1080p el juego se ve bien y cumple con su objetivo de generar una sensación de claustrofobia y desconcierto mientras exploras los entornos sombríos.

[h1] Terror 7/10 [/h1]
Blair Witch no se basa tanto en el terror directo, sino en el suspenso y la tensión. El uso de efectos sonoros, la presencia de lo desconocido y la relación con Bullet crean una sensación constante de inquietud. Aunque hay momentos de sorpresa y apariciones de entidades, el terror está más enfocado en el ambiente psicológico que en sustos repentinos. El ritmo del juego al principio puede hacer que algunos jugadores se desconecten, pero a medida que avanzas, el juego mejora y la atmósfera se vuelve más opresiva.

[h1] Conclusion 7.5/10 [/h1]
Blair Witch es un juego de terror psicológico con una atmósfera tensa y una narrativa intrigante, apoyada por su fiel compañero Bullet. Aunque tiene problemas de optimización en resoluciones más altas y un comienzo algo lento, la experiencia mejora a medida que avanza. Su enfoque en el suspenso y no tanto en el terror directo lo hace destacar en ese aspecto. Si te gustan los juegos de misterio y suspenso, es una opción interesante para probar, pero no ofrece una gran rejugabilidad a mi parecer, solo para platinarlo.",

It's a shame as the rest of the game, when I'm not wandering, is relatively enjoyable, the forest looks beautiful, and it keeps you feeling isolated.

It was really difficult to get this game to run. At first it wouldn't open at all, then it wouldn't work on my widescreen, and finally it only work in 1920x1080. Once I started playing though, I almost abandoned the game early in. The first 1-2 hours are pretty boring, very slow paced, and tedious. It does improve the further into the game you go however, and the final two chapters are pretty good and have some genuine spookiness to them.

I got this for $8 and that's about the right price.","---{ Graphics }---

整体不会很恐怖，全流程大概耗时3-5小时，开局一人一狗走遍森林。手电筒和摄像机是解密的和战斗的根本，解密难度不大，除了锯木厂解密范围偏大一点外，其他都是小范围解密。
比起物理上的恐怖，精神恐怖和压力会比较多，前期偏向悬疑，最后一章大概接近一小时游戏时间，恐怖氛围压力拉满，玩的我都要精神崩溃（不是）

Absolutely an awesome psychic horror story if you read the letters and listen to everything. 

But about the game:
The begin starts good until you stuck in the forest and also in a loop. But dont worry you need to use your dog and keep looking around everywhere and think about it when you back at the center of the loop look around and think which way did i missed.

Also the video tapes will help you or the phone.

This is not a horror survival game, you need to do your job to find the missing boy and looking for evidence.
But the memories/flashbacks of your character makes me psycho, everything changes in the wood and that is so weird and when you get deeper in the game how more it will be come.
Your dog is you pall and you need him to stay close agains that monster. Also that dog gave me flashbackes to my dog who i have to sleep because he was old, this is coming emotional in this game. The dog if your FRIEND!
And the Dark or fog in the forests makes it also scary and make me alert agains that creature... walking slow.. looking more around and use camera with night stand.

Overall the game got 3 ends, i had the bad 1 :(

I can only give a 10 for this game because of:

-Good story
-Great soundtrack, perfect combined with the locations where you walk or the moments when you are in danger.
-Great graphics and atmosphere in the Forest.
-And not boring, you need to keep pushing.

10+

First and foremost this game is basically a walking Horror Sim.  So think of like MYST but scary shit happens.  There is a ton of walking essentially in circles waiting for something to trigger so you can progress.

PROS:  Really good graphics (turn of motion blur as its kinda a bit much) 
What really shines in this game is the atmosphere created by the use of light (getting dark vision tunneling in etc)  but the music builds with crazy cresendos and its pretty crazy immersive.

Cons: I used a controller and the controls were pretty janky for the Bullet comands and inventory.  You hold say LB hit the thumbstick where you want and release the bumper.  If you release the stick it almost always does the wrong action.  Which is fine for the inventory but try punishing your dog when you meant to praise him type deal and that sucks.

The only other Con is the game gets really repetitive towards the end.  Like I figured out the story and the twist (for the most part) and it was kinda just me playing on stream for like 20-30 mins just to finish the game.

There are 2 endings and I got one of them. the other is a bit of a challenge.  

Overall: The game is pretty amazing for a first time play through I doubt I will ever play it again.  The controller support was a bit janky and KBM was kinda fucked.  What really makes this game is the use of found footage and just the level of Atmosphere created by visual and audio.  Honestly for what it is this game is a master piece GJ Bloober Team I look forward to more games in your catalogue.  I would say like 9/10 just the ending with the house after watching Blair With and the Remake just lasted a bit long in my opinion.","So this will be mainly spoiler free assuming you watched the OG movie.

[u]Blair Witch[/u] is an enjoyable adaptation of the classic found footage films of the same title. I have never seen the films despite loving the horror genre – but then again you do not have to have seen them either. The game adaptation is based on the movie’s events and lore, but in the end, the game is its own self-contained plot. This entry is simple to play and offers a lot of rich stories to take part in. It also features a powerful emotional core – your trusted buddy [i]Bullet[/i] – that effortlessly keeps the player invested in the story’s development and outcome. Additionally, you are also treated to a video recorder that can manipulate reality. Investigating the different tapes you find to extract clues from them was immersive and fun. The camera also is required to navigate certain dangerous levels. These were tense moments that required stealth and offered new perspectives to keep the game progress unique and refreshing.

[i]We are being watched, stay close, Bullet![/i]

The story of [u]Blair Witch[/u] kicks off with our protagonist, Ellis, who joins a search party with the local Sheriff’s department to find Peter, a young boy who suddenly disappeared. As with most horror stories – all is not what it seems. Ellis is a troubled man with good intentions. Past mistakes in the line of duty have plagued his psyche for years – and finding this missing boy might be his last effort to make amends.

However, the forest is watching, and it wants to exploit Ellis’ vulnerability for Evil. Luckily, Ellis is not alone. He has the best partner any man in his situation could have – a dog! Bullet quickly steals the spotlight. He is at the front and center of Ellis’ chance at redemption, and an overall emotional powerhouse that kept me invested in the story and its outcome. You have a lot of freedom with how you interact with Bullet, but be warned, your morality will be tested. Do not let desperation overcome.

An interesting aspect of [u]Blair Witch[/u] that surprised me was its level design and layout. It tricks the player. The player explores semi-open areas as they hike deeper and deeper into the forest. At first, these areas seem frustratingly large and hard to decipher. The truth however is quite different and clever. You are stuck in an area loop until you complete a set of story-related tasks that allow you to progress into the next area. This made for an anxious and confusing walkthrough. Even when I knew my next move, there was an uncertain feeling I could not shake off. I never felt completely safe from the Witch's grasp.

This idea of a loop, or cycle, – is present too in the game’s thematic storytelling. Ellis is a man seemingly stuck in a cycle of violence despite his best efforts to help others. There is also a deeper misdirection here. You are being watched, but your actions are also being manipulated. This game muddles your decision-making and very easily tricks you into an ending you might not have wished from the very beginning. If you care about this sort of stuff, make sure you're paying attention to what exactly is the purpose of the Blair Witch is and how you might be overlooking her influence.

As an aside, [u]Blair Witch[/u] also pays good attention to detail. The ‘looping’ level design does not hinder this game’s ability to present us with interesting and unique set locations, and they are all not limited to just the forest either. I enjoyed all the documents you collect throughout the way as well – they are relevant to the story, come from varied sources, provide interesting background, and are quick to read. Ellis also has a cellphone that is full with fun mini-game diversions, side quests, and curious achievements.","[i]A cursed woods awaits those brave enough to confront their worst…[/i]

[u]Blair Witch[/u] is an enjoyable adaptation of the classic found footage films of the same title. I have never seen the films despite loving the horror genre – but then again you do not have to have seen them either. The game adaptation is based on the movie’s events and lore, but in the end, the game is its own self-contained plot. This entry is simple to play and offers a lot of rich stories to take part in. It also features a powerful emotional core – your trusted buddy [i]Bullet[/i] – that effortlessly keeps the player invested in the story’s development and outcome. Additionally, you are also treated to a video recorder that can manipulate reality. Investigating the different tapes you find to extract clues from them was immersive and fun. The camera also is required to navigate certain dangerous levels. These were tense moments that required stealth and offered new perspectives to keep the game progress unique and refreshing.

The story of [u]Blair Witch[/u] kicks off with our protagonist, Ellis, who joins a search party with the local Sheriff’s department to find Peter, a young boy who suddenly disappeared. As with most horror stories – all is not what it seems. Ellis is a troubled man with good intentions. Past mistakes in the line of duty have plagued his psyche for years – and finding this missing boy might be his last effort to make amends.

Blair Witch to klasyczna gra przygodowa będąca mieszanką thrillera i horroru. Chociaż znajduje się w niej sporo zawartości podwyższającej klimat grozy trudno nazwać ją jednak typowym horrorem. Bliższe będzie jej określenie dreszczowca przyprawionego łagodną wersją grozy. Twórcy przy tworzeniu tej gry garściami czerpali z produkcji takich jak ""Zaginięcie Ethana Cartera"" czy ""Alan Wake"". Obie te produkcje bardzo wyraźnie przychodzą na myśl podczas ogrywania fabuły. Z pierwszej z nich zaczerpnięto główną fabułę - zaginięcie małego chłopca, oraz elementy rozgrywki jak na przykład możliwość prowadzenia drezynki, która jest naprawdę rewelacyjnie pasującym do klimatu gry dodatkiem. Z drugiej produkcji wyciągnięto z kolei mechanikę odstraszania latarką wroga, bo chociaż nie jest to system który doświadczamy tak często jak w grze ""Alan Wake"", to jednak jest to podstawowa metoda obrony i nie sposób pominąć tutaj podobieństwa. Nie znaczy to jednak że w grze nie wprowadzono żadnych oryginalnych pomysłów. Dodanie chociażby psiego towarzysza jest powiewem świeżości w podobnych tego typu produkcjach. Fabuła gry jest klarowna i nie ma problemu z jej zrozumieniem. Mimo wszystko elementy nadprzyrodzone wydają się zbytnio przekoloryzowane i zbyt nierealne, a reakcja na nie głównego bohatera jakby może nie tyle co były naturalne jak nie były mu obce sprawia że najzwyczajniej po prostu nie czuje się efektu zdziwienia czy zaskoczenia pojawiającymi się wydarzeniami o adekwatnym dla nich poziomie. 


[h1]Plusy:[/h1]
- Ciekawie zapowiadająca się fabuła
- Ładna, chociaż nie wybitna grafika
- Implementacja psiego towarzysza o bardzo oryginalnej mechanice i cechach kluczowych dla przebiegu fabuły
- Zastosowanie ciekawych mechanik rozgrywki jak na przykład możliwość jazdy drezynką

[h1]Minusy:[/h1]
- Przesadzone elementy związane z wydarzeniami paranormalnymi oraz zbyt naturalne reakcje na nie głównego bohatera
- Krytyczne błędy gry które kilkakrotnie pojawiły się podczas przechodzenia fabuły skutkujące wyrzucaniem gry do pulpitu niezwiązane z wydajnością podzespołów, ponieważ były rozgrywane na sprzęcie o wysokiej wydajności
- Optymalizacja gry w przypadku wydajnego sprzętu na stabilnym poziomie, jednak można by oczekiwać lepszego jej dopracowania, tym bardziej że na dobrym sprzęcie otrzymujemy ""jedynie"" pogranicze dobrej wydajności w postaci niewielu powyżej 60 kl/s


[h1]Podsumowanie:[/h1]
Dla każdego miłośnika gier przygodowych jest to produkcja godna polecenia. Chociaż nie sposób pominąć jej wad, wyłania się obraz ciekawej mieszanki wielu gier przygodowych połączonych ze świeżymi mechanikami. W wielu miejscach pojawia się odczucie powtarzalności, ale przełamują ją absorbujące posunięcia fabularne. Nie sposób wydać tutaj innej oceny niż pozytywna, jednak do ideału jeszcze dużo brakuje.

Although I like this game, it's never perfect. It has both great points and imperfections. For this game, I'm not comparing it with other horror games, but judging it as itself: For the visual QUALITY rating, I would give it a 10/10 due to it's realism and immersive experience. 10/10 for the story. I thought it was great in a psychological sense and loved how some twists were thrown in as well. But I'm also going to give it only a 5/10 for its inconsistent camera motions and effects.....

The graphics were very nice and the woods felt realistic and dark. It was both original and interesting that we can have a dog companion that helps lead us through sections of the game. However, there were a lot of sections that made me dizzy and gave me a headache. This is not the game's fault, as I have some health issues that are triggered by this game. The game does warn us about these things at the very beginning though, so I'm not slamming the game in anyway for not warning us. My review is my own opinion on the game experience. Also, as I've said before, it would be inconsistent and could be smooth one minute and then make me feel uncomfortable the very next. Some scenes trick me in a way. I could start a chapter thinking it's playable and have to stop midway in middle of chapter. I felt like some parts were a bit too much. Especially the end chapters with looping and distortions. I almost threw up a few times and it wasn't just a minute or two event. It literally would last for 10 to 15 minutes...

Definitely recommend the game for MOST players. If you have sensitivity to sounds, lights, flashing, distortions, etc, do not, I repeat DO NOT play this game.

The game itself feels like a walking-simulator through all kinds of spooky woods (Which are indeed very atmospheric and well designed just from the pure looks.) with random PTSD-flashbacks and random monsters attacking you once or twice in between.
Here begins the trap maker's art of the devs: One of the first instincts you have in a horrogame which takes place in very, very dark gloomy woods, is to whip out a flashlight that also kills monsters. You destroy the evil witch's totems and collect strange figurines along the way. After you have done all this you realise in the final chapter that you turned batshit crazy and kill everyone while your mental illness wrecks your brain because you killed all the monsters, destroyed her totems and picked up the fricking collectables the game shoves in your face.

As a matter of fact, the devs decided that this glorious ending should take place in a very special enviroment: You wander through an abandoned house in the woods. For. Fricking. Hours. 
I quit halfway through. This kind of gameplay is neither funny, nor entertaining, nor spooky or whatever the devs were thinking it was supposed to be.

I am mighty dissapointed in the game. If you want a mediocore spoopy game with occasional jumpscares and stereotypic ""that one guy with the mental health issue went insane and killed everyone"", buy it.
For everyone else: Be happy that you didn't waste your time on this one.

Итак, почему вообще пишу этот отзыв – в финальных титрах разработчики просили дать обратную связь, что я охотно и делаю. 
Как я вообще дошёл до финальных титров? Если бы не стримил игру и не было поддержки со стороны ребят – не прошел бы и бросил в начале, говорю как есть. И спасибо подписчикам за поддержку.
Взял игрушку поскольку заинтересовал трейлер. Помня ещё фильм «про студентов в лесу» моей молодости, предвкушал как минимум не скучное путешествие.
Уже в самом начале надежда на нескучный процесс начала увядать как цветок без воды – игра крайне нетороплива и не поворотлива, тягуча как дёготь. Можно возразить, мол это для атмосферы! Но вот нет её от слова совсем: «Не верю, не верю!». Если для кого-то атмосферой является нудное невнятное брожение по лесу, тогда да. Поверьте, я любитель побродить, но это не про эту игру. На час ходьбы приходится 3-5 минут экшена и далее опять на старые рельсы. 
Сюжет не сможет предложить ничего интригующего, хотя нет, обманываю: пара-тройка любопытных моментов будет, как и полускримеров, но на этом всё. Самый оргазм маразма начинается в финальной главе – на мой взгляд из неё бы, пожалуй, как раз и стоило сделать игру, по крайней мере сделать основную ставку, в этом случае картина получилась куда более психоделичной и интересной, пусть и короткой.
При моем конфиге (i7 7700K GTX 1070 32Gb) игра умудрялась тормозить на средних настройках в разрешении 2к с отключенным сглаживанием и всеми улучшайками, хотя при этом звезд с неба и не хватает. Толи чудо, толи фокус.
Исходя из вышенаписанного, не стал бы не рекомендовать игру, поскольку есть и другие более достойные внимания, взять, к примеру, инди хоррор Unforgiving - A Northern Hymn схожей тематики. Но опять же субъективное мнение.
Если всё же решите брать Blair Witch, то советую дождаться скидки на неё, но приобретать за полный ценник.

游戏总体表现优秀，尤其在画面和氛围上着重下了功夫，代入感十足。跳脸惊吓这种低级手段倒是少见（好欸），整体还是靠氛围。但是游戏节奏上把握一般，在前期的树林寻路，尾声的用摄像机沿着白线走，以及终章的木屋，游戏节奏都显得有些冗长和拖拉。我认为无谓的寻路则是这款游戏最大的问题。游戏节奏把握最好的要说是中期的矿车段到伐木场，那段的探索和解密颇有意思。
玩家还将拥有一只名叫子弹的狗子，游戏中起到寻路寻物的作用，可以抚摸和喂食；以及一台功能齐全的老式手机，甚至可以在手机上玩贪吃蛇。这些跳离主游戏旋律的设定多少能缓解紧张恐怖的氛围，就显得格外亲切有趣。
游戏叙事很有意思，前期碎片化的回忆，无端的幻象，在最终凑成一个完整的故事。
游戏瑕不掩瑜，值得入手体验。

剧情上也很好理解，但是要是有通关之后一头雾水的朋友，简单理一下背景剧情
主角曾在战场上错误领导战友，导致战友误入敌方埋伏全队阵亡，而主角在躲避敌方士兵的搜查时误入了一名平民家中，由于害怕平民发出声响暴露自己，主角将其杀害（故意或是误杀交代的不清楚），主角也因此患上心理创伤，在之后警局工作中，一次出警，错误的判断导致他开枪打死了一名并未携带武器的青年嫌犯。两件事加起来终于警长选择交给他一条警犬，让他担任训犬员的工作，不再派他执行任务。但是，当主角听闻那名嫌犯的哥哥（或弟弟）在树林失踪时，还是按耐不住赎罪的心情，独自驱车前往寻找。至此，游戏开始。

99947499,russian,2021.08.25 20:52,✅,✅,0.5,0,"Blair Witch оставила после прохождения какие-то смешанные чувства. Игра сделана по мотивам фильма (я смотрела только 1 часть) , но ведьмой тут и не пахнет, как в принципе и в фильме.  У игры очень много интересных фишек, которых я не видела у других. Сразу выделю:
- Взаимодействие пленки камеры с реальным временем. ""Ведьма из Блэр"" построена так, что в лесу ты будешь ходить кругами, возвращаться в одно и то же место, если что-то не сделаешь. Нужно тщательно смотреть пленки, чтобы правильно продолжить игру. 
- Еще раз повторюсь, что тематика интересна тем, как игра на тебя будет давить повторением мест. Типо реально страшно, что ты возвращаешься как проклятый туда, откуда пришел. Это по-началу пугало, но на половине игры начало бесить. 
- Песик. Это ИИ который служит не просто как дополнение к главному герою, а как отдельный компаньон. Он может искать предметы, находить путь, показать где монстр, да и вообще с ним можно много взаимодействовать( покормить, похвалить). Хотя и с ним были проблемы, когда он заводил меня в одно и то место, мотал круги, а локации повторялись. 
- Это не похоже на хоррор. Психологический триллер скорее всего. Когда играешь реально сопереживаешь герою, его прошлому. В игре есть еще разделение времен: реальное, параллельное, прошлое. Под конец ваще психоделика. У меня рассудок падал вместе с гг))))
   
 Ну вот все отличия в принципе. Минусов тоже хватает. Лично у меня игра вызывала частые головные боли и подгорание пятой точки. Она не страшная, а скорее нудная. Ей не хватает  скримеров и какого-то большего чувства беспомощности. Монстры тут статичные, пиздов могут и не дать. Слишком много нужно искать начиная от всяких улик, тотемов и  заканчивая мусором!!! Лучше бы не делали симулятор детектива)
Игре ставлю 7 из 10 за оригинальность!",
99924272,polish,2021.08.25 11:49,❌,❌,0.5052672625,2,"Bardzo chiałbym pozytywnie ocenić grę Blair Witch i pomimo tego że nie mogłem się doczekać kiedy tylko wyjdzie ta gra, muszę dać jednego wielkiego minusa nie bez powodów - a jest ich całkiem sporo. Dodam, że lubię film Blair Witch Project ( do którego gra w pewnym stopniu nawiązuje) i inne np. Rec 1, 2, Kwarantanna, i Conjuring.
Żeby nie zniechęcić tym wpisem do zagrania i spróbowania osoby zainteresowane, wady tej gry będą pod koniec, a zacznę od plusów.
- wykonanie otoczenia i lasu to mistrzostwo! Chyba najbardziej realistycznie zrobiony i najładniejszy motyw lasu jaki do tej pory widzieliśmy w grach. Eksploracja i przemierzanie go sprawiają że mamy wrażenia jak byśmy byli w autentycznym lesie.
- nasz kompan, czyli owczarek niemiecki! Bardzo fajny pomysł na interakcję z naszym psiakiem, pomaga nam w sygnalizowaniu zagrożenia, szukaniu drogi jak zabłądzimy i szukaniu znajdziek. Możemy też dostosować wygląd naszego zwierzaka. Ogółem bardzo fajny pomysł.
- mechanika związana z kamerą - zmiana rzeczywistości za pomocą nagrań - przyznam że to zrobiło na mnie wrażenie, że tak jak w Outlastach słuzy nam tylko do uzywania trybu noktowizji oraz zbierania materiałów, tak w Blair Witch zbieramy taśmy które wpływają w pewien sposób na zmianę otoczenia - prościej to co widzimy na nagraniu a nie ma obok nas staję się prawdziwe po obejrzeniu i zatrzymaniu filmu. Bardzo fajny i czasem scary motyw.
- walka ze zjawami - w przeciwieństwie do serii Outlast ( którą bardzo lubię ) gdzie monotonny system uciekania jakby nasz bohater nie potrafił sprzedać przynajmniej luja ogłuszacza, możemy tutaj walczyć z naszymi przeciwnikami za pomocą światła ( motyw ala Alan Wake). Jak dla mnie przyjemny element gameplayu, a i też moze nami wzdrygnąć nie raz.
- system ekwipunku gdzie mamy telefon, radio i inne elementy do uzytku bardzo fajna sprawa. Mam wrażenie, że lekko zainspirowany RE7 ale mogę sie mylić.
- fabuła która mimo wszystko nie jest zaskakująca jak w RE7 ale kilka rzeczy może sie w niej podobać - pewne momenty zapamiętamy na długo.
- udźwiękowienie tak samo jak grafika i otoczenie na wysokim poziomie.
Chyba tyle z takich najważniejszych zalet Blair Witch. Teraz coś o wadach i powodach dlaczego daje minus.. ehh az nie wiem od czego zacząć, ponieważ...
Licznik na moim steamie pokazuje 9h, z czego 3h poświęcone na uruchomienie gry, z powodu nie kończącego się ekranu wczytywania.
6h to rzeczywisty czas gry gdzie nie dostałem jakichkolwiek osiągnieć za postęp w grze!.
Spędzilem dodatkowe 2-3h na szukanie odpowiedzi na te problemy i w dziale dyskusji dowiedziałem się że u wielu graczy wystąpiły rózne i inne problemy niż u mnie. Brak zapisów w grze, nie konczące sie wczytywanie, wywalanie do pulpitu, crashe i zabugowane animacje/cutscenki. I wygląda tak jakbysmy mieli na steamie kilka chyba z 10 różnych kopii Blair Witch. Błedy które wystąpily u innych graczy nie wystąpiły u mnie i zaś odwrotnie. Nie uzyskałem odpowiedzi na to czemu nie mam osiągnieć za postęp w grze. Co do niekończącego ekranu wyczytywania , znalazłem rozwiazanie które omija to czyli skopiowanie save'u z początku gry od innego gracza. Dostałem odpowiedzi wcześniej że mam słaby PC itd skoro gra mi sie nie wczytuje. Lecz nie mogło to być powodem skoro osoby z najlepszymi kartami graficznymi i procesorami nie mogły również odpalic tej gry albo im wywalało crasha. Ta cała masa błędów sprawiła że klimat i magia Blair Witcha zniknęła szybciej niż reinstall tej gry. Nie miałem takich odczuć i sytuacji przy każdym Outlaście z kolei. Zawsze otrzymało się gotowy produkt w pełni sprawny i przede wszystkim przetestowany od A do Z przed wypuszczeniem na rynek.
Z wad bezpośrednio dotyczacych gameplayu to mianowicie 2 rzeczy zauważylem:
- zmarnowanie potencjału lasu - niby mamy poczucie ogromnego obszaru, który nie dokońca został zagospodarowany a mógł być lepiej, bo jak zawsze wybierałem jakiś inny kierunek w którym iść to i tak dotrzemy w miejsce w które mamy wg twórców dotrzeć w tym czasie. I druga sprawa:
- totemy laleczek - niby zbieramy je by je zniszczyć ale nic to nie daje, albo nie zauważyłem. Niby nawiazują w dany sposób do wiedźmy i magii, ale miałem wrażenie, że twórcy nie skończyli lub pospieszyli się z wydaniem gry, bo wydaje sie że miały słuzyc do czegoś innego. Np. Jak w grze Conjuring House ( obecnie tyt. Dark Occult) niszczenie ich osłabiało Demona. Więc taki motyw miał być tutaj skoro chodzimy i postać niszczy je gdzie pojawia się dany dźwięk jakby coś to powodowało.
Podsumowując, wyszedł z tego długi tekst i nie wiem czy ktokolwiek przeczytał całość. Daje minus tej grze, spowodowany wypuszczeniem nie dopracowanego tytulu który u jednych działa u innych nie. Możliwe że to wina kopii jaką mam, a ktos i inny będzie mógł grać bez problemów.

《布莱尔女巫》是一款第一人称恐怖揭秘游戏，其灵感源自一个名为《Blair Witch》的系列电影。玩家在游戏中会享受到一段电影版的剧情体验，惊悚、悬疑、神秘的氛围令人印象深刻，尽管游戏性方面的不完美让本作可能难以成为经典之作，不过好在游戏的质量总体而言还是不错的。

一、电影般的游戏体验
本作秉承了《布莱尔女巫》系列电影在表现上的手法和风格，带给玩家电影般的体验。《布莱尔女巫》的系列电影采用的是伪纪录片的表现手法，通过DV影像的形式来呈现故事，营造出真实感。这一点在本游戏的开场也有所体现，游戏主界面的DV机也是呼应了电影系列中的DV这一重要的元素，由此也可以看出本作与电影系列确实有着比较深的渊源。游戏中讲述的故事剧情虽然与电影系列的情节并不存在什么直接的瓜葛，但发生的年代相近，地点相同，都涉及到女巫布莱尔以及和她相关的巫术元素，因此可以看成是同一个世界观下的不同作品。
就本作而言，在运镜和分镜上都有比较强烈的电影感，故事通过主角与环境互动触发剧情来推动，其间穿插着的对话也起到讲述剧情的作用。不错的画面质量和写实的画面风格加强了这种伪纪录片的风格，很多细节也与故事背景——90年代的美国相吻合，因此代入感和沉浸感都比较强烈。主角的诺基亚很有意思，年代感很强，功能也非常有趣，更重要的是手机里面的小游戏真的可以玩！

二、二号主角——有趣的狗子
在游戏中主角需要进入森林寻找失踪的学生，但主角的身体和精神状态并不是很好，他必须在忠实的伙伴——一只名为子弹的狗子的帮助下才能进行搜救任务并确保自己的安全，于是这只狗子便当之无愧的成为了本作的第二主角，这也是本作的一个亮点。玩家与狗子面对面时可以进行互动，有寻找，紧靠，抚摸、别动、斥责五个互动选项。寻找的选项可以让狗子去帮忙寻找线索，这个是最实用的功能，遇事不决的时候就让狗子找一找好了。抚摸估计是可以增进感情吧，斥责应该就是相反了，因为游戏中的说明提到与狗子的互动会对它之后的行为产生影响。紧靠可以让狗子保护主角。在剧情前期，主角会因为狗子离开而陷入恐惧，狗子回到身边后就恢复了理智，可见狗子的重要性。

三、游戏性尚可，但还不够好
玩家在游戏中需要搜集各种线索和物品，游戏过程中具有解谜的玩法，恐怖感方面虽然不是特别吓人但营造得也是比较到位的。尽管本作“步行模拟器”玩法（大部分时间里玩家都是在到处走动）的时间比较长，但总体而言是一款不错的恐怖惊悚游戏。但游戏地图比较大，各个地点的区分度较小，加之游戏剧情里存在一些鬼打墙的设定，所以玩家迷失自我的情况可以说是常有发生，迷路之后到处绕圈圈还是很让人上火的，毕竟这对让游戏的节奏变得拖沓了不少。过多的重复和迷路也会在一定程度上稀释恐惧感、增加厌倦感，让游戏剧情的张力被削弱，这一点是本作做得不够好的地方。

四、结语
总体而言，《布莱尔女巫》是一款质量尚可的恐怖解谜游戏，无论是外在表现还是内在玩法都是值得肯定的，虽然游戏节奏。之前出现的中文显示异常问题目前也已经得到了解决，对于喜欢这类题材的玩家来说是一款值得体验的游戏。",

Du suspense, la stabilité mentale du personnage principal rudoyée, de bons graphismes. Le ""personnage"" de Bullet est bien trouvé pour l'ancrage dans la réalité et dynamiser un peu le déroulement de l'histoire.
Le point le plus négatif, pour moi, est le manque d'influence du joueur sur le récit. Ca n'enlève rien à sa qualité, plutôt bonne, mais je m'attendais à avoir un peu plus d'impact...
L'ambiance des derniers chapitres est réussie là encore, mais ils auraient peut être gagnés à être un peu écourtés. Possible que j'ai raté des éléments narratifs (?).

Глупые, ломающиеся и постоянно застревающие в текстурах деревьев монстры, которые появляются совершенно ожидаемым образом. Скримеры весьма посредственные и шаблонные. Блуждание по лесу абсолютно неинтересно, неимоверно затянуто и совершенно не пугает. 

Техническая часть игры оставляет желать лучшего. Пугалки застревают, главный герой периодически тоже, собака также иногда лагает. Скрипты порой работают странно и не срабатывают, приходилось не раз перезагружать игру, чтобы продвинуться. Головоломки весьма второсортны, типа найди вентиль в кромешной тьме и покрути. 

Что касается сюжета, то это настолько шаблонная и посредственная тягомотина, что не вызывает совершенно никакого отклика и сопереживания. Здесь намешали абсолютно все, что можно и мистическую ведьму, и травмы, и шизофрению, и ошибки прошлого, и пропажу ребенка, и маньяка. Из-за подобного коктейля, перестаешь соображать и улавливать сюжет. Порой просто забываешь, что пропал какой-то ребенок и мы его вроде как ищем. 

Главный герой... Это просто один из самых бесхребетных, истеричных и глупых гг хорроров, которые только есть.  Эллис не вызывает ни уважения, ни сострадания. Такой персонаж заслуживает только плохой концовки. Кстати об этом, путь к концовкам, хорошей или плохой, совершенно невозможно проследить логически. Если в Layers of Fear хоть отдаленно можно было понять к чему идет главный герой, то здесь ничего не ясно.

Единственное, что в игре вызывает эмоции - это бедная собака, которую главный герой таскает по лесу. 

У игры есть и пара плюсов. Это довольно интересное взаимодействие с Буллетом (собакой), решение с кассетами, которые находит главный герой, грамотная игра с меняющимся окружением.

Может понравиться только фанатам оригинала Ведьмы из Блэр.",

Una gran carta de amor por parte de Bloober Team al gran clásico cinematográfico del género de terror found footage estrenado en 1999. Han sabido crear una muy buena atmósfera aderezada con unas pinceladas de conceptos jugables muy acertados. tanto para el tipo de juego que es, como para el universo donde cierne sus bases. Entramos de lleno en una historia de búsqueda, tanto literal como personal, en la que no faltarán buenas raciones de momentos para notar tu piel de gallina. Ojalá que no os spoileen los truquitos que tiene el juego para ponerte un poco nervioso.

Agradezco de una manera infinita que para el desarrollo del título se haya optado por un mayor uso del terror psicológico, del que hacía gala la obra original, frente a los clásicos y manidos jumpscares. Esto le da muchísima personalidad y resulta muy interesante para quienes gustamos más de este tipo de experiencias.

Para nuestra suerte no estaremos solos, ya que nos acompaña nuestro fiel perrete ayudándonos a encontrar el camino, pistas y por qué no, la posibilidad de interactuar con él dándole las gracias e incluso regañarlo. Este, entre otros, también supone una pieza clave que desembocará en un final u otro dependiendo de nuestro comportamiento y acciones. También contaremos con un inventario (con el cual volver a ver items, releer notas recogidas...) y, para no desvelar sorpresas, varios objetos que nos ayudarán a comunicarnos e iluminar el camino. Para conocedores de la película, sabéis de lo que hablo.

A nivel gráfico cumple pero sigue sin estar mejor optimizado a día de hoy. Cómo dije, al final el apartado artístico ostenta un mayor escalafón, por lo que estaremos más concentrados en las espesas y pesadas arboledas que nos rodean, y los diferentes sonidos que nos envuelven. La música, por otro lado, cumple y es elegante, siendo el main theme una pieza magnífica que casa a la perfección con el título.

Basándose de igual forma en la obra original y la secuela estrenada en 2016, tampoco faltarán multitud de referencias y homenajes. Todos sabemos cómo empieza y cómo acaba. Y sabemos que la cinta original tiene un plano final que hiela la sangre. Y por supuesto, Bloober sabe esto y han utilizado el concepto de una manera super divertida, inteligente y terrorífica. 

Con un buen ritmo, es cierto que en algún momento concreto para según qué jugadores puede tener fallas de cohesión o tempo, además de lo posiblemente aburrido de sus enemigos y mecánicas de lucha, pero consigue remontar de una manera titánica en la última hora, donde se pone toda la carne en el asador mostrando todas sus cartas. A nuestro protagonista, y a nosotros mismos.

Compra muy recomendada para fans de la película y amantes del género de terror en videojuegos que quieran una experiencia un tanto distinta y peculiar, sin distanciarse de las normas establecidas. Un plus importante es que lo terminas y queda claro que este equipo puede hacer, como mínimo, un trabajo interesante con Silent Hill.",

Really good game with an incredible atmosphere and environments. As someone whose favorite game is Alan Wake and who has a similar looking dog whom I go in to the forest at nights, this game was a perfect match.

I've had this game in my radar for over 2 years, but after reading some negativish reviews and being played so many games where the ""mechanics"" are basically watching micro cutscenes inside the gameplay, after pressing a ""use"" button and hearing that ""it's a walking simulator, where you press a button every now and then"" I didn't even bother to buy it with -50% discount and later on took it off from my wishlist.

For some reason a year later or so I stumbled upon it again in Steam and while having an urge to play some atmospheric single player game, I gave it a chance (I'm super picky about games and easilly refund most of them after 20 minutes of gameplay).

Pretty much during the opening cutscene I was already hooked, and after seeing that you can actually customize your dog's fur etc. to your liking before starting the game, I thought that was goddamn cool. The interacting with the dog was so satisfying and the game felt less scary when he was with you. You protect him and he protects you. Such a cool concept.

Really enjoyable game and spent around 6 hours finishing it. Now I do have one thing to complain about. I don't get why these atmospheric story driven games always have to put some boring sub-plots about the protagonist's personal life to make the game more interesting.
To be honest I couldn't give a fuck about the main character's ex-girlfriend and even less what happened to him in the army. Why can't it be about the forest, the witch, the missing kid that we're trying to rescue and the main character and his dog.
Honestly I felt that the relationship with the dog and me was way more interesting and that was what kept me going forward. I didn't care to know what happened in the army, I just cared about that the dog would survive. (to be honest I didn't even care about the kid. I just cared about the damn dog.)

The ending sequence in the house was unnecessary long. I was excited first going in there and 5-20 minutes would have been enough, but for some reason it felt like an hour or two. Way too long and repetitive.

Regards these few negative things I'd say it's totally worth the original price and I give it an 8/10.

They didn’t pull any punches when it came to designing the forest. Of course, the forest was beautiful in the daylight, but really creepy when night fell. Their soundscape was on point. At times, it sounded like something was out there breaking sticks/stepping on leaves, and my whole body was tense waiting for something to pounce out at me. If you watched the original movie, you’ll recognize some of the sounds, which added an extra layer to everything. Beyond that you also find those stick idols and see some extra creepy things in those woods. Needless to say, I liked the ways they incorporated and expanded upon the Blair Witch lore.

I loved their attention to the time setting as well. Your phone looks like an old Nokia, it can play Snake, you can choose to call whoever you want in your phonebook – I ended up annoying the pizza guy… The video camera speaks to the found-footage style of the original movie and you’ll even find polaroids of the Witch’s victims throughout the forest.

On the other hand, I think the biggest short-coming is the shortness. $30 can seem a bit steep for only seven hours, but the game does have multiple endings, meaning you can play it a few more times and get a new experience out of it. I’m just not the type of player to go back and do that.

Another gameplay aspect that pulled me out of immersement was when Ellis got caught in “loops”. For example, you fall into a small crevasse and walk and walk and walk and walk. As you do, words slowly, very slowly, take form on the walls. I could see the effect the Bloober Team was trying to achieve, but it just dragged on too long. It lost any effect on me. I wasn’t nervous or afraid or anxious. I was just waiting until it was over so I could get on with the story. This happens quite a few times in the process of the game and every time it was done to death, pulling me straight out of sense of unease into a sense of annoyance while I plodded through the levels, waiting to get to the next section of the story.

Когда я только начинала играть в данную игру, то думала, что в ней будет ужасно страшно, много скримеров и неприятных моментов. На самом же деле, эту игру я могу охарактеризовать фразой - ""куда, мать вашу, идти вообще?""

Итак, начнем с самого начала. Маленький мальчик пропадает без вести в лесу Блэк Хиллз в городе Беркитсвиль, штат Мэриленд. Мы подключаетесь к поискам в роли Эллиса, бывшего полицейского с тяжелым прошлым, и верным псом-другом Буллетом. И вот тут, наверное, уже что-то пошло не так... Во-первых, лес. Я думаю, что вы поняли к чему я клоню - бесконечные плутания фиг пойми куда и самое главное - зачем? Мы вроде ищем мальчика, но в то же время пытаемся разобраться со своей жизнью и наладить отношения со своей женщиной, которая, то и дело раздражает всю игру. Это как раз-таки, во-вторых. В-третьих, Эллиса часто мучают флэшбеки (не то что часто, а постоянно) Те, что связаны с его женщиной, и те, что связаны с годами его военно службы. Ну, так вот, что те, что другие флэшбеки меня просто огорчали и по сути никак не раскрывали персонажа. Они только вгоняли его в какую-то яму, превращая в ненормального психопата. Хотя, может, он таковым и является?
Концовок здесь несколько, но, чтобы посмотреть каждую, нужно собирать различные предметы: в какой-то собрать все амулеты, в какой-то вообще их не трогать.
Страшно не было от слова совсем. За исключением пары моментов. Ну, а блуждания по лесу могут выбесить, но никак не напугать.
А, ну, и ведьма... где она вообще? Как выглядит? Почему там обитает? Почему вместо неё мы видим какого-то полуразваливавшегося приемника, что по сути и сделать то нам ничего не может? И много других вопросов....

Я прошла игру один раз и момент, что был в конце в доме ведьмы (как я поняла), совсем меня выбесил и отвернул от игры. Проходить еще раз не планирую, если только для того, чтобы тупо собрать ачивки.",

I personally am very picky for horror games, I either want it to be scary as hell with some nice gameplay like Silent Hill or have some really nice terrifying story like Fran Bow. I couldn't find neither in this game. I would rather prefer giving this a neutral rating.

Blair Witch is a horror game from Makers of Layers of Fear. I did not enjoy that game but I enjoyed Blair Witch a little more.
The game starts quite nicely and the story seems nice and in the beginning everything seems nice. I haven't watched the movie, i've tried but found it boring after 15 minutes so I don't know if this is related to the movie or any witch or something but i don't think it has any relation. It's quite similar to Layers of Fear (in both gameplay and the story) where you imagining things but for some reason they can kill you.

The story is about a man who's suffering from ptsd and can't forget the stuff he's done. So he starts hallucinating in the forest and the whole gameplay is walking through his hallucinations which doesn't make any sense.
The forest is scary but after couple of scares that feeling is completely gone. The character starts remembering more stuff from his past and hallucinations intensify. The forest is really boring. The game is linear but still has few paths to go, only if you take the wrong path you're start going in a loop and end up at the same place until you take the right path.

There are monster who can kill you and you kill them in the same way as in Alan Wake – by shining a flashlight onto them. There's also camera which lets you see the monsters and trails. You can also watch tapes on it which sometimes is needed to shift the reality or maybe turn back the time so you could enter somewhere. You gather items, run, get tired after 20 meters, then walk slowly through same boring woods. So you get the items which are needed to either fix something or open something and move on to another section. While first half of the game was decent, the second half was tedious. Walking in loops over and over again for countless times while the story makes less and less sense. although the idea of the story is quite good but it was executed poorly.
Oh there's a dog. You can take care of him and ask him to get some items for you. He also supposed to show you the way where to go but that doesn't work, he only finds the obvious items. Still having a pet dog is always great.

It's not an action game, it's not a walking sim completely although you mostly walk but since there are puzzles and you can die it's kind of neither.
The main character is a cripple who can't move even light objects or climb over something. That wouldn't be an issue if the places you can't go would have some realistic obstacles which would make sense, not some branch or fallen door. I'm a cripple and i can move the damn doors or smash windows. And this guy is an ex soldier and a cop.

The game is very short although it felt too long. It took me a year to beat it, I just couldn't play for more than 30 minutes and uninstalled it several times until I decided to just finish it.

Save system is non existent, there are only autosaves so you can't end the game whenever you like and some sections may be quite long and tiring.

There are collectibles and multiple endings but no chapter select. It's so annoying because if you miss something you must replay the whole game which is very slow, especially boring when you know everything from the start.

Graphically it looks ok'ish. Some scenes are good but mostly it looks average. There's insane amount of blur all over the screen so you can't see anything and performance is terrible with fps dipping to 45 or lower at times. Runs even worse on max settings. Optimization is terrible. Played on 5800x, 2070s, 32gb @3440x1440. Ultrawide works out of the box.
Graphics options screen is constantly glitching. When you go there it asks to save changes, why? You click ok then it lets you to change the graphics.

Sound is what makes this game more scary. Sound design is great and it creates that creepy atmosphere. Like all horror games it has those extremely loud sounds scaring you sometimes but like I mentioned after and hour or so you get used to it and just want to go your way casually.

I guess it's a decent game for those who only play horror games and don't have high requirements but for me it was boring. The idea of the story is quite good but poorly executed and it would've been an awesome narrative horror game. I really did not enjoy this.

Then there was The Medium.. kinda janky for me but only because of my disability and mental illness, not because of poor design. I respect that they try new things. I originally posted Not Recommended for The Medium, but soon rescinded it because I love Bloober Team and I really want to see them be successful. They deserve it. 

This game is the spookiest and most fun to play Horror game for me since Outlast. I know, I know.. but I have played a lot of horror.. and I'm tellin' ya.. this game performs the hat trick deftly and confidently. Engrossing, Immersive, Gorgeously rendered in realistic detail, creepy AF.. I love it. I would have finished it in one sitting if my body hadn't collapsed from insomnia-induced hallucinations and malnutrition. But coupla winks and I was back at it.. red-eyed, knuckles white on the controller.. gaunt face illuminated only by the glowy 4k UHD wonder screen.. 

Wandered there for a sec.. seriously, if you like horror even a little, this is IT right here. A pleasantly surprised 10/10."

pros!

it's got a lot of cool ideas (tapes, dog being a living objective pointer and threat detector) and little tidbits (e.g. the phone having a proper UI of a classic nokia brick phone).

using tapes in a camcorder to proceed to parts of puzzles and manipulate the environment is pretty dang cool, even if it's a bit limited and somewhat sparse.

the dog is pretty cool, and the game is pretty atmospheric!

cons!

a lot of the cool ideas presented aren't used enough or polished well.

some people have mentioned this but some of the kills during ""combat"" feel entirely accidental at points even if you're following cues

animation can be really stiff and weird looking, and i don't think the people responsible for the interaction have ever seen a dog, or any domesticated animal, given the dogs expressions showing intense stress while you shake his brains out when activating the ""pet"" prompt.

[i]Сразу замечу, что решила поиграть в ""Ведьму"" не под влиянием фильма, а из исключительного любопытства к творчеству блуберов. Штош, время расставить все точки над и, ы и й.[/i]

Лес, фонарь и неведомые твари - классика каждого второго хоррора. Мы, в лице поехавшего кукухой полицейского, ищем потерявшегося (или нет?)  мальчишку, бродим по чаще, свистим котелком все громче и все, что держит нас от окончательного съезда крыши - верный пёс. Казалось бы, все ничего, типичный симулятор ходьбы с шорохами, скрипами и рычанием, однако блуберы, как им свойственно, разбавили геймплей парой замечательных механик... И критически испоганили игровой опыт чуть ли не всем остальным (что было для меня... неприятным сюрпризом).

[b]Плюсы:[/b]
+ Лес, который нам дают исследовать, не такой большой, потеряться здесь особо не выйдет - и слава богу.
+ Вот это да, нам дали телефон, с которого можно донимать знакомых (и не только) и рацию.
+ Крутая механика с видеокамерой - с помощью неё можно мотать время. Такое бы да в крупный проект, эх...
+ Собачка. Просто собачка. Её можно кормить, гладить, выбрать ей цвет ошейника, глаз и шерсти, а еще она будет помогать нам на протяжении всей игры.
+ Интересная концепция монстров (не тех уродцев, что бегали по лесу и стремились цапнуть нас за попец, а тех, что нападали, если на них посмотреть).
+ Типичные побегушки с дверями и психодел, какой встречается только у блуберов.

[b]Минусы:[/b]

- Лаги. Чертовы лаги, которые вынесли мне мозг, особенно в последней главе (и из-за которых мне в итоге пришлось смотреть концовку игры в тыртубе).
- Условия финала. Критически напоминает Слои, где были довольно четкие и временами сложноватые (если не обращаться к гайдам) особенности получения разных концовок. 
- Все же какое-то несоответствие заявленной теме. А где ведьма-то?.. Ну погоняли нас немного, да, покомандовал нами женский голос. Да только игра вышла про травму главного героя, а не про это вот все. Намешали, намешали...
- Ну не хоррор, нет. Не напугали ни разу. Атмосфера как-то не задалась - только хижина и то самое белое дерево.

[b]В итоге...[/b]
Не советую. Несмотря на крутые примочки, игра все равно чувствуется какой-то сырой, что ли. Не хватило и ведьмы, и героя, и всего. 6/10 за интересные механики.",

Besonders gefallen haben mir die Grafik, Musik und Sounds und natürlich Bullet, unser tierischer Gefährte. Zu Beginn des Spiel wirkt alles noch sehr harmlos, auch wenn diverse Konversationen unseres Protagonisten mit anderen Personen - wie Jess oder dem Sheriff - diskrete Hinweise darauf geben, was wir für ein Problem haben könnten. Und warum es keine gute Idee ist, bei der Suche nach dem vermissten Jungen zu helfen. Stück für Stück werden wir an die Thematik PTBS herangeführt und erfahren in Flashbacks mehr über Ellis Vergangenheit, während wir uns immer weiter im Wald verlieren.
Die Idee mit den realitätsverändernden Tapes gefiel mir an sich sehr gut. Die hätten ruhig noch öfter Anwendung im Spiel finden können.

Ein bisschen zu kurz gekommen ist generell die Story, die mit der Blair Witch zusammenhängt. Man trifft nur am Ende auf sie, sonst bekommt man hier und da Besuch von Wald- und Laubmonstern, die zugegebenermaßen auf Dauer eher lästig statt gruselig sind. Auch einzelne Abschnitte fühlten sich unendlich lang an [spoiler] - bspw. als wir Bullet durch die Schlucht tragen mussten, im vernebelten Wald den Monstern aus dem Weg gehen sollten oder so ziemlich der komplette letzte Abschnitt, der sich im Haus abspielte[/spoiler].
Je näher man dem Ende kam, umso repetitiver fühlte es sich an, was mich im letzten Kapitel einfach nur noch nervte.

Und so sehr ich es begrüße, Themen wie Angstzustände, PTBS und Suizid in Spielen zu behandeln, so fand ich die Flashbacks, die auf Ellis Militär- und Polizeidienst hinweisen, irgendwie sehr unpassend in diesem Genre. 

Zusammenfassend würde ich sagen, für Freunde des seichten Grusels mit Erkundungsdrang und Atmosphärenfans kann ich dieses Spiel empfehlen. Für alle, die auf harten Horror stehen und eher ungeduldige Spieler sind, nicht.",

Vento batendo nas oreia, cachorro latindo por que viu demonio, objeto caindo e não tem objeto, caminho sumindo, vozes e uma floresta que consegue prender e envolver o jogador mais acostumado com o terror. 
Como em Sillents hill teremos uma espécie de mundo alternativo, não tão amplo e nem tão complexo; pois esse mundo alternativo é a mente conturbada de nosso personagem Ellis; Ellis é um ex veterano de guerra que passou por muita atrocidades na guerra e para completar, teve uma tragédia em sua volta a vida normal. 

Nesse tempo que Ellis vê no desaparecimento de Peter a chance de retomar os dias de glória a sua vida, mais é ai que o inferno começa e sua jornada ira tomar um rumo sem volta. 

Bruxa de Blair o game é uma grata Surpresa do mundo do Horror, imagine você ver um game na E3 com data de lançamento e na data de lançamento ele lançar e ser bom, sem Alardes e sem complicação; anunciado e lançado. 
Da para ver que a Bloober team veio forte e não quis saber de brincadeira. 

O game é muito bem feito, são muitos detalhes valorizados e muita coisa levada em conta; exemplos que se destacam: 
_ Celular de Ellie- Podemos jogar o joguinho da Cobrinha ( antigo e clássico nos Nokia), ler SMS e fazer ligações. 
_ As arvores rangindo e barulho de mata é raro você ver repetido, parece que gravaram horas e horas o som da penumbra de alguma floresta, e isso aterroriza nos momentos que tem que andar pela mata. 
_ Forma do cachorro agir; ele rola pelo mapa e corre e fareja e age como um cão ( Diferente do game Call of duty ghosts que o cão é um tijolo móvel).

As referências ao filme foram bem feitas e colocadas em game, além da grande floresta; temos a casa da bruxa, a filmadora, lanterna e todo clima que os fãs dos filmes conheceram. 

Outro ponto destaque é a forma como a Linearidade do jogo ganha outra forma, é comum você se prender por que esta perdido na mata ou por que não encontro uma fita para assistir e saber o que fazer; e com isso você fica caminhando por longos tempos, não acontece daquelas paredes invisiveis te trancar, você simplismente não sabe para onde esta indo pois é uma floresta e ela pode ou não ter um fim naquela direção.

Bruxa de blair é um ótimo game de terror e com certeza merece ser jogado por fãs de terror !!
Nele não temos combate e a atmosfera vai fazer você tomar alguns sustos. 
Tem alguns bugs no jogo e isso tem em todos, mais aqui eles não merecem destaque pois não atrapalham a campanha e nem são tão relevantes assim.

In regards to atmosphere, Blair Witch nails the idea of being stuck in the middle of no where. The feeling of being lost in the woods seems pretty accurate. I can honestly say there was many times where I found myself saying: ""Where the fuck am I supposed to go?"" or ""What the fuck am I supposed to do now?"" The game also has a certain degree of creepiness. There is something about being isolated and wandering around in the pitch black dead of night with a crappy flashlight.

In terms of gameplay, this is where I think the game has its biggest flaws. The combat, for example, is fucking shit. It's like a crappy version of the flashlight mechanic from Alan Wake. The enemies bolt around really fast and you find yourself spinning in circles like a fucking asshole before they kill you. It sucks and I don't think that it really has any place in the game. It felt strange because I don't really like many ""walking simulators"", but I think that this game would have been much better without the enemies. They added barely anything to the experience. 

Overall, I'd say that the game is relatively decent (except for the final chapter which is a load of shit and goes on for way too long). It's not perfect, it does have certain sections that feel a little repetitive (for example, the section where you need to clear cut trees from the tracks), but I'd say that it's worth playing through for someone looking for a time waster.","Revising this to a thumbs up because I gave the game another shot.

The enemies bolt around really fast and you find yourself spinning in circles like a fucking asshole before they kill you. It sucks and I don't think that it really has any place in the game. It felt strange because I don't really like many ""walking simulators"", but I think that this game would have been much better without the enemies. They added barely anything to the experience. 

Overall, I'd say that the game is relatively decent (except for the final chapter which is a load of shit and goes on for way too long). It's not perfect, it does have certain sections that feel a little repetitive (for example, the section where you need to clear cut trees from the tracks), but I'd say that it's worth playing through for someone looking for a time waster."

I bought this game for 10$ CND which is what this 4-5 hour game should realistically cost. 

Now, I have never watched the Blair Witch movies and probably never will. I just know its about some kids doing a documentary on the woods or something, and weird shit happens and someone finds their tapes and that they went on to create a brand new genre of film or at least popularise it known as ""found footage"".  So I did not go into this as a biased Blair Witch fan.

So was I confused by the plot as someone who has never interacted with this franchise? Not at all, but only because the story is so predictable that any ""plot twists"" become obvious very early on. Basically you are a guy who has PTSD (horror character with mental issues? never heard that a billion times before), the whole game can be explained away as him having a mental breakdown.. even the supernatural stuff, random stuff happens cause.. mental disorder. So do not go into this expecting a mind blowing story. 

However, the game has really good production values, cant complain when it comes to graphics, sound or atmosphere. And what really peaked my interest about this game, is that you get a dog companion, which is as cute as it sounds, he follows you around, warns you of danger, leads you to places etc etc... that alone made the game for me. We haven't had a mechanic like this in a horror game since Rule of Rose and Haunting Grounds back in 2005ish. 

You also get a fully working retro cellphone which may make some of us older gamers a bit nostalgic lol ... you can even play snake on it!! 

Gameplay is okay I guess, its more of a walking sim than anything, puzzles are non existent, you sometimes have to look for an item or have to watch a video and pause it at the correct time, but its super obvious. The only frustrating part for me, was when I got stuck in a ""loop"" going in circles, one time for at least 10 minutes. But then I stopped and looked around for the item that I needed to pickup and I was fine, it had been my fault for not paying attention. Checkpoints are also very generous, spawning you a few steps away from where you died, so you don't pointlessly loose any progress. Not that this game has any difficulty....

I must say this game utterly fails as a horror game for me, there is like a single ""enemy"" you face the whole game which are these humanoid wooden people that kinda shake around a bit, but you can easily blast them with your flashlight Alan Wake style. And later on, the game just makes you not even look at them to pass by them, so your just staring at the floor lol
Aside from that, few jump scares, which as someone who plays a lot of horror games, I am kinda tired of by now. But I am sure someone who does not, may find random stuff jumping at you scary.

Gerekse hızlı işlenişini oyunun sonuna doğru durdurup boş sekanslarla zamanınızı harcaması olsun, gerekse atmosferini saçma bir şekilde değerlendirmesi olsun gerçekten boşa harcanmış bir potansiyel içeriyor Blair Witch. Ormanda kaybolan bir çocuğu aramakla görevlendirilmiş bir şerif grubunun eski üyesi olan Ellis, izni olmadan ormandaki araştırma grubuna katılıyor. Şerif ile geçmişi olduğu için bu durumu konuşarak hallediyor ve grubundan ayrı bir şekilde, köpeği Bullet ile çocuğu aramaya başlıyor. 

Hikayeden öğrendiğimize göre Ellis, bir hastalıkla boğuşuyor. Olmayan şeyleri görüyor, gerçeklik algısını çoğu zaman kaybediyor. İşte hikayenin geri kalanını batıracak özellik burada devreye giriyor. Ellis; çoğu zaman gerçeklik algısını kaybettiği için, mekanlar ve bölümler arasında anlamsız geçişler yapmaya başlıyorsunuz. Oyun bir yerden sonra mantıklı hiçbir açıklaması olmayan mekanları fiziksel olarak var ediyor ve yine mantıklı hiçbir açıklaması olmayan mekanları fiziksel olarak yok ediyor. Fakat sorun şu ki bu, atmosferi geliştirmek yerine sadece halihazırda bulunan hikayeyi karman çorman yapıyor. Bu tarz bir işleniş seçmesine rağmen oyunun sonu gayet beklendik oluyor. Her şeyin gerçek olduğunu ve hepsinin bir şekilde gerçekleştiğini görüyorsunuz. 

Kişisel olarak bölüm tasarımlarının çoğunun kötü olduğu belirtmem gerekse de birkaç bölüm tasarımının hoşuma gittiğini söylemem gerekiyor. Özellikle ''Oduncu'' bölümünün ses ve atmosfer tasarımını gayet beğendim. Keşke bu bütünlüğü bütün oyuna aktarıp oyunun hem oynanma süresini hem de işleniş süresini uzatsalardı.

Seneler önce çıkmış bir yapım olsa bile optimizasyonda çok ciddi sıkıntılara sahip. Genel olarak bir fps düşüşü yaşanmasa bile oyun, bilgisayarınızı ciddi anlamda ısıtıyor. Bu da uzun süreli oynanışta ciddi performans sıkıntılarına yol açabiliyor.

Genel olarak potansiyellerini harcadıklarını düşündüğüm için incelememi olumsuz yönde yapıyorum. Ayrıca oyunu almak isteyen arkadaşlara da indirimi beklemelerini tavsiye ediyorum.

Fed and pet the dog almost often, didn't leave bullet, didn't collect figurines anywhere except in the last chapter in order to open the door, didn't break any totems throughout the game, and neither flashed the light at the enemies behind the trees in the woods, nor did as the witch asked of me in the entire game, no killing anyone.

Quem veio pelo filme, só tenho que dizer que a melhor referência é a casa. No mais, ele tenta explicar um pouco o que houve no filme (mas como o filme não há nada concreto, fica na tua dedução). Mas sim, tem uma LEVE relação. Mas é outra coisa. 
Os inimigos e a imersão são o ponto bom desse game. Sim, é MUITO imersivo. Mas peca nos flashbacks chatos. 
Quem curtiu muito o filme, talvez se decepcione, mas como um jogo mesmo, é bom. 
Tem bugs... já aviso. E nem tudo é explicado, tem que ser intuitivo pela sua dedução.
E se quiser o final bom, PESQUISE o que tem que fazer, pois jogando por dedução vc não vai conseguir.

Parte do Spoiler de leve sobre o filme e pouco do game (mas bem pouco):
No filme vc não vê nada, o que deixa bom, e uma das teses das pessoas era que o Josh seria ""controlado"" e assim levando a Heather e o Mike pra serem mortos na casa.
O jogo não tem muitas referências neles infelizmente, mas ajuda nessa tese, visto que o ""vilão"" é controlado pela bruxa e ele quer cumprir o trabalho e passar a bola pro protagonista (o final bom e ruim tem a ver com isso). O resumo é: não espere muito sobre os 3 do filme. E sim no draminha chato do protagonista.",

With such a talent, they make such an indescribably stupid game.
And such long.
Absolutely empty walking, empty game.
And this genre is indefinitely stupid. 
There are no words what could be done and what they did. With the same meaning and originality.
The developers show psychos and human mistakes in the game, and they themselves make such an evil game. What do they give people? There is no any meaning, just walking in the dark and death 10 hours. In some places you have to go very slowly and have to replay. A very boring and empty ""game"". This game requires the eyes of an owl and the patience of an angel, that is, you pay for the torture. 
10 hours monotony and evil, all these hours running by pressing w shift in the dark, and at the end the stupidest ending. As if they laughed at the player. I am sorry for the money and time spent.
The slogan of the game - ""the worst combination: not only boring, but also horror."" Horror should be meaningful and interesting, interesting ideas, action-packed, balanced not annoying suspense plots and moral encouragement of the right qualities. otherwise it's just a first-person walking simulator in the dark. And darkness is not necessary at all, it only gets in the way and is annoying. Can you, a developer, walk in the dark in real life?? How is the game different? How long can you endure this?! Half an hour maximum. There is no witch, an explanation of where she is from, why, and something interesting, only a madman running through the woods with branches on the head and sick (he has post-traumatic injury according to the plot) fool with a dog who went to the forest alone like superman. It is clear that he will die there. It's stupid, funny and absurdity.
The most interesting thing is that in the beginning it seems that there will be a masterpiece because of the graphics, dog and mysticism with the camera.
At the end of the game, I looked like this nutcase with branches on the head. :)
I really love horror games and because of the game The Medium, I am very surprised that the other games from these developers are so empty and amateurish. 

Rise of the Tomb Raider has a cool witch, even though it's not even a horror game.

By the way, I played your game Layers of Fear. I liked the idea, but by the third hour I thought that I can not do it anymore, the same thing. You go, the door is closed, you turn, the door is open, etc. infinitely the same thing. You have to do something about the monotony and nonsense and meaninglessness in your games. And fill the plot with something smart, sane, useful. With interesting gameplay. In addition, the first person, in my opinion, is boring, this is the 90s. Better to do realistic control and movements view, convenient and comfortable. Realistic but fast, without delays etc. 

By the way, the character has a mobile phone, a Nokia from the early 2000s with games, there is a game called Snake. It is interesting. Why? Because you can see progress every second. The downside of the game is that you quickly lose and there is no point. Even from this game you can understand that your game is boring. 

The game is actually very easy to fix - cut the darkness and walking, especially in the cabin at the end, make a clear ending and a way to get it, and make navigation and fix a couple of puzzles. So that the game lasts about 4 hours. And it will become a first-person atmospheric horror game with great gameplay ideas somewhere around 7 out of 10, because there is a bit of a plot, it will be nice to play it at a discount and of course add a witch in a game about a witch, some kind of story about her and a reward for correct clear decisions. But the developers are asleep.. 

I always recommend buying games at a discount and, if possible, where you really buy it, and not rent while Steam exists or has not sent you to hell. Besides, there is no demo, you might not like the game, etc. And we play most games once, or not at all, why pay tens of dollars - nonsense. And if you play several times a week, you can get into debt within a month. Two hours of play or 14 days will pass and you won’t be able to return it. Plus, many games deceive the buyer, for example, on soulslike it says adventure or impossible to complete without paid modifications, on coop it doesn't say only coop in a franchise that had a single player campaign, or the game is just very boring hackwork with cool advertising or there is an agenda instead of a normal plot with normal characters, etc. The game is easy or well optimized for the first 2 hours, then problems start and you can't return the game. Reviews are bought by game companies. And you agree to some rules, a rule book, who reads that? When you buy food, do you also sign something? Food is even more serious. You write so much so that no one will notice that we have no rights to the goods we bought?! Creatures. Agreement to view some personal data, a microphone, etc., what is that? And if you don't agree, you can't play, it's violence. And how can we filter mixed content, block absolutely everything?? Make censored content, censored versions. So, this is not a kind store, but real thieves, you can’t be generous with them. Instead, they should be judged.","Rubbish.

Das einzige was mich im Spiel so weit gebracht hat war die Story die ohne eigentlich ziemlich langweilig ist aber sie war halt das einzige was den Spielfluss noch so zum laufen gebracht hat.

Im großen und ganzen ist das Spiel einfach langweilig und nicht das was man von einem Horror Spiel erhofft.

Before playing I knew that Blair Witch was a horror game involving you having a dog and you being a former cop. Didn`t know ANYTHING about the plot. The game takes some time to put you in the game`s mood and atmosphere. The forest you explore is really good looking and the game overall has some nice visuals. Also nice music (nothing memorable but its fine). For a horror game it felt a lot like an adventure game if I`m being honest, not that this is a bad thing. Game wasn`t THAT scary IMO but had some good scares.
Worth checking this out!

Когда-то давно так поступили ребята из Terminal Reality, собрав свою ""Ведьму из Блэр"" на базе игры ""Nocturne"". Получилось немного спорно, но интересно. У игры был и свой колорит, и сюжетные аллюзии на оригинальную историю.

Здесь, соответственно, тоже ждёшь какой-то идейной преемственности. Но, получается, ждёшь зря. В игре нет целостной идеи и хорошей связи со своими кинематографическими предшественниками. А то, что есть, смотрится очень вторично: где-то слышно эхо Alan Wake, лейтмотив истории сильно напоминает ""Jacob's Ladder""... В результате получилось такое одеяло из лоскутков, надёрганных без какого-то бережного отношения, и грубо сшитых меж собой.

В общем, эта игра не о ""Ведьме из Блэр"". Она просто так называется. Чтобы ребята вроде меня, до сих пор болеющие сюжетом кино, купили это. Но за названием - ни интересного геймплея, ни хорошей истории, ни даже вкуса ностальгии. Увы.


P.S. Да, чел в ПТСР, потерянный в лесу среди своих кошмаров, и удерживаемый от безумия только присутствием своего друга-пёселя - на этом можно построить неплохой драматический хоррор.

Bloober Team is known for their story-rich, unique horror games that are meant to terrify you in many unconventional ways. To me, it seems like they tried to launch a more conventional survival horror game and stepped out of their craftsmanship. Blair Witch isn’t groundbreaking in its execution or idea but it definitely has potential. The truth is that the entirety of this game isn’t as great as it seems, just like the reviews say - and I started it with high hopes. But it doesn't deserve all the hate either because the more you play, the better it gets. The price could be a couple of euros lower to match its quality better but I understand that developing games is costly. 

Blair Witch introduces some nice mechanics such as the walkie-talkie and the multipurpose camera, the story is on point and the forest feels unwelcoming as intended. Plus, Bullet is such a lovely dog! Some of the game’s weaknesses can be forgiven because of a few genuinely creepy moments and the mind-blowing way it deals with mental illnesses. The encounters with the monsters are adrenaline-pumping since you must either defend yourself with your flashlight or evade them. 

But overall, is it that scary? Maybe not. Personally, I expected a bit more. Is it worth playing? Depends on your preference; some people might find this bland, others can be scared mindless. It’s hard to tell unless you try! I enjoyed it.

- I'd advice you to spend your money on something else... It's mediocre at best. Perhaps worth 10 euros, as long as you don't crash every 15 minuttes like me ofc.

This game ran fine for the first 40 minuttes or so, then it started crashing randomly. The auto save function is far inbetween progress in the game, so I've just had to replay the same 15 minuttes of gameplay 3 times, cause it isnt possible to manually save? - Just why???
I usually dont have games crashing on me, so I think there's something wrong with this product. So far storywise it seems pretty mediocre.

Crashing aside, if the game was actually interesting storywise, or with good gameplay mechanics, I'd probably bother to look further into whats causing my crashes, but honestly, I can't be arsed, cause it doesn't feel like a good game overall.

The idea of having a companion is alright, though it does feel clunky at time ordering your dog around. Besides that, your interaction will the dog have those awkward animation moments, where both of you just stares at eachother. It's the same 3 ""petting"" animation and the interactions, while feeling ""cool"" at the beginning, gets old pretty quickly.

I wonder how much they paid to get those scores. - This game is nowhere near a top quality game.

It might ahve more scary moments later on, but I've encountered what the game calls combat, and seen some of the ""creatures"" or ""creature"" that lurks in the forest, and to be frank, it wasn't really scary, nor did it feel intense at all.","TLDR;

I was really in two minds whether to recommend this game or not, since I couldn't enjoy the gameplay that much. Being in the middle of a forest, chasing a dog who barely follows my orders...well, that can be frustrating. 

Moreover, most part of items that can be collected just doesn't bring anything to the gameplay, with the nice exception of video tapes. Fightings are also not particularly well designed.

Technically I could enjoy the graphics and sound effects. I unfortunately experienced a game crash, but that was the only one so far and did't impact on the game experience that much.

Moving forward through the chapters, I started really loving the atmosphere. Although the game has important differences from the films (main character's flashbacks, the dog, no human mates, everything starts like a rescue mission), it still makes to reproduce that atmosphere of being lost in a evil, dark forest, in which time and space are not the same any more and our worst nightmares come true. To me and probably to every fan of those films, this alone makes this game worth a buy. 

Still, Blair Witch is far from being a masterpiece of the genre and I wouldn't recommend it to everyone unconditionally. In order to enjoy the game, one has to really want to experience everything that is typical of the movies. Being lost in the forest in which evil can be felt more than really seen, without having a clue of what doing next: that's what you can expect from this game. If you want to try this experience, go for the it. Even in this case, you may want to look for a decent discount, since longevity doesn't sound like a strenght of Blair Witch.

If you look for action, powerful weapons, fightings you'd better search somewhere else. Also don't expect an open world game.

- не очень интересные задания и схватки с врагами.
- только ленивый по моему не брал за основу сюжет с душевной травмой и ее последствиями
- звук неплохой, атмосферу дает норм

Ужасы/шагалка от авторов очень оригинальных игр данного жанра. И ещё когда они только объявили о разработке этой игры меня стали терзать смутные непонятки. Это мягко говоря так себе выбор для сеттинга, лучше бы уж что-то своё придумали, могут же.
В результате мы играем за не сильно успешного мужика с собакой и кучей психологических проблем вплоть до столь любимых разработчиками глюков.
И первое от чего я натурально офигел это когда моя RGB-клавиатура внезапно стала жить своей жизнью. То заморгает когда в игре глючит фонарик, то краснеет когда героя хватает монстр, а то и натурально показывает символ игры во время загрузки. Ранее с таким приёмом я не встречался и это очень атмосферно. Особенно в первый раз, гы. :))
Ну а дальше я офигел когда попытался поставить разрешение 2к и увидел фпс. Еле вытягивало на 60 (на видюхе 2080, которая Ведьмака 3 тянула на 80 фпс, в 2к) и даже эти 60 были какими-то дёрганными. На стандартных 1080р игралось нормально (хотя просадки местами были), но, блин, это просто верх дна оптимизации.
Выглядит игра хорошо, местами даже отлично, но слишком часто любит выключить свет прям вообще, а в финале скалы и просто дом с глюками. Но в начале лес очень красивый.
Слишком дофига собираемых предметов, что банально отвлекает от игры, причём собрать всё за одно прохождение невозможно ибо тут две концовки и для хорошей нужно кой-чего не трогать (что для манчкина вообще ересь). Впрочем, я старался получить хорошую, но всё равно получил плохую. Ну... лан.
История вроде и неплоха, но... она так себе, не вызывает никаких особых эмоций.
Итого ворох технических проблем, местами откровенно раздражающий игровой процесс и желание пройти это наконец и забыть нафик. Очень неожиданно для данной студии.

1. Главный минус руинящий все - посредственный геймдизайн. Добро пожаловать в коридорный лес, который всеми силами пытается выглядеть настоящим, но требует от игрока четкого, шаг в шаг, похода по хлебным крошкам. Не видишь хлебных крошек - застрянешь в чистилище из спецэффектов и скримеров явно дольше, чем того планировал режиссер, расставивший экшенновую музыку и светящий в глаза вспышками, намекая что момент не должен тянутся дольше пары минут, но ты не можешь найти ""хлебную крошку"" и сегмент не заканчивается. Такое происходит периодически в разные моменты игры. Это было со мной, это было со стримерами, это будет и с тобой, если ты играешь впервые.
На НГ+, зная что от тебя хочет игра все выглядит бодрее, пока ты помнишь, что именно нужно делать.
2. Коридорный лес не поощряет исследование. Более того, для условной ""хорошей концовки"" требуется вообще не смотреть по сторонам и не трогать лишнего.
3. Креативные моменты в подаче истории и загадки чередуются выпрыгивающими в лицо монстрами и световыми эффектами. И конечно же стелсом в темноте с противниками стоящими на месте! Хорошо, что моментов где нужно, бежать, но не прятаться, от ебак почти нет.
4. Посредственная оптимизация. Мне всего то нужно скромные 60 фпс в фуллхд, но на своей 1060 со стареньким i5 я их не получил. Иногда можно застрять в объектах, если повернуть не туда или не угадать чего хочет от тебя режиссер.
5. Собака клевая, но интеракция с ней ни на что не влияет, кроме 5 секунд концовки. Обещали, что ее чуть ли не дрессировать можно будет - этого нет, возможно потому, что игра слишком коридорная для этого.
6. Саундтрек в версии с саундтреком в .wav формате. Обычно ожидаешь .flac для господ слушающих тишину в паузах между сегментами или пережатый плебейский .mp3. Часто при покупке игрового саундтрека находишь версию в обоих форматах. Ок, пришлось потратить время на конвертацию, потому что мой легендарный плеер не может в .wav

Из приятных моментов: история в целом интересная, хоть и предсказуемая. Есть приятные моменты и загадки. Пес милый и его можно кастомизировать: цвет шерсти, глаз, ошейника. Даешь селекцию псов в массы!
Сама ведьма шепчет тебе на ухо всякое, что прикольно. 
Немного раскрыта тема болотных механизмов, хотя хотелось бы больше. Вообще, с художественной частью у игры все в порядке. Графика так себе, но дизайн вид имеет и музыка хороша.

На самом деле начинал играть Blair Witch на xbox - не зная правил умудрялся падать за край карты и момент [spoiler] когда подбираешь каску и должен бежать прячась от пуль и прожекторов в военном флешбеке [/spoiler] оказался не проходим. Я минут 40 умирал раз за разом в одном и том же месте. На пк этот момент выглядит скриптовым и проходится минуты за 3 с первого раза. В пк версии все еще случалась застревать в объектах, но за карту не проваливался, хотя и лес исследовать не пытался, как делал это на консоле.

Предыдущие ходячие симуляторы Блубер на самом деле имели те же проблемы, но за счет замкнутых пространств и коридоров возможности потеряться в догадках чего от тебя прямо сейчас хочет режиссер или, ни дай богиня, упасть за карту было меньше.
В итоге разочарования и усталости игра дает больше, чем приятных впечатлений.",

My only downsides would be that the section in the house kinda overstays its welcome, and stumbling around an unreliably laid-out dark forest, trying to figure out the next bit of literal magic that'll make the plot advance, can be a little frustrating.

Some parts of this game - specifically more towards the end - were rather tedious, something that could be exaggerated partly by the not-so-sprint sprint mechanic (a feature in a lot of horror games, so while inconvenient, i can semi-pass it on that). 
The plot also became rather predictable by the end, and veered away from its initial opening; finding missing boy Peter Shannon. It instead turns into a character development/backstory exploration, and the objective of finding the boy gets ""pushed"" to the back of the ""mind"" of the storyline and becomes basically irrelevant.

Much of the horror aspects of the game relied on jumpscares, and although ""atmospheric"", this more or less worked to make those scares more viable. Of course, if you're content with jumpscares as a part of your main horror ""fix"", then there should be no problem here.

However, that being said, the overall plot was interesting, despite pushing one of its main elements to the back. The growth and change of Ellis is interesting to watch, as is the depth into his backstory that makes him a viable ""target"" for the subject of horrors within the forest.

I'd also say the studio did quite well with what they were given, and though I don't consider only relying on jumpscares as scary, or ""proper"" horror, the Blair Witch movies have been little more than that, and I can imagine it would be hard to build proper atmospheric horror off a franchise that itself relies on cheap scares. For example; Never seeing the ""Blair Witch"".
In my opinion, they have done quite well at creating their own spin from the main franchise, with what they could and without intruding too far into the ""canon"" set by the movies. As of course, I can imagine that people would be quite bored with a game that directly follows the suit of the movies themselves. 

The game itself stayed as true as it could to its film predecessors, while managing a game that, unlike the former, only had one main protagonist compared to the average ""teens in the wood"" trope the film set, where many of the ""scares"" there played off of interactions between them. This, as such, created a fleshed out villain to provide for an interesting antagonist to avoid creating a game that simply involved walking around the woods getting scared by the unseeable paranormal being in the woods.
And, of course.. It lets you pat the dog.

tl;dr, the studio worked with what it could to try to create an intriguing, unique game, while trying to keep the format of its predecessors.

Современного игрока и зрителя, к сожалению, тяжело удивить, а точнее испугать чем-либо, особенно искушенного игрока. Жанр [b] хоррора [/b] почти полностью ушёл, и сейчас многие стараются комбинировать жанры, чтобы создать хоть что-то интересное, если не страшное, взять тот же [i] ""Оно"" [/i], может не самый лучший пример с точки зрения качества, однако показательный. Как правило хоррор идет бок о бок с таким жанром как триллер. Тут почти также, сами разработчики позиционируют игру как сюжетный психологический хоррор. Давайте с этим разберемся.
Про хоррор поговорили, поговорим о психологическом. Тут скорее очень хорошо работает давящая [b] атмосфера[/b], её грамотно выстроили за счет картинки, музыки и переживания главного героя. Её не рушат (как делают некоторые разработчики) и она работает.  О [b] сюжете [/b] сказать особо нечего, он очевидный. Эллис достаточно поверхностный, хоть мотивация его и ясна. Ближе к середине начинаешь догадываться к чему все идет, а как появляется Карвер концовка становится слишком очевидной. И как бы не пытались сделать сюжет интересным, меня он почти не интересовал в ходе игры. Игру также нельзя назвать совсем вторичной  c точки зрения [b] геймплея [/b], так как тут есть геймплейные новшества  в виде собаки (Буллета) и камера со своеобразным управлением временем, но такими вещами как та же камера с режимом ночного видения (правда он используется в основном в конце) она походит на outlast, а фонарик который главный герой использует как оружие явно напоминает об Alan Wake. Хотя ничего ужасного в этом и нет, однако это вторично. Сам же геймплей в основном представляет собой ходьбу, очень мало решений каких-то реально интересных головоломок, только рельсы и дрезина запомнились. Кстати о фонарике, по сути единственные [b] попытки сражений [/b] будут связаны с ним и на мой взгляд сделано это достаточно... убого. Потому что ты просто стоишь как дурак, крутишься на месте, и 5 раз поражаешь ""тень"" светом. Естественно эту тень не разглядишь, но тебе помогает Буллет, он смотрит в сторону противника и злобно рычит, всю комичность ситуации придает то, что тень передвигается неимоверно быстро и Буллет крутится на 360 градусов посекундно меняя направление взгляда, и ты крутишься вместе с ним.
У игры к сожалению есть [b] некоторые проблемы с технической стороны[/b], с которыми мне, к несчастью, пришлось столкнуться. Ну для начала это [b] анимации[/b], они сделаны очень слабо, и трудно верить в происходящие, когда пёс передвигается так, как передвигается в этой игре... [b] Баги [/b] также присутствуют, раза 3 или 4 я застревал в текстурах. И, забавно что ли, что в игре есть [b] автосохранения[/b], но они или не работают вообще, или не работают на 17-ой главе, по мере прохождения игра сама сохраняет прогресс (появляется соответствующий значок в правом нижнем углу) и, естественно, как все нормальные люди, сразу после автосохранения я сохраняюсь вручную.  Так вот на половине 17-ой главы я сохранился и вышел, потом запустил игру, и почему-то меня бросило на начало главы, причем не важно ручной сейв я запускал или автосейв, я все равно оказывался в начале главы.
Теперь спойлер, я предупреждаю! [spoiler] В игре несколько концовок, по-моему, 4 и они зависят естественно от проделанных или не проделанных действий, звонил ли ты девушке, обнимал ли пса и так далее, и к этому претензий нет. Претензии опять к 17-ой главе, в ней вы наткнетесь на шерифа который будет сидеть у кровати, и у вас будет возможность с ним взаимодействовать, и взаимодействовав с ним, вы его убьете, так же чуть позже в главе вы сможете взаимодействовать с плотиной на лесопилке и тоже кого-то убьёт. Внимание вопрос: а как я должен понять, что за взаимодействием стоит именно убийство, тем более за взаимодействие с плотиной, я вот например думал, что взаимодействуя, я наоборот спасаю шерифа, нет ни одной предпосылки, что за взаимодействием окажется именно убийство. Вы скажете, ты дурак? По тону игры не понимаешь что ли? Тем более сам говорил, что понял к чему все идёт, и в этом будет толика истины, но все равно,  это последняя глава, и я могу думать, что это мой шанс все исправить. В общем я не совсем это понимаю. В том же [i] Metro [/i] это реализовано куда лучше на мой взгляд, убил невиновного - плохо, убил кого-то кого можно пощадить - плохо, дал патрон маленькому мальчику- хорошо. В [i] Metro [/i] все логично и я знаю что стоит за взаимодействие с мальчиком, который просит патрон. [/spoiler]

[b] Все аспекты игры [/b] лавируют между оценками ниже среднего, средне и чуть выше среднего. Атмосфера тут я бы даже сказал хорошая, не страшная, но гнетущая. Сюжет крайне посредственный, геймплей за исключением пары фишек тоже. Техническая сторона также оставляет желать лучшего. Подводя итог можно сказать, что игра заслуживает оценку 5 ведьмкоторыхдаженепоказали/10.

Overall, the story isn't a bad one, with the main character (Ellis) dealing with personal tragedy, feelings of guilt, and serious, unresolved PTSD - said PTSD being a result of previous stints in both the military and police.  Ellis' mental stability is pushed to its limits when he enters the forest to find a missing boy by the name of Peter Shannon.  

For the most part, this game is a walking simulator and there is no combat to speak of.  You do use your flashlight to ward off ""witches"" etc, but other than that, it's walking/running, picking up trinkets and clues and moving forward from there.  You are paired with your trusty companion dog named Bullet.  You can give Bullet basic commands too, like ""heel"" or ""seek;""  the latter option sometimes allows Bullet to pick up a scent and lead you in the right direction.  For the most part, these elements works nicely and are a joy to play.  

You are also expected to solve puzzles, which - for the most part - are straight forward, but can occasionally become frustrating or tedious as it's not always clear where to go; and because you're in the forest and can cover a lot of ground, frustration can set in while you aimlessly wander around.  On two occasions, I had to Google the game to figure out how to proceed, as I was sick of wasting time.  

Perhaps more problematic for me is the end of this game; not necessarily how the story ends, but how it unfolds.  Sure, there are some decent jump scares, but for the last 1-2 hours, you're covering the same ground time and time again, while doing the same things over and over again.  Needless to say, it just became repetitive and wore out its welcome.  

In the end, if you are a big horror fan and like story driven, borderline walking simulators, you should check this game out - especially if you can get it for 20 bucks or less.  For me, it took me about 8 hours to beat.  I'd say, for about 60-70% of that time, I was mostly engaged and curious about the story and where it would lead.  Couple that with the solid graphics and a creepy atmosphere, and you have yourself a decent horror game.  Just keep your expectations in check.","Good graphics - quite atmospheric.

Ты уже в середине игры спокойно можешь догадаться, что к чему в сюжетном повествовании и чем игра кончится. Но игра будто насильно начинает разжевывать все в последней главе, растягивая до абсолютной духоты повествование. Чтоб вы поняли - каждая глава в игре проходится минут за 15. Последняя глава заняла около часа. Час ох**тельного геймплея про облизывание углов корридоров, Карл! 
И потом эта же концовка добивает тебя тем, что, оказывается, ты все делал далеко не правильно, игра проходится совершенно по-другому, хоть тебе прямо и говорили, что делать. Держи плохую концовку. 
ЧЕГО?! Это как-то можно было адекватно реализовать, предоставляя выбор игроку, но нет же, лезь, бл*дь, в интернет, читай гайды ""Как получить хорошую концовку"" и охреневай. Еще внимание обратил на сцену, где !ОСТОРОЖНО СПОЙЛЕР! [spoiler] Эллис выбрасывает пистолет, из которого Карвер приказал ему убить Буллета. Серьезно? Ты идиот? Ты просто так выбросил, мать его, пистолет? Окей.... [/spoiler] Весьма тупо, но ладно, не критично.
Но, в целом, игра порадовала хорошей атмосферой и интересными геймплейными фишками. Довольно живой (как бы не было иронично) лес, тесное взаимодействие с пёселем, боевой стиль Алана Вейка... Но все таки чувствуются недоделки и дух инди-проекта. Особенно невидимые, мать их, стены. Они повсюду.
И что по итогу, игра на самом деле заслуживает внимания. Среди остального большинства блёклых хоррор-поделок, Blair Witch удалось приковать к себе внимание и занять свое место в памяти игроков.

Разрабы уебаны, ой. 
Поговорим о достаточно нашумевшем хорроре, данная игра мне понравилась. Но то как ее восхоляют это кнш нечто, она не соответсвует многим обзорам, ну прям вщ. Очень многие пишут мол: ЭТО САМЫЙ ЛУЧШИЙ ХОРРОР ААААААА! Хех, нет скажу я вам, с аутластом и рядом не стоит, но все же игра впечатляет моментами. 
Вы додик (детектив) у которого с бошкой не в порядке, у него есть своя собачка по имени Буллет. Сразу скажу что именно эта собака будет вам выносить мозг в плане психики, то есть вам будет страшно за нее если что вдруг, это человеческая психика, нам жаль животных.
□■□■Ну а щас о сюжете [СПОЙЛЕРЫ]□■□■
[spoiler] Как ранее я говорил мы детектив с отклонениями, нас так потрепала жизнь что многие были бы такими (Война, по игре поймёте). Мы ходим бродим в лесу в поисках Питера, его увел маньяк Кавер. Кавер это марионетка ведьмы, который использует НАС для того чтобы давать нам задания, выполнив их мы его освободим. Я ушел давольно далеко по сюжету т.к не хочу затрагивать всю эту шарманку с дрезиной, монстрами, лесопилкой и прочим. Перейду сразу к концу, к дому ВЕДЬМЫ, где она будет убивать вас, ыхых, будет вас просто мотивировать делать ее задания. Она хочет вас, вы будете ее 100% потому что каждый кто проходит игру 1 раз, все пройдут на плохую концовку, ВСЕ БЕЗ ИСКЛЮЧЕНИЯ!!!! P.s мне лень проходить 2 раз игру на хорошую. 
□■□■□■Концовка□■□■□■
Всего 4 концовки, 2 плохие , 2 хорошие, но опять же повторю вы 100% пройдете/прошли на плохую))) Конец говорит о многом, самое важное из конца то, что вы НОВАЯ марионетка ВЕДЬМЫ, убив Кавера, вы сами им станете/стали. Ну поговорим о хорошей концовки - ЧТО ДЛЯ ЭТОГО НУЖНО? Вам необходимо не убивать монстров фонарем, берите просто камеру и все. Не уничтожайте тотемы, не ломайте палки, крч не трогайте проклятую залупу, почему? Все просто, это грехи которые вы же и выполняете, вам приказывает Ведьма, а вы ее условно слушаете. 
Крч игра га#но но я ее посоветую все же, хороший хоррор, ну вот с концовкой уроды. Такие игры я ненавижу, когда от тебя зависит концовка, но ты не знаешь условий изначально, сосЫ пиХу играй 2 раз, и то если не лохонешься с залупой проклятой.  [/spoiler]

It's a good horror game no doubt, the graphics are great and they do well in placing you in what feels like realistic forest environments. Of course, this adds to the scare factor, as a lot of the horror comes from the tense atmosphere of navigating the eerie and low-lighted Black Hills Forest. Anyone with Xylophobia would definitely find this game terrifying and would do well to avoid it. Or maybe they'd want to play it even more. You do you.

The game is also as much a story about psychological trauma and terror as it is about actual horror, exploring the depths of PTSD and the consequences of your actions (which include pushing away those around you). Expect a lot of hallucinations and trippy sections regarding these mental issues faced by the protagonist. 

The gameplay is also pretty interesting and unique at times, with some creative mechanics dealing with the video recorder we find early in the game. Some parts of the game become very scary as a result of it. 

Unfortunately my ambivalence stems from the final act of the game but I won't delve into that. It's hard to explain but part of how I evaluate every media I experience is whether or not I feel like I appreciate the amount of time I have used for it, and whether I have received value for having consumed it. I'm not sure if I can say that for this game, but I definitely appreciate what the developers were going for. It is by no means a bad game, as the horror and gameplay aspects are very solid.

Zu Beginn des Spiels fährt man mit seinem Hund zu einem Waldgebiet, in dem auch die beiden Filme spielen. Dort beteiligt man sich an der Suche nach einem vermisten Jungen. Die Polizei ist schon im Wald und man folgt ihnen allein mit seinem vierbeinigen Begleiter. Die Geschichte des Charakters erfährt man erst Nach und Nach durch Telefonate, Gespräche über das Funkgerät mit den anderen Mitgliedern des Suchtrupps und Visionen, die im Laufe des Spiels immer abgedrehter werden. Mehr möchte ich aus Spoiler Gründen an dieser Stelle nicht verraten.

[h1] Gameplay : [/h1]
Ich würde es als Horror Walking Simulator bezeichnen. Bedrohliche Wesen kann man zum Teil mit der Taschenlampe vertreiben, aber auch nicht alle und auch nicht immer. Es ähnelt z.B. ""Layers of Fear"" oder ""Outlast"". 

Dabei ist der Wald der größte Schauplatz. Man kann sich im Wald zwar frei bewegen, aber die Wege sind sehr stark begrenzt. Man merkt das man sehr schnell durch Unterholz oder kleine Erhöhungen, die man nicht überwinden kann aufgehalten wird. Das ist meiner Meinung nach aber auch nötig, da man dadurch einige gruselige Überraschungen einbauen kann, die bei einer freien Bewegung nur sehr schwer zu realisieren wären. Der relativ feste Weg ermöglicht halt intensivere Effekte. 

Ist das Spiel zu Anfang noch etwas altbacken und träge, wird der Wald und die Ereignisse um einen herum im Laufe des Spiels immer abgedrehter und intensiver. Es gibt einige sehr tolle Ideen und gruselige Effekte. Welche genau das sind möchte ich aus Spoiler Gründen aber ebenfalls nicht verraten.

[h1] Grafik und Sound: [/h1]
Die Grafik wirkt teilweise etwas veraltet, ist aber noch völlig OK. Gerade der Wald wurde sehr gut in Szene gesetzt. Ist er zu Anfang noch einigermaßen Idyllisch, wird er im Laufe des Spiels immer düsterer, dunkler, verstörender und ihr werdet es selber sehen, was noch alles daraus wird. 

Der Sound wurde speziell für Kopfhörer entwickelt und es macht schon Laune wenn man nur mit dem Lichtkegel der Taschenlampe durch die Finsternis wandert und das Knacken des Unterholzes glasklar ertönt und einem vorgaukelt, das sich etwas in den Schatten bewegt.

[h1] Fazit: [/h1]
Mir hat ""Blair Witch"" als Spiel sehr viel besser gefallen, als die Filme. Kein überragendes Spiel, aber für mich als Horror Fan sehr gute Unterhaltung. Die Entwickler haben ein paar tolle Grusel Effekte und Ideen eingebaut, die einen gerade in der letzten Hälfte des Spiels immer wieder überraschen. 

Vorrausgesetzt man lässt sich darauf ein. Wenn ich so ein Spiel in einem hellen Raum mit mehreren Leuten und entsprechender Geräuschkulisse spiele wirkt es einfach nicht und die Atmosphäre ist zerstört. 

Es gibt aber auch etwas Kritik. Das Spiel ist relativ kurz. Ich habe für einen Durchgang knapp 7 Stunden gebraucht. Da es aber noch ein weiteres Ende gibt und auch den ein oder anderen Erfolg, werde ich es noch einmal durchspielen. Ich denke wer alle Enden sehen möchte und alle Erfolge sammelt ist etwa 10 bis 15 Stunden beschäftigt. Ich persönlich bin auch mal froh wenn ich keine 200 Stunden in ein Spiel versenken muss und mag auch mal, dank Zeitmangel, die kleine Unterhaltung zwischendurch. Für den Ein oder Anderen mag das aber zu wenig sein. 

Auch muss ich sagen, das trotz der knappen Spielzeit manche Schauplätze und Ereignisse etwas in die Länge gezogen sind.

Trotzdem ganz klar von mir eine Empfehlung. Wenn euch das Review gefallen hat würde ich mich über eine positive Bewertung freuen.

Amplify that with creaking trees, gnarled branches clawing at the sky, and a lanky towering witch constantly stalking its prey.

Watched some reviews about the game and the reception honestly didn't seem very favorable. After my dive into the game, I've come to a couple of conclusions that seem a bit fairer...I think. Condensed down this takes place two years after the filming of the first movie. You follow Ellis in his search for a 9-year-old boy that goes missing.  All the main elements that made up the witch are left completely intact with basically no changes as much as I could tell. As your search continues further into the woods strange anomalies begin to happen. This was the beginning of my favorite part which was the world constantly shifting around on itself. While typical the world moves around trapping you in the indefinite loop you'll receive these tapes. These videos are hints/puzzles that are a wonderful joy to figure and unpack. A side note and this just might be me the dog overall didn't feel too helpful instead it tends to feel scripted more than anything. It's not a bad thing but with the explanation of how the dog is supposed to work, it doesn't happen that way. The majority of my experiences tended to be just walking and Bullet would randomly find items without my intervention. Still, I have to admit the dog is a great addition later on when defending and leading you through the woods. Another part I found to be enjoyable had to be the imagery and visuals. Blooper tends to hit all the right notes when it comes to this for me. The Blair Witch would show Ellis something he deeply fears and makes into reality. All of this was done seamlessly and tastefully without pulling you out of the immersion. Granted the walking aspect got a bit tiresome around the 5th hour but the ending sequence does a great job picking up. The Blair Witch I felt was a great addition to the series overall honestly edging out everything except the original movie at least for me.

As your search continues further into the woods strange anomalies begin to happen. This was the beginning of my favorite part which was the world constantly shifting around on itself. While typical the world moves around trapping you in the indefinite loop you'll receive these tapes. These videos are hints/puzzles that are a wonderful joy to figure and unpack. A side note and this just might be me the dog overall didn't feel too helpful instead it tends to feel scripted more than anything. It's not a bad thing but with the explanation of how the dog is supposed to work, it doesn't happen that way. The majority of my experiences tended to be just walking and Bullet would randomly find items without my intervention. Still, I have to admit the dog is a great addition later on when defending and leading you through the woods. Another part I found to be enjoyable had to be the imagery and visuals. Blooper tends to hit all the right notes when it comes to this for me. The Blair Witch would show Ellis something he deeply fears and makes into reality. All of this was done seamlessly and tastefully without pulling you out of the immersion. Granted the walking aspect got a bit tiresome around the 5th hour but the ending sequence does a great job picking up. The Blair Witch I felt was a great addition to the series overall honestly edging out everything except the original movie at least for me. Please check this game out and Blooper their way of storytelling feels unique and well crafted from every game I've played from them.  82/100"

The Blair Witch game is a psychological and teemingly atmospheric horror game that has many similarities to the found-footage movie series but doesn't really follow the canonical plot. You wander through the Black Hills forest as part of a search effort for a 9 year old boy named Peter Shannon, and you do this mainly guided by your Belgian Malinois dog who's name happens to be Bullet (you can also customize him in the beginning). Despite this, the story seems to focus more and more on the main character Ellis' past, and less on the young boy you're looking for and the Blair Witch in general...

You navigate through the dark woods equipped with a camera recorder that lets you manipulate reality, a low quality flashlight, an old Nokia phone that you can play games on and call people with, and a walkie-talkie that you stole, all while fighting off stick monsters and being lead on by your dog. The game's progression relies on puzzles about changing the environment itself with the cam recorder and finding things in a spooky forest where you can easily get lost and fall into seemingly endless loops. My experience involved streaming to my friends and speaking to them vocally, but I think if I had played alone I would've developed more feelings of anxiety and fear. 

My playthrough also ended because the entire game is a buggy mess littered with game breaking glitches and horrible artificial intelligence. The game is supposed to be about six hours long, but mine was cut short because Bullet refused to go into the small hole and grab what I needed so I could progress onwards during my trek at the decrepit mining camp level. I really wanted to give this game a good review if I were able to finally get Bullet to do what I wanted, but I was never able to continue without restarting from the beginning. I unfortunately just cannot recommend this game in good faith. Along with everything else I've said, about the only ""collectibles"" are small wooden idols that you sometimes find, literal garbage, and Peter's belongings. [spoiler] The story almost entirely relies on how you treat your dog and whether you kill the stick monsters and break sticks (which scare the dog but can give you a bad ending; which is nonsensical). [/spoiler] It is objectively repetitive in its puzzle mechanics & the frustration devolves into boredom, eliminating any real fear you had while playing. 

Regardless of all of its faults, I'd say that the graphics are pretty nice, and the unnerving/haunting atmosphere is probably the game's best quality; that is if you can get past the increasing lack of enthusiasm as you play. If you want this game, I suggest buying it discounted because the $30 price tag just isn't really sensible considering how poorly optimized and short this game is. They really could've done something better with this IP and kind of came up short...

86349645,german,2021.01.10 21:48,✅,❌,0.5519817472,3,"Ich würde das Spiel für einen sehr viel geringeren Preis empfehlen, wenn er im Sale ist für 10-15 Euro. 

Pro:
- Das Spiel hat tolle Elemente, die ich in keinem anderen Horrorspiel selbst bisher erlebt habe. Dass man jederzeit auf seinem Handy die verschiedenen Nummern anwählen kann, selbst so winzige Details wie Handyspiele (Snake z.b.) spielen zu können, oder den Pizzalieferanten anrufen zu können.. Ist zwar nicht sehr wichtig so ein Krimskrams, fand ich aber trotzdem toll :) 
- Die Tapes die man finden kann, und mit denen man die Realität vor sich verändert, indem man an die richtige Stelle spult und stoppt, finde ich, sind ein tolles Element.
- Der Hund, Bullet, macht einen Großteil der Atmosphäre aus. Ohne ihn hätte das Spiel so m.M.n. nicht funktioniert. Die Sorge um den vierbeinigen Freund, seine Ängste und seine Unterstützung machen schon sehr viel Atmo aus.
- Auch wenn das Spiel meines Empfindens nach nicht gruselig ist, ist das Szenario im Wald nach einem Kind zu suchen und sich plötzlich unbeschreiblichen Gestalten gegenüber zu sehen und sich an sein Licht (und seinen Hund) klammern zu müssen schon teilweise recht spannend. 
- Die Story ist nicht bahnbrechend und neu, einzelne Aspekte sind berechenbar, aber alles in Einem schön schlüssig. [spoiler] Was ich hier besonders schön nachzuempfinden fand war die Darstellung einer posttraumatischen Belastungsstörung wie sie im Buche steht; mir wurde bereits nach dem ersten Anfall von Panik klar, dass es sich um eine handeln wird. [/spoiler] 

Contra:
- Das Spiel gaukelt einem mit verschiedenen Enden vor, dass es sich um ein Spiel mit freien Entscheidungen handelt, doch wird kaum einer (es sei denn er spoilert sich im Vorfeld) wirklich auf die zig Umstände kommen, die dazu führen, dass man ein gutes Ende bekommt. Es ist quasi vorgeschrieben, dass man es mehrmals spielen muss und mit allerhöchster Wahrscheinlichkeit das düstere Ende bekommt. Ich habe aktiv versucht dagegen anzuwirken, dass ich ein ""böses"" Ende bekomme. Vergebens. 
[spoiler](So findet man Dokumente erst spät, die einem überhaupt eröffnen, dass man die ""Monster"" mit der Kamera sehen kann und sie umschleichen könnte, statt sie mit Licht zu töten) - (Erst am Ende des Spiels erfährt man, dass die hölzernen ""Totems"" die man die ganze Zeit zerstört hat [weil der Hund Angst vor ihnen hat!], nicht zerstört werden sollten, und das auch nur indirekt) - (Weitere Faktoren für ein Gutes Ende bleiben verschleiert)[/spoiler] 
- Die Passage gegen Ende, die im Haus stattfindet (ohne weitere Spoiler zu nennen) ist extrem zäh gewesen, hat mich meiste Zeit eher genervt und wurde nur selten spannender. Besonders, dass ich die - ich nenne sie mal Monster - nur umgehen konnte, in dem ich mich mit dem Rücken zu ihnen gewandt und mit Licht aus durch das Haus taste, hat mich immens genervt. Das hat sich gezogen wie Kaugummi. 
- Ich habe mich nur ein einziges Mal erschrocken in diesem Spiel und das war mir für ein Horrorspiel doch etwas zu wenig. Vielleicht hätte man mehr Stimmung, mehr Grusel aufbauen können oder zumindest mal ein, zwei wirklich gute Jumpscares einbauen können? Ich bin eine sehr schreckhafte Spielerin und es heißt für mich schon etwas, wenn ich kaum Anspannung in einem Horrorspiel verspüre. 

Fazit:
Mit ca. 5 Spielstunden ist es ein kurzes, nettes Game, das man sich schon mal für nen 10er gönnen könnte. Wer das Spiel mit allem drum und dran mindestens 2 mal durchspielen will, kommt sicherlich auf 10 Spielstunden gesamt. Doch wirklich lohnen tut sich ein 2. Durchlauf nicht, nur um ein paar Sekunden andere Szenen am Ende zu haben. Es hat meiner Meinung nach keinen Wiederspielwert und es ätzt an, dass Spieler*innen in den meisten Fällen direkt das schlechte Ende haben werden.",

Super disappointing as I'm a big fan of the Blair Witch movies. The IP feels completely wasted on this game - save for the stick figures you find around the world, there's nothing about this game that would suggest that this couldn't be any other generic ""lost in the woods"" type horror game.

Most of the game has you exploring the ""spooky"" woods, which loses it's fun the first 10 minutes in, with clunky movement, leading to you getting stuck by what appears to be invisible walls, only to look down at your feet and see that your movement was halted by a twig that you could easily have stepped over. This combined with the game's attempted to simulate the feeling of being lost in the woods, and eschewing typical visual cues to lead you from one destination to the next, makes the game feel like an exercise in futility. 

Things get even worse when it gets dark, with your character's dollar tree flashlight illuminating a generous 30% of your screen, with your surroundings being near pitch black. Combine this with the absolutely terrible environmental layout and plenty of false paths, you won't be feeling any fear - just nausea and frustration. 

Gameplay is woefully lacking. The only sort of ""puzzle solving"" in this game revolves around a camcorder with which you play and pause the tapes you find scattered around the world. Pausing the video at the right time with change something in your surroundings to allow you to progress, so once you've done this once, you know exactly what to expect each time you find a tape. Not very interesting past the second or third time you do this. Other than that, everything else is standard fair - look around the environment, find a code for a padlock, collect gears to fix a machine, etc. There is ""combat"" in the game, which just revolves around you shining your flashlights on enemies (a la Alan Wake). When the enemy takes a hit it scrambles around the trees, requiring you to look around and shine it again. It loses it's charm after the first encounter, as you're going to be ""fighting"" the same enemy throughout the entire game. 

Main character is serviceable, dialogue and sound is ok, the dog is cute. But other than that, the actual gameplay and environments are bland and boring. At the point of this review I am on Chapter 15 (out of 17), so not completely done with the game. I've heard that the final stretch takes place in the legendary house, so hoping that'll provide something new. Just had to come and vent right now after playing a sequence in the game where it had you walk around the same loop in the dark for literally 5 minutes straight without any indication of what you're supposed to do, leading to your character eventually just collapsing and passing out to progress the story.


Updated: Finished the game. The final sequence at the house is novel for the first 5 minutes, but goes on forever, to the point where it feels like an absolute slog. The same impact could have been had in a quarter of the time - it feels like much of what goes on was made to pad the playtime. The sequence entirely revolves around reminding you that the main character isn't a good person, which the game has already been doing from the very beginning. It feels like the developers are beating you over the head - each flashback or reality distortion had me rolling my eyes and just eager to move on to the next room and get the game over with as quickly as possible. Also warning for those that get nauseous in games - the entire final chapter has liberal use of a ""shaky cam"" effect - that coupled with the extremely limited FOV (which the game doesn't let you change), and sequences where the game forces you to look down at the floor, may make you sick. I haven't gotten sick from playing games in years - this was the first time where it made me feel physically ill towards the end. 

Story wise, the game's ending was about what I would expect - not very satisfying.

Бред душевнобольного! Плутать по лесу, где очень мало ориентиров, это редкое издевательство. По началу легко определить куда тебе нужно идти, но ближе к середине игры, не важно в какую сторону ты пойдёшь, ведь по итогу очутишься в одном и том же месте, ведь это замкнутый круг. Под конец вообще молил бога, чтобы эта наркомания как можно быстрее закончилась. Если по началу вы полностью погружены в реальность и только иногда вас преследуют видения, то под конец я целый час ползал по заброшенному дому в своих глюках. Если не выполнить ряд условий, который вы без путеводителя никогда не сможете выполнить, то можете забыть о хорошей концовке. То есть, если при первом прохождении я хочу получить удовлетворительный финал, мне нужен гайд, но тогда я словлю все существующие сюжетные спойлеры. Если буду играть без гайда, то от полученной концовки определённо захочется отправиться в психушку для лечения. Может быть кого-то прикалывает подобный психоделический мазохизм, но меня нет. Первым прохождение я остался крайне недоволен, а на второй заход у меня банально не хватит нервов. Не потому что в сюжете присутствуют тяжёлые для осознания ходы, а потому что переварить всю эту наркотическую кашу тяжело с точки зрения психики...эпилептические вспышки, блуждание по нескончаемому ущелью, которое повторяется пока у вас не поедет крыша.

[b]Привет, начнем с того что я не знаком с первоисточником, да и вообще слышал о данной франшизе всего пару раз за жизнь. Увидев трейлер на Е3 не сразу и понял, что игра оказывается по вселенной фильмов Ведьмы из Блэр, которая берет свое начало аж в 1999 году![/b]
После этого об игре я на время забыл и вспомнил только о ее существовании только ближе к релизу на который наткнулся в календаре. Первое, что меня в ней удивило так это то что она инди. На момент етришного трейлера казалось что это как минимум AA-игра и в ней место хотя бы средненькому бюджету. Оттуда и вытекающая цена - на релизе игра стоит 463 рубля со скидкой в 10%. Стоит подумать, что Bloober Team не возлагали больших надежд на ее продажи и видимо не прогадали сделав такой заманчивый ценник.

Итак, игра начинается с достаточно бюджетного ролика, где пару раз мелькает абсолютно деревянное лицо главного героя - Эллиса. Не менее скучно и бедно он прописан. Эллис представляет из себя этакого героя-тряпку, которого бросила жена, не ставят ни во что на работе да и вообще единственный его друг это собака, которая кстати является одной из главных механик игры. Псиныч будет выполнять роль компаса и сопровождать нас по коридорам бескрайнего леса, напичканного духами и коллекционируемыми предметами типа колышков и фотографий с героями из фильмов.
Собственно весь лес из себя представляет набор открытых уровней в котором вы ходите от точки к точке и получаете пазл из сюжета в виде видеокассет (нигде такого не было!) и улик, которые приводят вас к такой же точке. Иногда он хоть и может испугать, но абсолютно не выглядит живым и представляет из себя просто набор пустых тропок с скучными декорациями.
В чем же хоррор элемент этой игры? Время от времени на вас будут нападать демоны-жутики которых вы будете убивать фонариком [spoiler] (еще одна оригинальная идея)[/spoiler]. Перестают эти ребята пугать уже после раза третьего, после чего жутким только остается изредка лес, благодаря постоянным шорохами в кустах и бликами на земле. Абсолютно обыденный прием в играх этого жанра. При этом если в той же Outlast он применен правильно, и отлично работает, то в ведьме он приедается за два часа игры.

Не менее пугающим стало в игре и количество багов, за все прохождение я целых ТРИ раза застрял в текстурах! Из-за чего мне приходилось возвращаться к сейвам, которые могли быть сделаны минут 30 назад. Во время прохождения это сильно портило целостное мнение об игре.
Под конец прохождения, сюжет из игры оставлял очень много вопросов и мне пришлось ознакомится с несколькими материалами чтоб он обрел хоть какой то смысл. И если в нем на какой то важным момент по типу лора Ведьмы выделено максимум минут 30, то на историю мертвых солдат, которая вообще как по мне была зря втиснута, выделено часа 2. И все эти два часа ГГ просто ходит и говорит мол это он во всем виноват и их кровь на его руках. Вообщем сюжет получился очень скомканным и до конца неясным.

Проходя игру в районе 7-8 часов, она просто неимоверно мне надоела. Весь геймплей после первых двух часов превратился в коридорную прогулку разбавленную однотипными мобами. Про ведьму кстати не было почти не слова, к концу игры она так и не появилась.",

К поискам мальчика подключается Эллис — бывший коп, который надеется спасением ребёнка искупить грехи прошлого. В компании верного пса Пули он отправляется в лес Блэк-Хиллз, где пару лет назад уже исчезла группа студентов. Собака быстро берёт след, но тот уводит Эллиса всё глубже в чащу. И в лесу, где размываются привычные рамки времени и пространства, герой сталкивается не только с человеком, похитившим Питера, но и с собственными демонами.

Параллельно основной сюжетной линии о поиске ребенка разворачивается и несколько второстепенных историй. Довольно быстро становится ясно, что у Эллиса сложное прошлое: его преследуют приступы паники и видения о некой трагедии, а по телефону он пытается наладить отношения с бывшей женой. Именно от ваших действий зависит, чем все закончится: можете брать трубку или игнорировать, позвонить первым или максимально отстраниться. На телефоне, кстати, можно и в «Змейку» поиграть. Вот это внимание к деталям!

Рутинные поиски постепенно сплетаются в клубок мистических событий. В глубине леса герой находит камеру, которая обладает загадочным свойством — материализует сцены с проигрываемых пленок. Поставили на стоп-кадр момент, где жертва бросает на землю предмет, и он действительно появляется в том месте. Большинство загадок построено на этом фокусе. И еще иногда нужно просить пса достать вещь, до которой вы сами не дотягиваетесь.

В отличие от многих подобных страшилок, Blair Witch отличают относительный простор окружения и редкая нынче в ужастиках возможность отбиться от жуткого нечто, которое тенью мечется среди деревьев. Моменты «сражений» (полноценным боем это сложно назвать) напоминают об Alan Wake, только от первого лица — надо на несколько мгновений зафиксировать луч света на твари, чтобы спугнуть ее, выиграв тем самым драгоценные секунды.

+ Визуальное оформление. Лес получился очень реалистичным, живым, практически настоящим. При любом освещении, днем и ночью верится, что этот лес живой, и что ты в нем заблудился.
+ Музыка. Она жутка и атмосферная. Или просто жутко атмосферная, даже не знаю, как правильней.
+ Атмосфера. Благодаря детально проработанному лесу, свету и освещению, звукам и музыке создается жутко реалистичное ощущение . Это чувство начинает давить и не отпускает до до самого домика ведьмы, который, между прочим, воссоздан практически там же как в первом и третьем фильме.

Das Jahr 1996: In dem Black Hills Forest in Maryland verschwindet ein neunjähriger Junge. Dem Polizei-Suchtrupp schließt sich Ellis Lynch, der früher selbst einmal Polizist gewesen ist, an. An seiner Seite ist sein Hund Bullet, ein treuer Begleiter mit guter Spürnase. Ellis wagt sich auf eigene Faust in die tiefen Wälder - doch dort erwartet ihn weitaus Schlimmeres als Dunkelheit und wilde Tiere...

Blair Witch kam bereits 2019 als Download heraus und wurde 2020 als Retail-Version nachgeschoben. Wie der Name unschwer erkennen lässt, hat das Spiel seinen Platz in der Welt der Blair-Witch-Filme - wobei ich persönlich finde, dass das Spiel wesentlich besser als die Filme ist, um das gleich mal vorwegzunehmen. Außerdem hat die Story des Spiels nur minimal etwas mit der der Filme zu tun: Bis auf den Schauplatz - der Black Hills Forest sowie im späteren Verlauf das Haus, dem aus dem 2016er Blair-Witch-Film nachempfunden ist - und der Legende um die Hexe, die im Spiel aber keine übergeordnete Rolle spielt, gibt es keine Gemeinsamkeiten.

DER HORROR

Blair Witch (das Spiel) setzt voll und ganz auf psychologischen Horror: Fast alles spielt sich im Kopf des Protagonisten ab, der mit seiner Vergangenheit zu kämpfen hat. Unter anderem leidet Ellis als Kriegsveteran unter PTBS (Posttraumatische Belastungsstörung) und erlebt Flashbacks, in denen er sich in den Krieg zurückversetzt fühlt. Doch es geschehen weitaus ungewöhnlichere Dinge: Die Zeit scheint Sprünge zu machen, im Wald treiben unheimliche Kreaturen ihr Unwesen, überhaupt scheint der Wald nach seinen eigenen Regeln zu spielen. Vom Prinzip her erinnert mich das an Silent Hill, besonders den zweiten Teil.

DIE SPIELMECHANIK

Gemeint ist damit aber nur die Komponente des psychologischen Horrors, nicht das Gameplay. Gespielt wird Blair Witch nämlich in First-Person-Perspektive, Waffen gibt es im herkömmlichen Sinne keine. Dennoch ist das Spiel viel mehr als ein Walking Simulator, denn man muss mit vielen Gegenständen interagieren und sein Inventar benutzen. Dazu gehört auch eine Taschenlampe, die in Alan-Wake-Manier als Waffe gegen die an bestimmten Stellen im Wald umherhuschenden Monster eingesetzt werden kann. Diese ""Kämpfe"" sind nicht besonders schwierig, aber aufgepasst: Will man das gute Ende erreichen, darf man die Monster nicht töten. Diese werden durch das Licht der Taschenlampe überhaupt erst aufgescheucht, also lässt man die Lampe am besten aus.

Okay, dann ist es während der Nacht-Sequenzen natürlich stockfinster, aber es gibt eine Videokamera, die man statt der Lampe in die Hand nehmen kann - und die Kamera hat einen Nachtsichtmodus. Mit dessen Hilfe kann man sich an den Monstern vorbeischleichen, was allerdings schwieriger ist, als sie zu bekämpfen. Außerdem sieht man trotz Nachtsichtmodus im Dunkeln nicht gerade viel, also anders als bei Outlast, bei dem es eine ähnliche Mechanik gibt. Dafür muss man in Blair Witch keine Angst haben, dass einem die Batterien für die Kamera ausgehen, das Teil hat unbegrenzt Saft.

Die Kamera hat aber noch eine weitere Funktion: An manchen Stellen findet man Videobänder, die auf der Kamera abgespielt werden können. Diese beeinflussen die Realität: Zum Beispiel steht man vor einer verschlossenen Tür. Guckt man sich ein Video an, auf dem diese Tür erst offen ist und dann geschlossen wird, spult man das Band zu der Stelle zurück, an der die Tür noch offen ist und pausiert dann - schon ist die Tür auch in der Realität offen. Von diesen Video-Puzzles gibt es im Spiel mehrere, darüber hinaus gibt es ein paar weitere Rätsel, die aber alle nicht besonders kniffelig sind.

Ein Problem ist oft die Wegfindung, denn das Spiel versteht es, das Gefühl zu vermitteln, sich in dem riesigen Wald zu verlaufen - obwohl das Spielareal selbst gar nicht so groß ist. Der Trick ist, dass bestimmte Areale sich einfach wiederholen, man gerät also in einen Loop, wenn man den falschen Weg nimmt. Zum Beispiel rennt man von einem Punkt aus immer geradeaus und kommt irgendwann wieder am Ausgangsort an. Erklären lässt sich das aber nicht nur durch das Verlaufen, sondern auch den Spuk in Ellis' Kopf. Zum Glück hat man seinen Hund dabei, der einem oft dabei hilft, den richtigen Weg zu finden. Mit Bullet lässt sich per Tastendruck auch interagieren und man kann ihm Befehle geben. Außerdem warnt Bullet vor nahenden Gefahren.

Das Spiel ist die reinste Abwärtsspirale in Ellis' Psyche, denn je weiter man vorankommt, desto abgedrehter wird Blair Witch. Der Gipfel ist entsprechend der finale Abschnitt, bei dem die Realität sich fast völlig verabschiedet hat. Hier bewegt man sich in Layers-of-Fear-Dimensionen, soll heißen: Wenn man einen Raum betritt und sich dann umdreht, ist nicht garantiert, dass da immer noch der Raum ist, den man gerade eben verlassen hat - dort könnte etwas völlig anderes sein. Kein Wunder: Die polnischen Entwickler von Bloober Team, von denen Blair Witch stammt, haben schließlich auch Layers of Fear kreiert.

DER UMFANG
Allzu umfangreich ist Blair Witch nicht, innerhalb weniger Stunden ist man durch mit dem Spiel. Dafür bietet es, wie schon erwähnt, verschiedene Enden, die man erreichen kann (eines kann man sogar erst beim zweiten Durchgang freischalten), außerdem punktet es mit seiner dichten Horror-Atmosphäre, die mit erfreulich wenigen Jumpscares auskommt. Die Story mag zunächst ziemlich verworren erscheinen, doch setzt man ihre Puzzlestücke zusammen, ergibt alles einen Sinn. 

Blait Witch spielt sich recht intuitiv und flüssig, die Optik ist gelungen und auch der Sound ist, passend zur Atmosphäre, stimmungsvoll. 

Mein Fazit: 
Ich hatte sehr viel Spaß mit Blair Witch und kann das Spiel auf jeden Fall zu 100 Prozent empfehlen. Wer sich für psychologischen Horror erwärmen kann und schon immer mal wissen wollte, wie wohl ein Mix aus Layers of Fear, Outlast, Silent Hill und Alan Wake ist, sollte Blair Witch auf jeden Fall mal antesten. :)",
85682213,german,2021.00.31 13:41,✅,❌,0.6929395795,15,"[h1] Auch ohne Hexe gut![/h1]

Grundlage des Spiels ist der Film ""Blair Witch Project"" aus dem Jahr 1999 (die eher zweifelhaften Fortsetzungen lasse ich mal außen vor). Vorab sollte man wissen: das Spiel erzählt eine ganz eigene Geschichte und die Hexe von Blair dient bestenfalls als bessere Randnotiz. Wenn man nach dem Spielen aber ein wenig mehr in die Materie einsteigen möchte, kann man durchaus ein paar Bezüge finden. Optisch wird Kennern des Films auf jeden Fall etwas geboten, was die Nähe zum Film deutlich macht.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2379697661
Allgemein ist Blair Witch atmosphärisch ein echtes Brett! Der Wald von Burkittsville wird sehr gut dargestellt und wer die technischen Möglichkeiten dazu hat, sollte unbedingt HDR aktivieren, da die Spielwelt dadurch nochmals immersiver wirkt (meine Screenshots wurden ohne HDR aufgenommen, da Steam allgemein Probleme mit Bildern im HDR-Modus hat). Des Weiteren solltet ihr den Tipp zu Beginn des Spiels beherzigen und Blair Witch mit einem Kopfhörer spielen. Die Tonaufnahmen wurden mit binauralem Audio aufgenommen, so dass eine wirklich schaurig schöne Soundkulisse entsteht, die manche Geräusche wahnsinnig ""echt"" erscheinen lässt. Allerdings liegt das Qualitätsniveau des binauralen Audios nicht auf dem Niveau eines ""Hellblade"" oder ""The Suicide of Rachel Foster"" - bei den beiden Spielen war es ein noch intensiverer Genuss!

Was man von Blair Witch auch nicht erwarten sollte: es handelt sich um kein dezidiertes Horrorspiel. Diesbezüglich ist das Spiel stimmig zum Film, Dinge werden primär angedeutet und nicht gezeigt. Aber so oder so dürften auch die meisten Spieler vor dem Horror größtenteils verschont bleiben. Natürlich ist sowas rein subjektiv, aber trotz sehr dichter Atmosphäre kam ich nie an solchen Stellen, bei denen ich dachte ""nein - ich will nicht weiterspielen, ich will nicht durch diese Tür gehen"", oder etwas in dieser Art. Für mich war der Aspekt nicht negativ, aber man sollte es vorab wissen. Es gibt durchaus ein paar Jumpscares (speziell zum Ende des Spiels hin), aber im Genrevergleich sind selbige recht harmlos. 

Blair Witch ist auch kein Actionspiel, ""bewaffnet"" sind wir lediglich mit unserer Taschenlampe und unserer Videokamera. Wir spielen eine sehr persönliche Geschichte des Protagonisten und dieser durchlebt im Spiel seinen eigenen Horror. Das Spiel würde auch ohne den Blair Witch-Kontext gut funktionieren, aber als Freund des ersten Teils war es für mich durchaus sehr schön, nach rund 20 Jahren mal wieder in dieses Universum abzutauchen. Die Handschrift des Entwicklers Bloober Team ist dem Spiel übrigens deutlich anzumerken. Gerade wer Layers of Fear gespielt hat, dürfte die Mechaniken wiedererkennen. Diese werden in Blair Witch größtenteils aber deutlich subtiler eingesetzt und man merkt die Veränderungen anfangs fast gar nicht - wirklich gut gemacht!

Alles in allem hat mir die Story ziemlich gut gefallen und auch die Idee dazu finde ich sehr gelungen. Allerdings kann ich dazu nichts sagen, dies würde zu viel verraten. Speziell die Sache mit dem Grund, warum der Protagonist überhaupt in den Wald geht, verrät im Nachhinein viel. Für alle, die das Spiel bereits durchgespielt haben und die über den Grund gar nichts gefunden haben, hier ein bisschen mehr dazu (Achtung Spoiler zum Ende des Spiels): 

[spoiler]Seid ihr am Ende enttäuscht und fragt euch, was nun mit Peter geschehen ist? Dies lässt sich herausfinden, wenn man aufmerksam spielt - auf eine interessante Art: im letzten Kapitel kommt ihr an eine Tür mit dem Blair Witch-Symbol. Bevor ihr dem Spiel weiter folgt und durch die Tür geht, schaut einmal etwas weiter rechts von der Tür: dort findet ihr einen Tisch und darauf liegt eine Batterie. Könnt ihr euch an den Bunker im ersten Drittel des Spiels erinnern? Die Bunkertür konnte man noch recht einfach knacken (notfalls bekommt man im späteren Verlauf eine SMS mit dem Code) und im Bunker steht ein Funkgerät, welchem die Batterie fehlt - hier kommt man im ersten Spieldurchgang nicht weiter. 

Ihr müsst also einen zweiten Durchgang starten und habt die Batterie beim zweiten Spielen direkt am Anfang im Inventar, sofern ihr sie gefunden habt. Wenn ihr den Weg kennt, kommt ihr auch recht schnell zum Bunker. Erwartet da keine zu große Erkenntnis über Peter, aber die Idee dahinter (die Batterie im zweiten Anlauf zu haben und die Erkenntnis, dass die Sache schon vor zwei Jahren passierte (daher auch das verfallene Zelt)) finde ich ziemlich clever. Sie zeigt, dass sich Ellis/Carver in einer gedanklichen Zeitschleife befindet und die Geschehnisse immer wieder durchlebt und auf Erlösung hofft. [/spoiler]

[b]Wer die Spiele von Bloober Team mag, kann wohl bedenkenlos zugreifen. Speziell Layers of Fear-Fans können wohl kaum etwas falsch machen. Man darf sich eben nur nicht zu viel von der Blair Witch-Thematik an sich erhoffen, ansonsten könnte man enttäuscht werden. Ich habe für mich einen intensiven Trip in menschliche Abgründe erlebt - auch ohne große Schockmomente. Aber bitte nicht falsch verstehen: für sehr schreckhafte Spieler könnte Blair Witch durchaus nicht ganz ohne sein. Speziell am Ende gibt das Spiel ordentlich Gas und lässt auch technisch seine Muskeln spielen. [/b]",

Ba, powiedziałbym nawet, że jest to jeden z najlepszych horrorów, w jakie miałem przyjemność grać. Od początku do końca trzyma w napięciu, a przede wszystkim straszy! Nie wygląda to tak jak w większości współczesnych horrorów, że grę kończy się napier*alając do bossa z RPG i jest się obładowanym pasami amunicji i bronią niczym Rambo.
Gra jest ciemna, klaustrofobiczna, odczuć można cały czas presję zagrożenia chowającego się za rogiem. Jedyną formą obrony przed wrogami jest tutaj latarka. Sam klimat gry jest niezwykle przejmujący, mroczny (tak jak to powinno być w horrorze).  Dodatkowej oryginalności tej grze, tym bardziej w tym gatunku, jest obecność towarzysza, którym jest pies. Bullet'a (bo tak ma na imię) będziesz chronić własnym życiem, a wasza więź się pogłębi. Naprawdę zależy na tym psie, a przeżycia z nim związane wywołują głębokie emocje.

Blair Witch is based on a movie that made popular the found-footage genre and takes place few years after said movie. Taking a role of a former officer from a small town with dark history, demons in his head and loyal canine companion by his side, you will set out to explore the dark forest looking for a missing boy. While its premise is quite simple, the execution is really interesting. The game is linear with possible changes you can make during your walkthrough to get different ending, however, it has some non-linear elements such as letting you decide, how you treat your dog, Bullet, who you call and how much and more. 

The game is unfortunately sufferíng from a variety of issues such as too many situations, scripted in a way that makes you think you have no control over anything. I get that the game intentionally coerces you into not knowing what is real or what is not, but here in certain passages it is almost nonsensical and it does detract from the experience a bit.

Despite this, Blair Witch is a great game to play, if you are in the market for psychological horrors.

[b] Pros [/b]

+ Gorgeous graphics - Unreal Engine really shines in this game
+ Amazing level design which replicates beautiful (and at times ominous) nature of Maryland
+ Great sound design. both with soundtrack and surround sounds
+ Relationship with Bullet that you can influence
+ Options you have outside of main story - calling various people, playing games on your phone...
+ Monsters
+ Characters
+ Animations
+ Endings
+ Voice acting
+ Lighting
+ Atmosphere

[b] Cons [/b]

- Bugs
- It is simply not possible to obtain the other main ending without the use of a outside guide as there are very specific instruction
- Some sequences which feel pointless","[h1] [i] While having its fair share of errors, Blair Witch if definitely one of the most interesting horror games out there [/i] [/h1]

Nie polecam brać nawet na sporych przecenach. Ale po kolei.
Plusy: Na pewno nasz pies Bullet i chyba tyle. No jeszcze czas gry. Jest to tytuł na tyle krótki, że udało mi się zmusić się do jego przejścia jeden raz. Na więcej nie mam siły ani ochoty.
Minusy: Bardzo słaba fabuła. Ponoć Bloober chciał  pokazać trudności/przeszkody w powrocie do normalnego życia żołnierzy powracających po wojnie, ale cóż stwierdzenie, że im nie wyszło to najmniejszy wymiar kary. Niejasne warunki jakie trzeba spełnić aby dostać dobre zakończenie. Ogólnie bez poradnika przejście gry za pierwszym razem z uzyskaniem dobrego zakończenia jest praktycznie niemożliwe.

If they make a sequel i hope they improve on the areas that are lacking because this has the potential to be a fantastic horror game it just needs some changes to the story most notably the poor ending which i think most people are on agreement with and combat could be more prevalent and expanded upon as well.,Honestly this game is fairly solid right up until the end where it feels rushed and silly.

What I did like:
-The forest looked really realistic, nice textures, lighting
-The sound is really immersive
-Interacting with the doggy (petting him, following him, getting hints from him)
-The story really got me invested in the characters; I wanted to know what really happened
-Voice acting is good and well timed. 
-The puzzles with the camera were neat and novel.
-Cellphone was neat.

What I didn't like:
-Exploring felt pointless as finding photos and carvings are useless.
-Most of the time telling your dog to search does nothing.
-The ending was terrible and I have no idea why I got it. I called girlfriend. I pet the dog, saved it and didn't mistreat it. Why?
-The last part in the house was sooo tedious and repetitive, the scares mild and the whole experience just confusing and frustrating.
-Some interactions between the characters was cringe-inducingly bad. 
-Hardly any connection to the movie aside from the fact there's a forest, some twig totems, an old house and supposedly a witch.
-Left me feeling disturbed, confused, unsatisfied and disappointed.
-""Combat"" is a little boring and frankly, not that scary at all.
-A lot of long, tedious segments that overstay their welcome. 

Why the bad ending though??? Bloober team that was just mean. :(

 Após um tempo perdido a gente conseguiu encontrar o objetivo saímos e logo ficou de noite.
 ficamos mais um tempo tentando entender como funcionava a FITA, juro que ficamos apertando espaço umas mil vezes até ver que interpretamos tudo errado, mas... conseguimos e então começamos a avançar muito mais rápido até que!

One of the biggest complaints I have seen from other people is that this game does not follow the movie Blair Witch at all. To address this, I would like to first say that while this is accurate, it was not the purpose of this game to copy the movie Blair Witch in entirety. Instead, it was this games goal to use the movie as a guideline to create an entirely different, yet similar story. In relation to the movie Blare Witch, this game reminds me of the movie The Secret life of Walter Mitty. That movie was completely different than the book, however as in the game Blare Witch, the goal of that movie was not to copy the book, rather to reimagine some of the ideas in the book creating a new story from it. On another note, the navigation in this game is difficult. And this was another complaint from other reviewers. However, that is part of the challenge of the game, and the difficulty of navigating the environment is important for the story. If the navigation was as easy as just holding down W, as I believe some of these other reviewer’s desire, then 50% of the atmosphere of the game would be lost. So, I guess that is important to add, if you are looking for a game that you do not have to work for navigation wise, then this is not the game for you.  The user interface is relatively clean and simple to use so I have no complaints there. Overall, I would say that this game gets a B. While I did love the atmosphere and environmental design, I thought the story was lacking in some places. When playing the game, it is obvious that the developers want you to build a sympathetic connection with the main character, however, I did not feel any sympathy for the main character. And I believe the reason for this is poor story writing. Additionally, the game’s story has this fundamental premise that, if you stand up and fight against the witch and the other villain in the game, you are punished with the worst ending. But if you do not bother the witch and you remain obedient to the other villain in the game then you get the good ending. This is the aspect of this game that I disliked the most. I disliked the fact that rebellion or challenging authority, was met with severe punishment and obedience was met with reward. This overall idea that the storyline put forward left a bad taste in my mouth, as my personal motto is “stand up and question everything”, and I think overall, that greatly impacted my ability to connect with the main character. In summary, I would give this game an A for atmosphere and environmental design, A B+ for the user interface, and a C- for the overall story. Therefore, I would recommend this game to anyone looking for an atmospheric horror game, not necessarily a game that will scare them senseless or build a meaningful connection between the main character and the player.","Blare Witch reminds me a lot of the cursed forest. I thoroughly enjoyed both the atmosphere and the environments of this game just as the cursed forest. One of the biggest complaints I have seen from other people is that this game does not follow the movie Blair Witch at all. To address this, I would like to first say that while this is accurate, it was not the purpose of this game to copy the movie Blair Witch in entirety. Instead, it was this games goal to use the movie as a guideline to create an entirely different, yet similar story. In relation to the movie Blare Witch, this game reminds me of the movie The Secret life of Walter Mitty. That movie was completely different than the book, however as in the game Blare Witch, the goal of that movie was not to copy the book, rather to reimagine some of the ideas in the book creating a new story from it. On another note, the navigation in this game is difficult. And this was another complaint from other reviewers.

[b] Lenda da Bruxa de Blair [/b]

A bruxa de Blair é uma lenda de uma senhora idosa Elly Kedward que foi acusada de feitiçaria, e após ser acusada, julgada, considera culpada, e evitada pelos moradores de Burkittsville, foi banida para a floresta Black Woods. Onde acreditam que ela foi executada. Seu corpo amarrado ao tronco de uma arvore e deixada para sucumbir aos elementos. 
O filme de terror lançado no ano de 1999 e foi que definiu um gênero inteiro de filmes. o famoso Found Footage. Que são filmes em que geralmente vemos o decorrer dele do ponto de vista do personagem gravando o que acontece como se fosse pra recordação própria. ou o ""Homemade"".

[b] Ao jogo [/b]

Inspirado no folcore cinematográfico de Blair Witch Project, O jogo conta a história de Ellis um ex-policial e veterano que conta com a ajuda de seu cachorro chamado bullet, se junta a um time de resgate devido o sumiço de um garoto na floresta de Black Hills em Burkittsville, Maryland.

O jogo tem a exploração como seu principal foco, interação com o cenário e uma pitada de puzzles a maioria deles envolvendo fitas cassetes e você saber a que lugar ir. Um elemento crucial do gameplay é o cachorro que te acompanha, Bullet. O jogador consegue interagir com seu cachorro por uma lista de comandos como, ""Stay"", ""Stay close"", ""Reprimand"", ""Pet"" e ""Seek"". E em diversas parte do jogo Bullet te ajuda farejando certas coisas, buscando outras e até mesmo te ajudando a chegar até o seu objetivo. Vendo que estamos falando de uma busca no meio da floresta. Ou seja você não possui nenhum mapa ou qualquer ferramente de navegação pra te guiar a onde ir.

Outro ponto que é dito como importante porém que eu não vi muita pesar no personagem é o nivel de sanidade. É dito que a sanidade é um ponto importante também entretanto é algo que eu não cheguei nem a sentir. É claro que em determinados pontos da história seguindo o roteiro sim o personagem passa por isso porem em exploração ou fora de ""cutscenes"" não. Lembrando de como era toda o peso que isso trazia no personagem em Amnesia acho que foi uma função não muito explorada.

Entretanto, Apesar de eu ter gostado muito do jogo creio que alguns pontos eu devo mencionar pois achei que se arrastaram um pouco. O decorrer do jogo até o final é tudo certo, a exploração a interação com o Bullet. Tudo muito lindo. Porém perto do final do jogo ao chegar ali nos 1h restante ou 30 min restante o jogo se arrasta demais, em um cenário onde vc anda e anda e anda e anda e anda por de novo 30 minutos a 1 hora e só a mesma coisa acontece... foi uma das partes desgastantes do jogo, a única, porem foi...

Ele tem uma duração bem baixa também, na minha primeira gameplay demorei 5 horas e pouco pra terminar.

Fora isso creio que o jogo consegue passar bem o sentimento de terror psicológico. Fazia tempinho que eu não jogava nenhum jogo de terror, mendo sendo fã do gênero, então pra mim foi bem aterrorizante.",

Ela possui alguns fiéis que vivem na floresta ou nas proximidades, eles obedecem ordens e até fazem sacrifícios sob o comando dela. Eles parecem estar sobre o encanto de alguma magia.

Houve relato de madereiros dizendo que também avistaram uma idosa nua cujos os pés não tocavam o rio. Depois disso, varias crianças ficaram desaparecidas e com rastros até a floresta. Grupos de busca foram enviados, encontrando marcas de runas, gravetos amarrados parecendo bonecos e esculturas em madeira. Realmente encontraram uma idosa cujo o nome era Elly Kedward, a mesma foi enforcada em 1880 como uma Bruxa. A floresta foi abandonada e mantida como assombrada. Após isso, pessoas continuaram desaparecendo na floresta, entre alguns casos, houve um de maior destaque, onde foram encontrados 5 madeireiros mortos de forma ritualística. Nos anos 90, 7 crianças ficaram desaparecidas no mesmo local e uma força tarefa policial foi feita, encontrando um homem, de aproximadamente 40 anos vivendo na floresta.

[quote=Пошукова група 2] Офігіти, він знайшов дерево! У лісі![/quote]

Оригінальна Відьма з Блер якщо й не винайшла жанр мок'юментарі, то вже точно його популяризувала, завдяки чому на світ почали з'являтися стрічки різноманітної тематики та якості, які за останні 20 років встигли як увійти в моду, так і втратити свою популярність. Зробити гру за фільмом, який начебто і сам є екранізацією хоррора від першої особи? Звучить як щось, що рано чи пізно мало статися. Наразі Blair Witch - останній повноцінний проєкт студії Bloober Team, яка вже встигла зарекомендувати себе як творців психологічних хорорів, випустивши раніше дилогію Layers of Fear і хорор-кіберпанк Observer.

Мені було цікаво, що у них вийде цього разу, адже сама тематика фільму трохи відрізнялася від концепцій їхніх звичайних ігор, та й хорорів про блукання лісом за останні роки вийшло досить і хотілося б чогось якісного. За підсумком же можу сказати, що гра вийшла суперечливою: маючи справді непогані та незаїжджені механіки, а також інтригуючі сюжетні елементи, вона примудряється ледь не на кожен свій плюс підібрати недолік, а деякі з них є ще й дикими кліше в рамках хоррорів. 

При цьому виникає враження, що розробники отримали права на ""франшизу"", але не до кінця розуміли, що ж із нею робити, а тому в грі вистачає моментів, коли можна було детальніше розкрити суть того, що відбувається, чи додати якихось цікавих елементів, однак ці дірки закриваються банальними прийомами, що кочують з однієї гри блуберів в іншу, поступово перетворюючись на ознаку поганого смаку.

[h1]📖 «Сюжет»[/h1]

Дія відбувається через кілька років після подій оригінального фільму, у вересні 1996 року, а протагоністом виступає Елліс Лінч - колишній військовий, а нині поліцейський, який займається пошуками хлопчика, що зник у відомому лісі. Він приєднується до пошукової групи, незважаючи на явне небажання місцевого шерифа, і разом зі своїм псом на прізвисько [strike]Кама Куля[/strike] Буллет шукає зачіпки, просуваючись дедалі глибше в похмурий ліс, де й розгортатимуться всі події гри.

Власне, весь сюжет і буде про те, як Елліс із Буллетом блукають лісом, що стає все більш зловісним. При цьому частина сюжетних елементів гри заслуговує на похвалу, в той час як інша частина лише викликає запитання на кшталт ""Доки?"". Отже, що ж зроблено добре? Весь вступний акт, нагнітання атмосфери, а також епізоди, коли головний герой, та й сам гравець теж, губиться в часі й не розуміє, що взагалі там коїться. Що зроблено погано? На жаль, усе інше.

Уже на базовому рівні сюжет викликає питання, оскільки це не стільки історія про зловісний ліс і відьму, скільки розповідь про посттравматичний розлад самого Елліса, у якого від самого початку свистить фляга, а ліс виступає лише каталізатором. Чому не можна було зробити сюжет про психічно врівноважену людину, яка поступово втрачає зв'язок із реальністю через несприятливе оточення? Навіщо замість якихось потенційно цікавих епізодів робити приходи про військове минуле Елліса, яке його переслідує? Це так оригінально? Саме це всі хочуть побачити в грі з назвою ""Відьма з Блер або як я перестав турбуватися і полюбив Spec Ops: The Line""?

Ще одне рішення, що викликає багато запитань - кінцівки гри. Отримання поганої кінцівки не викличе проблем, але ось хороша... скажімо так, висуває вкрай дивні вимоги до гравця. Крім того, що потрібно виконати деякі умови, які краще розкривають взаємини героя із собакою (поки що логічно), хеппі-енд буквально вимагає не збирати добру половину предметів, а також ігнорувати кілька геймплейних механік, тобто, буквально просить гравця приділяти менше уваги дрібницям, та й загалом особливо не заглиблюватися в гру.

Ну, і як вишенька на торті, майже півгодинний психоделічний тріп зі скрімерами в дусі Layers of Fear і Observer ближче до фіналу гри, який мало того, що грі абсолютно не потрібен і псує вибудувану атмосферу, так ще й має вигляд дешевої спроби пропхати свою фірмову ""фішку"".

[quote=Здоров'я101] У тих, хто не рухається, на 99% вищий шанс померти.[/quote]

[h1]💻 «Геймплей»[/h1]

Зробити симулятор ходьби лісом не так вже й складно, куди складніше придумати щось цікаве, авторам, здебільшого, це вдалося, переважно завдяки впровадженню цікавих механік, які використовуються впродовж усієї гри і тісно пов'язані з сюжетом. Сюди можна віднести: собаку, камеру та телефон, адже саме на них тримається чимала частка геймплею.

Власне, Буллет - пес головного героя, перебуває поруч із ним майже всю гру, приносить усілякі корисні й не дуже речі, допомагає орієнтуватися в лісі, їсть корм, дає лапу та... майже повністю руйнує хорор-складову, адже значно складніше лякатися, коли ти мандруєш не один, навіть якщо напарник лише комп'ютерний. Помітно, що чимала частина бюджету пішла саме на нього - починаючи з поведінки та доступних команд і закінчуючи кастомізацією (кастомізація собаки в хорорі, Карл!). До того ж автори зробили все, щоб гравець прив'язався до Буллета, який ще й вирішує одвічну проблему подібних ігор з орієнтуванням у лісі.

Камера в хорорах не в новинку, досить згадати хоча б Outlast, однак і тут творці викрутилися, зробивши особливі головоломки. Так, наприклад, червоні касети дають змогу керувати реальністю, матеріалізуючи предмети з плівок, відмотавши до потрібного моменту та поставивши на паузу, монстрів можна бачити в режимі нічного бачення, ба більше, є навіть ціла глава, в якій доводиться орієнтуватися в тумані виключно за допомогою камери.

Телефон використовується значно рідше, але не менш цікавий, оскільки дає змогу отримувати СМС, відповідати на дзвінки або ж телефонувати самому. Останнє може не тільки розрядити атмосферу, а й глибше розкрити ГГ через його спілкування з іншими персонажами.

[quote=Донні]Піцерія ""У Донні""! Якщо ти зараз не замовиш, клянуся, я знайду тебе і засуну піцу тобі в cpаку!	[/quote]

[h1]🎬 «Візуал»[/h1]

Гра може запропонувати вельми непогану картину осіннього лісу в різний час доби і за різних погодних умов. Все вийшло доволі атмосферно, окремо можу виділити епізоди з лісопилкою і деревом, як такі, що особливо запам'ятовуються, в іншому візуал радує і нарікань не викликає.

[h1]🎧 «Аудіо»[/h1]

Якимось крутим саундтреком гра похизуватися не може, а тому бере звуком, що ідеально передає ліс: шурхіт листя, тріск гілок, рідкісний спів птахів, радісний гавкіт собаки - у ті рідкісні моменти, коли всі звуки зникають, стає зрозуміло, як сильно вони впливають на сприйняття і як їх не вистачає.

[b]Blair Witch - це:

👌 Приклад гарної курсової роботи
👌 Звичайний день собачника в парку 1-го січня
👌 Піца з доставкою в ліс
👌 Польський Алан Вейк
👌 ""Змійка"" як найкраща розвага
👌 А що це за дівчинка і де вона живе...
👌 Підвал будинку Бейкерів
👌 Подарунковий набір із 13 дерев'яних ділдо

[quote=Елліс]Курець? Від мене ти можеш сховатися, але сигарети тебе доконають[/quote]

[b]🔷 Гру я все ж рекомендую - хоча б через не надто тривіальні геймплейні рішення, візуалізацію лісу, взаємодію з собакою і загальну стилізацію під відеозйомку, але прошу мати на увазі те, що гра нерідко сама не знає, чим вона хоче бути, а тому кидається в крайнощі. 🔷 [/b]

Wer gerne allein im Wald sein möchte, ob Tag oder Nacht und dabei komische Geräusche nicht gleich im Panik verfallen wird für dem Spiel interessant.
Die Geschichte ähnelt aus der Horrorfilmserie von „Blair Witch“ 
Ein Junge wird vermisst und ihr wollt helfen.
Mit eurem treuen Hund geht ihr auf die Suche nach dem Jungen.
Dabei geschehen im Wald komische Sachen und ihr findet ein Cam-recorder der euch mit Hinweisen weiterhilft.
Ihr solltet im Spiel nach jedem Hinweise nachgehen da es entscheidet ist, wie das Ende wird.
Als kleiner Tipp: Die Fotos von den einzelnen Personen müsst ihr alle finden.
Zum Schluss steht ihr vor einem Tisch wo alle Fotos hängen und da fehlt eins, wird das Ende leider nicht gut ausgehen.
Ich selbst hatte 3 verschiedenen Ende es soll laut „google“ 4 geben.

Fazit zum Spiel:
7/10 Grafik
7/10 Story
6/10 Gameplay
3/5 Gänsehaut Faktor
Für den Preis 29,99 lohnt sich es nicht wirklich, wartet lieber ab, bis das Spiel im Angebot ist (letztens war es für 9,88€)

83188266,russian,2020.11.26 14:16,✅,✅,0.5,0,"Игра рассказывает нам историю главного героя с туманным и загадочным прошлым, который отправляется в глубокие леса, чтобы найти там пропавшего мальчика.
Поисковый отряд уже ушёл далеко вперед, поэтому нам предстоит, подчищать хвосты за ними, проверяй не пропустили ли они чего и достаточно быстро, мы обнаруживаем кепку пропавшего мальчика….
С этого момента и начинается медленное, но верное погружение в то безумие, что творится в этом мрачном лесу. 
Плюсы:
Графика – Визуально игра выглядит прекрасно, лес шикарен, мне было интересно бродить по нему и изучать его уголки.
Атмосфера – Главное преимущество игры, она сгущается постепенно погружая нас в тот хаос, в то безумие, что на самом деле скрывает в себе лес. Отдельно, я бы отметил эпизод в доме, это было действительно жутко и страшно. В игре хватает скримеров, но, игра давит скорее психологически, для полного погружения,  рекомендую играть в наушниках и темноте.
Собака – Буллет прекрасен и всегда выручает когда кажется, что заблудился и не знаешь куда идти.
Не забывайте хвалить его, ведь он это заслужил.
Эпизод в доме – Моя любимая часть игры, в которой безумие достигает своей максимальной концентрации. 
Змейка – За это вообще отдельный и огромный плюс, самое то в особо напряженный и страшный момент, сыграть в змейку на телефоне.
Минусы:
Сюжет – для меня в игре был, лишь один, но большой минус – сюжетная составляющая игры.
По мере прохождения игры в голове появляется множество различных интерпретации, происходящих вокруг событий, но ни одна из них так и не нашла отклика в развязке игры, а все потому, что по факту её нет. Если вы ожидаете от игры, что в финале, она разложит всё по полочкам, то спешу вас разочаровать, этого не произойдет. Каждый сам для себя решит, что же это было на самом деле.
Итог:
Хорошая для своего жанра игра, да она не привносит ничего нового, но грамотно использует все те приёмы, которые нам давно известны. Если атмосфера для вас важнее сюжета, однозначно рекомендую.

The plot is thick and rich with unsettling story and really makes you uncomfortable at times.

Ein Ermittler, der von seiner Vergangenheit heimgesucht wird, ein vermisster Junge und ein tiefer Wald, in dem etwas nicht mit rechten Dingen zuzugehen scheint. Was soll da bloß schief gehen?

Maryland, 1996 - wir schlüpfen in die Haut des ehemaligen Polizisten Ellis, der sich, begleitet von seinem treuen Hund Bullet, an der Suche nach einem vermissten Kind beteiligt. Was in seiner Vergangenheit passiert ist, warum ihm der Fall so wichtig ist und weshalb die Sache vielleicht doch keine so gute Idee war, das versucht uns Blair Witch während seiner etwa sechs Stunden Spielzeit zu vermitteln. 
Wie von Entwickler Bloober Team gewohnt findet unser Abenteuer inszenatorisch wieder auf einem hohen Level statt. Aufgrund der natürlichen Eigenschaften eines Waldes wird es dieses Mal aber etwas weitläufiger als zum Beispiel im Cyberpunk-Krimi Observer.

Diesen Freiraum nutzen die Entwickler unter anderem für eine größere Rätselsequenz, außerdem gibt es recht viele Gespräche via Telefon und Funkgerät. Wer durch die Pfadfinderausbildung gerasselt ist kann dabei auch mal Gefahr laufen sich zu verirren, doch in den meisten Fällen zeigen subtile Hinweise doch recht zuverlässig den Weg an. Sonst kann auch Hund Bullet gelegentlich helfen, dem wir einige Befehle geben können, etwa nach Spuren zu schnüffeln. Alles in allem ist der aber als narratives Element wichtiger als in spielmechanischer Hinsicht. Trotzdem ist es beruhigend, ihn in den dunkleren Momenten der Geschichte an unserer Seite zu wissen.

Von denen gibt es natürlich eine ganze Menge, schließlich wird Blair Witch als psychologisches Horroradventure gelistet. Gerade in den letzten Stunden wird das Spiel geradliniger und nähert sich dem Stil der bisherigen Spiele von Bloober an. Generell schafft es Blair Witch durch kreative, überraschende Elemente immer wieder, erinnerungswürdige und intensive Momente zu erschaffen, in denen das Spiel quasi mit dem Spieler spielt. In der allerhöchsten Gruselklasse bewegt sich das Adventure aber dennoch meistens eher nicht, was unter anderem am schützenden tierischen Begleiter, den zu manchen Teilen etwas billigen Jumpscares und den recht schnell deutlich werdenden inneren Konflikten des Protagonisten liegen mag, die sich in der Spielwelt manifestieren. Ich sehe Blair Witch eher als Mysteryspiel, das mich in manchen Teilen an ein The Vanishing of Ethan Carter und Alan Wake erinnert hat - aber mit etwas deutlicherem Horroreinschlag.

[b]Da baut sich etwas auf[/b]
Diese Review klingt bisher vielleicht eher verhalten, aber wenn man nicht mit der Erwartung herangeht, gleich das gruseligste Horrorspiel des letzten Jahrtausends zu erleben, kann Blair Witch dennoch jede Menge Potenzial entfalten. Das Pacing zwischen stressigen Situationen und Verschnaufspausen stimmt meistens und sorgt zum einen dafür, dass erstere nicht zu sehr an Wirkung verlieren, zum anderen bleibt aber auch genug Zeit, um die persönliche Story von Ellis und die Wirren des Mysteriums in diesem geheimnisvollen Wald weiterzutreiben.

Dank der gekonnten Inszenierung und einer oberflächlichen aber coolen Mechanik, durch die wir Dinge in der Spielrealität durch Vor- und Zurückspulen eines Videotapes verändern können, lässt das Spiel Raum- und Zeitlinien verschwimmen. Blair Witch gelingt dabei meinem Gefühl nach die richtige Dosis an Verwirrung, ohne zu sehr ins Absurde abzudriften oder den Spieler zu verlieren. 
Die Handlung bleibt so trotz der stetig größer werdenden Zahl an Fragezeichen bodenständig genug und schafft es dank teils klassischen, teils aber auch sehr frischen Kniffen, die übernatürlichen Elemente und psychischen Herausforderungen, mit denen Ellis zu kämpfen hat, fühlbar zu machen.

Technisch kann das Spiel gerade in den dunkleren und nebligen Sequenzen und in den Innenräumen glänzen. Auch tagsüber wirkt der Wald grundsätzlich stimmig und glaubhaft, mir hat die sehr präsent eingesetzte Tiefenschärfe aber nicht gefallen. 
Außerdem wirken die Animationen und die Wegfindung von Hund Bullet manchmal etwas hakelig. Alles in allem macht Blair Witch technisch aber einen soliden Eindruck. Auch die englische Synchronisation ist gut gelungen und wird zudem zumindest über Kopfhörer durch gelungen eingesetzte Raumklang-Effekte ergänzt.

[i]Persönliches Rating:[/i] [b]79[/b]/100

[i]Fazit:[/i]
[h3]Blair Witch gehört vielleicht nicht zu den gruseligsten Spielen der letzten Jahre, doch schafft es auf der Storyseite kontinuierlich, ein spannendes Mysterium aufzubauen und den Spieler mit oberflächigen, aber gut umgesetzten Mechaniken die Wirren und die Gefühlswelt des Protagonisten zu vermitteln.[/h3]

По геймплею Blair Witch интересный и не разу не заставил меня заскучать.
Но есть 2 минуса, но незначительных :
1. Авто сохранения редкие. Не обладая мощным ПК мой комп пару раз вырубался на некоторых моментах и приходилось всё проходить заново, хотя по логике вещей, например, после убийства монстра должен быть сейв. А сохранения через меню у меня не работали;
2. Игра не страшная (тут кому как), я за всё игру дёрнулся только 1 раз, и то можно сказать ""я себя заставил"".
Но в целом игра классная, всем рекомендую тем более она не дорогая:

Not only in it's graphics, but in it's clever story-telling and tonal changes as your sanity slips deeper into the woods.
""Boy lost in the Woods"" is a simple enough hook, although, our own mental instability, and personal flaws all driven by a morose desperation really add depth to our protagonist.
Blair Witch had so many opportunities where  it could have been lazy, or settled for simple. I can't voice enough appreciation for the detailed reverence they kept for the original Blair Witch 1999 film.

The ""Filtered Realities"" of the Video Camera were easily my favorite sections of the game. Puzzles hidden in the red tapes... brilliant.

Игра не страшная и не цепляющая. Такое чувство, что авторы не особо понимали, в чем фишка фильма. Не понимали, что они сами хотят сделать и как вызвать эмоции у игрока. Поэтому намешали в кучу бегающих монстров, идиотские головоломки с видеокамерой, ""психологические"" кат-сцены, в которых герои СЛОВАМИ объясняют, что с ними случилось в прошлом, да еще и обмазали сверху ПТСР, мол, так будет интереснее.

Но интереснее не получилось. Фильм брал своей простотой и реализмом: вот ты, а вот ночь в лесу; кто победит? Игра же запуталась сама в себе, заплутала в тех самых лесных лабиринтах и получилась довольно пресной и скучной.

Если вы не смотрели фильм и просто хотите скоротать вечерок, то могу порекомендовать эту игру. Она, по крайней мере, довольно красиво сделана. Просто не ожидайте чего-то прорывного.

First off the ok at best, not the best looking game, feels like a game that came out in 2015 graphics good. Although the light rays and where it does land is by far the best part of the graphics. I also do like the art style for the menu. trying to make it look like aselection creeen of a camecorter. along with that fikm grain from a 90s camra. Also my FPS tanks like crazy. I go from 135FPS durring the cutscenes and drops down to 25-30 FPS durring gameplay. Also I find the game weardly blury. Even with motion blur off and resetting my graphics to medim, its just blury as hell. Setting the graphics to average does boost the FPS but the graphics doesnt change a whole lot.
The game:
I do like the small stuff you can do in the game. like go threw the guys phone, play games, go threw his texts, call people. Also love bullet the dog idea where you can customize how he looks. dispite, having a pathedically small choice of options.  But so for it looks promising for the command feature for the dog. where you can command him and help you out durring gameplay. also the way you treat him effects the outcome of the game.
OMG I LOVED fighting the monsters with bullet! So their are sections where you need to fend off monsters in the forrest and bullet will bark and growel at them, and if you shine your light at them they disippear. Its a very tence moments and having bullet with you is a huge help

The story:
 So this is ment to take place after the events of the first movie in an unspecified ammount of time. Another child has gone missing. And your their with your dog to help search for him, and your a vet that needs to take his pills after that incident no one  talks about. Very fucking cheesey. Honesty it has to do more with the main character finding a serial killer who took a child, than the blair witch.

My random verdict:
It's an okay game inless you really love the blair witch. and even then its still meh. also theiur are about 6 different endings. I got the bad ending","The graphics:

I also do like the art style for the menu. trying to make it look like aselection creeen of a camecorter. along with that fikm grain from a 90s camra. Also my FPS tanks like crazy. I go from 135FPS durring the cutscenes and drops down to 25-30 FPS durring gameplay. Also I find the game weardly blury. Even with motion blur off and resetting my graphics to medim, its just blury as hell. Setting the graphics to average does boost the FPS but the graphics doesnt change a whole lot.
The game:
I do like the small stuff you can do in the game. like go threw the guys phone, play games, go threw his texts, call people. Also love bullet the dog idea where you can customize how he looks. dispite, having a pathedically small choice of options.  But so for it looks promising for the command feature for the dog. where you can command him and help you out durring gameplay. also the way you treat him effects the outcome of the game.
OMG I LOVED fighting the monsters with bullet! So their are sections where you need to fend off monsters in the forrest and bullet will bark and growel at them, and if you shine your light at them they disippear. Its a very tence moments and having bullet with you is a huge help

The story:
 So this is ment to take place after the events of the first movie in an unspecified ammount of time. Another child has gone missing. And your their with your dog to help search for him, and your a vet that needs to take his pills after that incident no one  talks about. Very fucking cheesey. Honesty it has to do more with the main character finding a serial killer who took a child, than the blair witch.

My random verdict:
It's an okay game inless you really love the blair witch. and even then its still meh. also theiur are about 6 different endings. I got the bad ending"

Dass die Regie es mit der Länge bestimmter Frustabschnitte übertreibt, ist dem Wahnsinn tatsächlich zuträglich; nach halbstündigem Im-Kreis-Laufen und zehn mal wiederholten Halluzinationen stellt sich bald echte Verzweiflung ein. Hätte man bloß auf die typischen Astmonster und lächerlichen Laub-Blobs verzichtet und uneindeutigere Gegner erdacht, hätte Blair Witch nachhaltig verängstigen können; wahrscheinlich muss man es dem Layers-of-Fear-Team anrechnen, dass sie überhaupt Gegner eingebaut haben.
Die Probleme des Waldes im Videospiel bleiben trotz der pittoresken Route bestehen; manche Äste lassen sich überklettern, andere markieren das Ende der Karte, im Dunkeln sind diese Abgrenzungen noch schwerer zu erkennen.
Die eingängliche Warnung, Ellis' Handlungen würden beobachtet und das Spielende beeinflussen, kann man getrost ignorieren, braucht es doch einige spaßlose Anstrengung um den positiven (und dabei nicht merklich positiveren) Ausgang zu erreichen. In der letzten Spielstunde im Blair Witch House schleichen wir wieder auf ganz bekannten LoF-Pfaden, das heißt, viel Freude an den visuellen Einfällen, aber wenig (An)Spannung. Gelungen ist wiederum, dass die Geschichte trotz vollkommen anderer Struktur und Narration den originalen Blair-Witch-Project-Geist so präzise einfängt und ein kleines Restmysterium um die Wälder Marylands bewahrt.",
81322137,english,2020.11.01 08:45,✅,✅,0.4945055246,0,"As a fan of horror, including the Blair Witch franchise, this game does not disappoint as an added story to the collection. Play through was rather seamless and cinematic scenes were superb. It provided many challenges that did not get repetitive unlike those in Evil Within. It also feels as if Blair Witch took note from P.T. for their final chapter which was a pleasant surprise. 

I have only minor complaints for this game. First, the inconsistency of your dog in game versus cinematic scenes. The cinematic scenes depict the default color combos, which is fine if you kept the originally intended color palette. However, as someone who loves customizable content, there is a disconnect in empathy towards the dog depicted in the cinematic scenes since you spend most of your bonding time with the game play version. Suggestion would be to either remove the option entirely, or spend time making cut scenes for each customizable option. Second would be the replay value. As is often the pitfall of story driven games, such as the likes of Until Dawn, Heavy Rain, Beyond Two Souls, Murdered: Soul Suspect etc., unless someone were a completionist, I feel most would play this game once (maybe twice some time later if they really enjoyed the story). Please note, however, these are incredibly minor drawbacks.

Overall, this has been an extremely pleasurable game that I was able to complete from download to end of game in one sitting. It is a psychological horror game at its finest and I would highly recommend playing it at least once.","As a fan of horror, including the Blair Witch franchise, this game does not disappoint as an added story to the collection.

3D恐怖，收集，多周目

[h1]游戏内容[/h1]
可使用手电筒照亮、御敌，摄像机配合录像带可用于改写世界线，摄像机还包括夜视功能，其余可使用的工具包括对讲机、手机(功能机)，用于联络[strike]和玩小游戏[/strike]。
主角有个好帮手——一条名为子弹的工作犬，可以让它协助寻找线索物品、寻路、跟随等，可以对它喂食、抚摸、训斥。

[h1]感想[/h1]
中途拿到摄像机并发现其带夜视功能的时候，本想吐槽：“抄袭《逃生》？”还好bloober从不令人失望，使用方式基本不同，并且游戏不会使用让人窘迫的电池收集来引发焦虑，玩家放心地专注于故事本身即可。本作的收集要素仅影响成就，部分影响结局，不会阻碍游戏本身流程（没收集到仍然能顺利玩到结尾）。
游戏机制上，最引人注目的部分莫过于工作犬子弹了，它能引路、能帮忙找收集物，叫声的类型提示附近是否遇到危险，它的陪伴为主角带来安心感[strike]，男主离开狗子可谓弱柳扶风，在树林里吓到站都站不住[/strike]。
本作的地图可谓非常有特色，主要由森林+房间两部分组成，大部分森林段可以依赖工作犬子弹指路，部分森林段落，譬如其中一场寻找锯木厂（？）图标的桥段中，制作组把过去自己在小房间内娴熟空间变换的本领发挥到了看似开放世界的树林中，效果十分惊喜——玩家可以体验一把“鬼打墙”，不论怎么在森林中游走都会回到原地。虽然原理并不复杂，但是体验十分自然，第一视角更具有蒙骗性。房间地图的重复更多用于展现主角的幻觉，算制作组的传统艺能，本次表现中规中矩。

关于剧情，据悉“女巫布莱尔”原是1999年出品的一部以镜头取胜的恐怖电影，讲述三名学生前往小镇调查女巫却离奇失踪的事件，以其“伪纪录片”式第一视角镜头语言征服了观众。本作虽取其名，但故事内容与电影原作并无关联，而是讲述的全新的女巫故事。
本作主线为男主进入森林协同搜索失踪男孩Peter。[spoiler]从主角各种闪回的记忆，可以拼凑起这窝囊男人的一生：孩童时似乎在森林里发生过意外，因而曾对森林抱有恐惧，精神受到创伤；到中东作为小队指挥官执行任务，由于自身的失误，导致6名属下全部丧生；自己在战斗失败惊恐逃亡中，闯入一名当地女性的房间，怕她发出声音引来敌人，用刀将其残忍杀害；退役成为警察后，在一次超市劫案出警行动中杀死了一名手无寸铁的男孩。男主的精神深受折磨，也曾想过自杀，但可能缺乏勇气，一直没有成功执行。故事中我们可以了解到，由于他的精神状态不稳定，目前和妻子的关系也处于僵持状态，很久未联系。为了弥补自己的过错，安抚自己的精神，他自告奋勇参与那名被射杀男孩的弟弟皮特的搜救行动，取走了还未到的警员安东尼的对讲机擅自加入搜索，即使妻子得知后考虑他的精神健康情况不断劝说，他也执意要继续。未曾想——这片传说中的树林真的有女巫存在，男主在女巫控制的卡弗指引下不断前进，最后根据玩家的行为，可能落入女巫的轮回，也可能打破轮回。[/spoiler]

作为一名不喜欢多周目的成就随缘玩家，目前打出的结局是俗气的堕落结局，如果要打破轮回，需要[spoiler]不杀死任何怪物，不破坏任何图腾，不收集除17章房间外的任何木头娃娃，不按女巫指令杀任何人[/spoiler]。

本作的优点是形式上的内容非常丰富，缺陷是后一半房间地图回忆零散，各种事件比较独立碎片，导致缺乏精神上一步一步加深摧残的紧迫感，单纯成了单元式体验。",

В целом качественно. Отдельно заслуживает похвалы звук, он тут на столько реалистичен и хорош что я просто получил оргазм от него. Из плюсов игры могу выделить самый главный и очевидный - наша собака Буллет. 
Из минусов могу лично для себя выделить то что с середины игры понимаешь к чем приведет одна из концовок, намеки были с самого начала игры, но все же не для всех могут быть заметны. Ну и еще минус это продолжительность, лично для меня не помешало бы еще 2-3 часа геймплея. Ну и кому как но игра мне не показалась хоррором, для меня лично это было приключение в мрачной обстановке.

You might ask now: ""But then why you gave it a positive rating?
→ Simply because I enjoyed my Time. It's not that long and it kept my interest while not be the most innovative Game. But let me start from the beginning.

After playing the game for about 2+ hours it started to get rather stale. The game starts with a goal in mind but rather quickly drifts into other topics and mashes up elements of slender man, mental horror, slasher horror etc. to try to keep itself entertaining and fresh, but it makes you feel like your playing 5 different games at once.

The game itself is not the worst, it plays well despite lot of people saying it runs poorly. I myself found it running just fine without any noticeable issues besides a few fps drops here and there. the environment and graphics overall look decent and there are some smaller elements that really shine as a unique feature like the cellphone that includes games on it and i find this to be clever and unique element.

Pro Tip: Don't forget to play Snake on your cellphone lol.

The big problem of this game is its linear rather mundane story telling. All you really do is follow a dog around as it shows you the right path while solving simple puzzles and occasionally shining a light at potential danger to ward it off and that is really all it is. The game lacks any real potential of horror.

for 29,99$ I would say: HELL NAH BUDDY, but i would probably grab it on a sale for roundabout 10$ as it really does not offer anything new to the table of horror genres but is still an enjoyable ride once and only once.","[h1] Not even a scary walking simulator that cant decide what it wants to be.

Not just from a purely aesthetic stance, but there is a lot of great visual tricks that add a unique disorienting atmosphere to the game. The sound design follows this notion too. Overall it is an absolutely state of the art experience.

The story and sense of suspense is absolutely great. Very well managed, and even the high energy moments still manage to maintain the creepy atmosphere. The way the main character's distress from their mental ailments was extremely well implemented, and the subtle aspects of the story were never too on the nose.

Pacing was definitely an issue for me at some points, A few areas had this issue to a minor degree where they just felt like they went on for longer than the suspense actually held out. But there were two worst offenders very late in the game that really killed the suspense and pacing for me, and at crucial moments at that.

As for endings, I think it slipped. Without spoiling two much, there are two main endings, with a few smaller variations based on your actions. Don't feel bad for getting the ""Bad"" ending. It's actually kind of absurd what you have to do to prevent it. You literally have to avoid doing SO many things that the game is literally telling you to do.
I take issue with that, because you are basically forced into getting the bad ending if you go in blind. Your actions ultimately don't mean very much. When you've played through once, you can study online guides on how to uncover the exceptionally well hidden conditions for the standard ""Good"" ending. I think it would have been much better if a new player could lean either way based on their attitudes. Kind of like ""Abe's Odyssey"", in that game, there is a decent chance you could get the good or bad ending, just depending on how careless you are. This is very different though. But there is a Sub-ending, and those conditions were just right for me, and made perfect sense.

Mechanics wise, this game finds some really great ways to innovate, really playing into the mysterious time splitting nature of the game. The way that mental health factors into this does also feel really interesting. I feel they could have gone deeper with it by making more non-scripted aspects to the character's mental health, but this worked for me as a story driven game.

Price, wise, it has a fairly high price tag. If you plan on replaying it for all the secrets and achievements, you'll definitely get more out of it. But I do take issue with the idea that the Price you spend on a game is only worth it if you get x hours out of it, because the 4-5 hours you'll spend on one play-through, is VERY high quality moment to moment. A game could normally make you grind your hours away, but this game is totally just back to back, great moment to moment experiences that stand out and feel really powerful. It doesn't feel repetitive (Except for the mild exceptions I mentioned earlier). This is a game that will stick with me, and I will remember it. At the end of the day, that is worth the money, and it didn't have to get me to grind and replay content for hundreds of hours to prove that to me. If you like Strong story driven games, you should buy it.

Overall, really great. A few slip ups in terms of Story and Pacing, but it is ultimately a state of the art story experience. It is expensive, but it lives up to it's price tag, not in hours played, but as a high end, and extremely memorable story with some great innovation in terms of game design and stunning visuals that contends with the highest level.","It's very good and well made.

I wonder till now, how this game could have so much positive feedback at steam? Lack of games from Blair Witch universum? Dog? Forest? Idk. 

This game is horrible. Maybe not so much at beginning, but ending? I was so tired of walking inside of that damn house for infinite loops, that I almost quit the game. They didn't have time to put that miserable story before, so they did it in the end? Making this game looking even more stupid. Is it Blair Witch or PTSD simulator? Things totally not connected with Blair Witch. 

PROS:
- Blair Witch universum
- Dog (& interactions with him)
- Forest (it looks generaly good, but background color many times is bugged)

CONS:
- Boring walking simulator
- Infinite loops (walking 20x past same location, I got the idea of confusion but pls, ffs not that crap)
- Cheap story (at least that part about Ellis)
- Short 4/5h max (few more if you want to find all the things)
- Not scary at all
- Ultra bad jump scares 
- Many unused possibilities for the game to be a good horror
- Not a Horror game, even not more Psychological Horror
- Names of children sounds too much Eastern EU, like for US&A place
- Last chapter is a kind of misunderstanding, infinite loop in the house, explaining all the stories from before, because there was no possibility to do it before(?????), one BIG FAIL.

Short summary. I heard about Blair Witch, since I was a kid, and I really like to read stories, books and play games about it (sadly not many), and of course watching movies about it too. But that games, is  a huge disappointment, first because it don't focus on main story line, only at Ellis drama story, second it is not a horror game and third how you can make happy ending in Blair Witch universum?!?!?!?","Don't buy before sales! This game is worth max 5$!!

I wonder till now, how this game could have so much positive feedback at steam? Lack of games from Blair Witch universum? Dog? Forest? Idk. 

This game is horrible. Maybe not so much at beginning, but ending? I was so tired of walking inside of that damn house for infinite loops, that I almost quit the game. They didn't have time to put that miserable story before, so they did it in the end? Making this game looking even more stupid. Is it Blair Witch or PTSD simulator? Things totally not connected with Blair Witch. 

PROS:
- Blair Witch universum
- Dog (& interactions with him)
- Forest (it looks generaly good, but background color many times is bugged)

CONS:
- Boring walking simulator
- Infinite loops (walking 20x past same location, I got the idea of confusion but pls, ffs not that crap)
- Cheap story (at least that part about Ellis)
- Short 4/5h max (few more if you want to find all the things)
- Not scary at all
- Ultra bad jump scares 
- Many unused possibilities for the game to be a good horror
- Not a Horror game, even not more Psychological Horror
- Names of children sounds too much Eastern EU, like for US&A place
- Last chapter is a kind of misunderstanding, infinite loop in the house, explaining all the stories from before, because there was no possibility to do it before(?????), one BIG FAIL.

[b] Жанр ""мокьюментари"" приходит мне в голову при упоминании, скорее, ""Паранормальных явлений"", нежели ""Ведьмы из Блэр"". Последнюю я смотрел в далёком уже 2000 году, когда ещё не был знаком с псевдодокументальным кино, поэтому ни хрена не помню. Так, в общих чертах. Тем не менее, игрушка, сделанная по мотивам известного фильма, меня заинтересовала, захотелось посмотреть, чего же такого ""наколбасили"" разработчики, что отзывы скачут от ""смешанных"" до ""очень положительных"". Обзоры тоже, разумеется, читал, но, как известно, лучше один раз поиграть самому, чем смотреть видосы на Ютубе... [/b]

[h1][b] Дайте мне автомат, и я сам пристрелю главного героя [/b][/h1]
Итак, сюжет. С ""Ведьмой из Блэр"" игра связана местом действия: события разворачиваются в 1996 году в том самом лесу, в котором два года назад пропала группа студентов, но на этом сходство и заканчивается.

Главных героев два: бывший полицейский по имени Эллис, и его пёс по кличке Буллет.  И, если с собакой всё предельно ясно - она наш лучший друг и помощник и вообще очень прикольная животинка, то вот с Эллисом дело обстоит намного печальнее.

1996 год. Неподалёку от небольшого городка Бёркетсвиль пропадает девятилетний Питер Шэннон. Именно здесь, как я уже упоминал, два года назад бесследно исчезла группа студентов, и это исчезновение успело обрасти домыслами, страшилками и разными, правдоподобными и не очень, версиями. 

На поиски мальчика отправляется группа полицейских, к которой подключается и наш герой вместе со своим верным псом, надеясь, очевидно, этим поступком искупить прошлые грехи. День тёплый и солнечный, и Эллис вместе с взявшим след Буллетом углубляются всё дальше и дальше в лес... Там, в мрачной чаще, нашему герою предстоит встреча не только с обыденными и понятными страхами, но и с тёмной стороной самого себя.

Тьфу! Аж скулы сводит, если честно. Думаю, вряд ли кого-то удивлю, если скажу, что у Эллиса проблемы в личной жизни и посттравматическое расстройство на фоне участия в боевых действиях. Ну это же просто писец какой-то! Почему 99% персонажей хорроров имеют серьёзные психологические травмы, будь то жуткое детство в старом особняке, война или гибель кого-то из близких? Почему героем ужастика нельзя сделать обычного человека с крепкой психикой и без за@бов, которому не мерещится за каждым кустом призрак трагически погибшей в детстве сестрёнки? Это клише задолбало даже больше, чем бесконечная месть в играх серии ""Assassin's Creed""! 

В общем, для меня именно Эллис свёл на нет практически все усилия разрабов, которые, очевидно, очень старались ""в сюжет"". Тем не менее, кроме нашего героя в игре есть ещё очень классный пёс, довольно неплохой геймплей и мрачная, гнетущая атмосфера. ""Blair Witch"" может зацепить хотя бы этим.

[h1][b] Ночь, тёмный лес, фонарь, собака... [/b][/h1]
Геймплейно ""Ведьма из Блэр"" больше похожа на симулятор ходьбы... хотя, почему похожа? Симулятор ходьбы как он есть.

Мы будем бродить по лесу, ориентируясь исключительно на нюх Буллета и собственную память, так что, если у вас топографический кретинизм, на первых порах будет сложно. Никакой карты, только хардкор! Но с псом было как-то... спокойнее, что ли.

Итак, мы бродим по лесу и ищем следы пропавшего ребёнка, а помогать нам в этом нелёгком деле будут:
 [list]
    [*]  [b][u] Фонарик. [/u][/b] Сей девайс предназначен для освещения местности в ночное время и для борьбы с монстрами (привет, Алан!). Монстров, правда, будет не особо много, и их можно не убивать, а обойти.

    [*] [b][u] Мобильный телефон. [/u][/b] При помощи сотового мы будем время от времени общаться с бывшей. Да и ещё паре человек можно позвонить. Кстати, не забудьте поиграть на этом динозавре в змейку.

    [*] [b][u] Рация. [/u][/b] Как и мобильный, тоже служит для связи с внешним миром, в основном, с полицейскими, ведущими поиски паренька, и... ещё кое с кем.

    [*] [b][u] Видеокамера. [/u][/b] О, это штука интересная! Во-первых, у неё есть режим ночного видения, который вполне может заменить нам фонарик, а, во-вторых, на ней можно просматривать видеозаписи. И вот тут на ""тропу войны"" выходит достаточно интересная механика, которая даёт возможность менять некоторые события в реальной жизни Эллиса. К примеру, мы подходим к огромному дереву, перегородившему дальнейший путь. Вставляем нужную кассету в камеру, просматриваем её и останавливаем запись в тот момент, когда дерево ещё спокойно себе растёт на обочине. Выключаем камеру и видим, что путь свободен. Кассеты нам будет приносить умница Буллет, а кое-какие мы найдём самостоятельно. При помощи кассет мы сможем получать новые улики, поэтому все записи нужно смотреть внимательно, дабы не пропустить ничего важного.
[/list]

Стоит также упомянуть про взаимодействие с собакой. Во-первых, если Буллет рядом, то и нашему герою хорошо, а вот в одиночестве Эллис запросто может поехать кукухой. Пса можно подозвать, погладить, поругать за что-то, дать ему понюхать найденную вещь или приказать искать интересные места. В остальном же Буллет ведёт себя, как самая обычная собака: валяется в траве, чешется или бегает кругами и лает.

Не могу не отметить, что в игре довольно много коллекционных предметов. Мы будем собирать фотографии жертв, записки психиатра, резные фигурки и мусор :D, а также ломать тотемы ведьмы. Нужно иметь в виду, что сбор предметов напрямую повлияет на финал игры, так что при сборе разного г@вна стоит спросить себя: а оно мне надо?

И, да, концовок в игре две, но выйти после первого же прохождения на хорошую вряд ли получится... впрочем, не буду спойлерить.

И последнее - о хоррор-составляющей. Не могу сказать, что всю игру бегал с потными ручонками, но в некоторых местах, особенно ночью, вздрагивать и материться приходилось. Разработчикам удалось создать тяжёлую, удушливую атмосферу неопределённости, тревоги и ожидания большой ж@пы. За это однозначно плюс.

[h1][b] Про графоний и музоний [/b][/h1]
Пара слов о визуальной части. Лес в игре очаровывает, завораживает и подавляет. Деревья, кусты, скалы, ручьи, речушки - всё смотрится просто великолепно, живо и красочно и давит на психику: мы одни в этом царстве природы, один на один с нашими страхами, и помощи ждать неоткуда. Локации, будь то разрушенный дом, старая лесопилка или же палаточный лагерь сделаны здорово и их интересно исследовать в поисках улик или коллекционных предметов. Сам же лес постоянно меняется. Вот только что было светло и нестрашно, а в следующую секунду наступила ночь, и знакомое вроде бы место преобразилось до неузнаваемости.

Звуки хороши (особенно те, которые издаёт Буллет), они умело нагнетают обстановку и отлично вписываются в происходящее на мониторе, а музыка... её надо слушать. Мало того, что в игре звучат довольно неплохие композиции, так они ещё являются своеобразными подсказками. Если трек спокойный, то можно расслабиться, если же тревожный, то нужно сжать булки и внимательно смотреть по сторонам.

[h1][b] Итог [/b][/h1]
[b] ""Blair Witch"" вызвала у меня двоякие чувства. С одной стороны бесячий главный герой, которого хотелось прибить, и странные концовки, а с другой - хорошая атмосфера, довольно неплохой, на мой взгляд, геймплей, и качественные визуал и OST. [/b]

[h1][b] Общая оценка - неплохо [/b][/h1]

[b] ""Ведьму"" рекомендую любителям атмосферных симуляторов ходьбы, собачек и фанатам первоисточника. Отправляйтесь на поиски пропавшего мальчика, но помните: если Буллет рычит на дерево, значит, за этим деревом притаилось зло. [/b]

Ich habe ein Spiel rund um das Thema ""Blair Witch"" erwartet. Bekommen habe ich x beliebiges Horror Spiel was zwar hier und da seine Momente hat aber Blair Witch hat es wenig zu tun.  Ist das Spiel dadurch gleich schlecht? Nein es ist zwar kein 1A Horror Spiel (Layers of Fear gefiel mir besser) aber ich habe schon schlechteres gespielt.  Dennoch bleibe ich enttäuscht zurück.  Dazu kommt die Tatsache...das Spiel ist sau kurz (4-5 Stunden) und einige Spiel Elemente erinnern ein an Alan Wake *hust*   Die Story selber ist ""ok"" aber auch teils Konfus irgendwie.  

Kann ich das Spiel empfehlen? Wer hier wirklich ein Blair Witch Titel erwartet...nein. Das ist auch der Grund warum ich den Titel nicht empfehlen kann. Wen das egal ist der kann durchaus sein Spaß mit den Titel haben aber man sollte es im Sale nur kaufen. 

Fazit:
Schade Schade Schade...ich warte weiter auf ein würdiges Blair Witch Spiel.

Про оригинальный фильм даже упоминать не хочется - дал возможность создания этой игры и бог с ним. Смотреть перед прохождением не стоит абсолютно - максимум, это игра дает какое-то объяснение последней сцене фильма.

Звук, атмосфера леса, взаимодействие с псом - на высоком уровне. Советую не составлять мнение по чужим отзывам, а пройти игру самому. На самом деле вполне что-то подобное могло бы быть новой частью сайлент хилла, только вместо леса был бы, собсно, СХ. И в таком случае ЕСТЕСТВЕННО всем бы зашло.",

Sobre la jugabilidad. No se pueden cambiar los controles. El perro no se calla, esta todo el juego ladrando y gimiendo. Varios bugs en el juego. El juego es completamente un simulador de apuntar con la linterna y decirle al perro por donde tengo que ir.

**********Heavy SPOILERS AHEAD, read at your own risk if you did not play the game yet**********

Walking Simulator with some good Jumpscares, good atmosphere, running around the forest hunting ghosts and a witch. Sometimes you feel lost in the environment, without twitch chat I would have been hardstucked several times, visual clues what to do next and where to go are often very minimal. 

It can be very tedious at times to actually figure out where to go next, or what to do *if* you want to proceed because map progression is hidden in a core mechanic which is not laid out clearly from the start. 

Personal story about main character, featuring posttraumatic stress disorder episodes, somehow forseeable in the long run, did not touch me mostly. Some generic ""I cant cope with my times as a soldier"" story blended into the Blair Witch/Forest scenario. 

Attention for fans about the Blair Witch mythos in general: this game does only feature small glimpses of the actual Blair Witch lore, most of the clues regarding the actual Witch and not the antagonist/protagonist WinkyFace are hidden in ""read for yourself"" scenes & documents, which is pretty sad. The last part of the game features the actual Witch House (?) as depicted in the original Blair Witch Project Movie of 1999. This part is pretty PogChamp as you finally get some ""real"" Blair experience. Wish this part would have been even longer, as it is by far the most impressive display of real horror elements combined with the Blair mythos in the game. Some very good jumpscares and clever game mechanics ahead. 

If the devs actually released a DLC that focussed more on the actual Blair Witch Lore this game has potential for a damn good 10 out of 10 horror game. In the current state its a good 7 out of 10. Big minus points for the topic focussed around the main character as its somewhat boring. Also BIG Minus for the doggo scene.

This might be the first Bloober release that I stop playing before the end. I should note I usually love horror games even ones considered ""walking sims.""

Most of the game is chasing/following your dog, Bullet, through endless loops in a dark spooky forest. I kept getting stuck in a loop not sure what event would cause the game to progress. In addition there are ""battles"" where you have to point your flashlight at the spooky branch monster otherwise you die. These didn't add any element of scariness to the game, instead they were cheesy and felt like a chore. The protagonist also has PTSD flashbacks that felt cliche and had nothing to do with Blair Witch lore. The video camera/VHS aspect was kinda cool but the fact that you have to interact with the camera at certain places in order to progress could've been omitted. Bloober seems intent on preventing natural gameplay progress with pointless obstacles in attempt to make the game somehow relate to the movie. 

I encountered a bug where I was supposed to put a fuse in a fusebox to turn on some lights but I was unable to interact with the fuse box and the fuse was missing from the it's location. I had to reload an earlier save to progress in the game. This is a pretty common bug (of many). 

I kept thinking ""when does this game get good,"" and if it's not good more than halfway through you've lost me. Other reviews say the ending of the game is even worse, though I wonder how that's even possible. Sorry Bloober team, I loved your other games but I can't recommend this one. 

TLDR: Unless you really like petting virtual dogs, running around dark spooky forests in a loop, or are obsessed with Blair Witch lore you'd be better off avoiding this game and buying one of Bloober team's better releases.","I'm 2/3rds of the way through Blair Witch.

Некая женщина жила на окраине села, и в один момент крестьяне пришли убить её по обвинению в колдовстве, тогда она скрылась в лесу и оттуда прокляла целое поселение, вызвав череду смертей, а дальше в этом округе стали исчезать люди.

В США данной страшилке посвящено довольно много произведений, сериалов и кинофильмов. В России люди явно куда прохладней относятся к данной теме. Я впервые познакомился с данной историей как раз в этой игре, и как-то отнюдь меня не заворожило.

Игра является продолжением первой части  Blair Witch Volume I: Rustin Parr (2000), и последующих двух частей.

События происходят в лесу штата Мэриленд, это малонаселенный штат, и там частенько кто-то из туристов или местных пропадает без вести или попросту теряется. Конечно, поисковые бригады, на постоянном дежурстве, ищут этих людей, и вот одним из таких участников поискового отряда и является протагонист этой игры. Чем дальше он погружается в расследование, тем хреновей ему становится. Помогает ему поисковая собака и старенький кнопочный телефон, который в лесу плохо ловит сигнал. Из-за этой собаки (овчарки) школьники развели в игре целую телегу соплей, она управляется все равно повторяющимся набором ограниченных команд навроде ""искать"", которые приносят результат лишь в моменты, когда на карте происходит нечто особенное.

Стоит сказать, что лес сделан очень хорошо. Вы в жизни бывали в лесу? Все почти так же, только нет запаха, так ощущения весьма близки. В Slender Arrival кто-то там вечно ворошился в темноте и ходил, здесь этого нет, к счастью, но есть близкие тенденции, когда вам кажется, что в лесу кто-то есть. там и вправду иногда есть NPC и у оккультных алтарей они могут и напасть на игрока. Ну кто понаставил всю эту безбожную дребедень в благословленном месте, где должны процветать зверушки божьи?..

Я не нашел в опциях никакого навигатора с маркерами пути, так что тут действительно как в глуши все приходиться делать на ощупь и без подсказок.

В процессе прохождения перед нами сбор коллекционных предметов, поиск улик, ничего в этом плане нового. Иногда кто-то может закричать на вас у какой-нибудь дрянной пентаграммы. Нервишки у вас как не шалят? В порядке? Я-то толстокожий человек, ни разу не испугался.

из очевидных плюсов:
Красивая графа...

Из недостатков, лес (увы) не бесшовный и (увы) это не  открытый мир, есть ограничение карты и слепые зоны обзора.",

В старые игры по понятным причинам не играл, а фильм 2018 года я постарался забыть как можно быстрее. Пусть ребята из Bloober Team (они же творцы Layers of Fear) ориентировались строго на неё, она всё же больше по духу к первой части. Но, к сожалению, без изъянов тут не обошлось. 

Что понравилось:
- Атмосфера - краегоугольный камень ""Ведьмы..."" и всё, что с ней связано. Огромный непроходимый лес, где днём пугающе тихо, а ночью вдали трещат ветки; постоянно ощущение, что за тобой кто-то наблюдает; кромешный мрак, где может прятаться что угодно, угнетает и погружает в происходящее с головой.
- То, что пугало в фильме - пирамида из камней, странные фигуры из веток и дерева, домик Растина Парра и дети, стоящие лицом к углу - присутствует и здесь. Поклонники серии будут в восторге. 
- Сюжет, который не пытается раскрыть что-то новое в мире ""Ведьмы..."" (и правда, ну его - ""Новой главы"" хватило с головой!), но зато играет на интриге всеми нелюбимой ""Книге Теней"" и даже заимствует оттуда важный сюжетный элемент.
- Озвучка. Обычно я на такие вещи внимания не обращаю, но здесь актёрская игра придаёт реализма происходящему.
- Пёсик. Он и компас и просто верный товарищ, отгоняющий мрачные мысли об одиночестве. Приятное дополнение к геймплею. И, кстати, отношение к нему частично влияет на финал.
- Некоторые моменты (особенно в ночном лесу) приятно удивили.
- Мелочи, вроде мобильного телефона, по которому можно звонить кому угодно и даже довести оператора в пиццерии до бешенства. А ещё можно поиграть в змейку.

Что не понравилось:
- Геймплей, которого тут почти нет. За всю игру только 2 более менее интересные загадки, да и те в духе ""найди-используй"", а вся остальная игра - тупо бродилка вперёд с редкими сценками галлюцинации. 
- Монстры, добавленные не понятно для чего и не понятно зачем. Они не страшные, битва с ними то ещё уныние, да и в лор вселенной никак не вписываются. Ах да, их ещё очень мало. Всего 3-4 битвы на всю игру.
- В игре две концовки, и чтобы получить самую плохую надо всего лишь пройти игру без задней мысли. Ладно. Но чтобы пройти на Хорошую концовку, нужно выполнить ряд вообще не очевидных вещей, про которые игра вам никогда не скажет, и догадаться об этом можно только с помощью гугла! Постоянно гладить собаку? Поддерживать отношения с женой? Забейте!
- Увы, но главный твист (в плохой концовке) угадывается аж в первых часах игры. [spoiler]А всё потому, что авторам было лень менять озвучку главному злодею. [/spoiler] 

В общем, если вам хочется атмосферного хоррора и если вы фанат фильма Ведьма из Блэр, то игра для вас. По-крайней мере видно, что разработчики до последнего старались следовать духу фильма, но вот с подачей и историей заметно оплошали. И всё же откровенным шлаком это назвать нельзя. Просто игра на раз. Не более.

Ho recuperato grazie al Game Pass di Xbox per PC acquistato ad 1 euro, un titolo che già avevo su Steam, sto parlando di Blair Witch, titolo del team polacco Bloober Team già conosciuti per Layers of Fear e Observer. Questo omaggio ai film da parte del team polacco, parla di Ellis, un ex agente di polizia devastato dai sensi di colpa che per pareggiare i conti col passato decide di partecipare alle ricerche di un bambino scomparso, Peter Shannon. ATTENZIONE SPORADICI SPOILER SULLA TRAMA.

Ho giocato questo Blair Witch di sera molto tardi al buio e con le cuffie, vi assicuro che ogni piccolo suono naturale che ci si può aspettare passeggiando per i boschi, sia di giorno che di notte, è stato qualcosa di veramente realistico. Di notte poi, la sensazione costante di non essere mai soli, di essere osservati, seguiti, ogni piccolissimo rumore amplificato, insomma ho giocato questo titolo con l’ansia costante che stesse per succedere qualcosa.

Come detto questa è la storia di Ellis, ex agente di polizia che in passato ha commesso più di un errore, non solo in servizio, ma anche durante la guerra del golfo (l’ho capito a titolo finito, ops!), infatti durante la lunga passeggiata nel bosco in compagnia di Bullet, un pastore belga addestrato, con un passato nell’unità cinofila, il nostro protagonista ha frequenti flashback su diversi momenti del suo turbolento passato.

Gli strumenti che ci accompagnano durante la storia, oltre al fedele Bullet, sono una torcia per illuminare il cammino durante le notti, un cellulare con cui Ellis comunica con l’ex moglie Jess, un walkie talkie per tenersi in contatto con la squadra di ricerca e una telecamera.

Bullet è senza ombra di dubbio l’ancora di salvezza di Ellis, infatti sin dall’inizio ci viene indicato dal gioco stesso di non allontanarci mai troppo dal nostro fedele amico se non vogliamo compromettere la sanità mentale del protagonista. Al nostro fedele amico possono essere impartiti diversi ordini tra cui: cerca, vieni qui, ecc.ecc. ma lo si può anche rimproverare, o si può premiarlo con un biscotto e un po’ di sane coccole.

Il cellulare invece ci è servito a comunicare con l’ex moglie di Ellis, Jess, e a ricevere messaggi anche quando non c’era segnale, per un susseguirsi di eventi che non vi spiego nel dettaglio perchè altrimenti vi levo la curiosità di giocarlo se mai ne aveste voglia!

Il walkie talkie ci ha tenuto in contatto fino ad un certo punto della storia con la squadra di ricerca del piccolo Peter, mentre la torcia ovviamente ci ha tenuti al “sicuro” di notte.

La telecamera invece mi è servita con le cassette di colore rosso che ho trovato sparse durante il gioco. Quelle di questo colore hanno infatti la particolarità (strana!) che nel riavvolgere il nastro ci consentono di manipolare il tempo! Mettendole in pausa ad esempio, in un determinato punto, ci permettono di aprire una porta chiusa, di alzare un tronco caduto che ci ostruisce il passaggio, e così via. 

Nonostante il contesto suggestivo, con i suoni perfettamente ricreati, in un ambiente come il bosco riescono a trasmettere quel senso di smarrimento, ansia e incertezza ad ogni passo, la storia sul finale perde secondo me tanti punti.

Ovviamente come mi aspettavo questa è una storia cupa, un percorso psicologico che invece di rendere il nostro Ellis libero da ogni senso di colpa che si porta dietro ormai da tempo, lo trascina sempre di più in un turbine di pazzia dilagante, risucchiandolo in un vortice che finisce per farlo sprofondare in un’abisso senza ritorno.

Ho apprezzato molto la storia di base di questo titolo, avendo giocato sia Layers of Fear che Observer mi aspettavo tutto quello che è successo, mi aspettavo che uscisse fuori la pazzia, che si andasse a scavare in profondità nella mente di un’uomo finito, distrutto dai terribili sensi di colpa, con un disturbo post traumatico, di conseguenza inaffidabile, fragile e disorientato.

Quello che mi ha un po’ deluso e non mi aspettavo invece è il finale, che si svolge tutto in una vecchia casa che continua a cambiare, un po’ come le scale in Harry Potter (“alle scale piace cambiare” cit.), troppo lungo, tedioso fare e rifare lo stesso percorso anche se ad ogni passaggio la casa cambia, sicuramente quella parte va a sottolineare il punto di non ritorno di Ellis, la pazzia che prende il sopravvento e spegne ogni speranza di redenzione, allontanandolo dalla realtà ad ogni passaggio. In ogni caso andava decisamente accorciata.

Brutti anche i bug che ho visto quando Bullet si metteva a cuccia con il tronco degli alberelli più piccoli che compenetravano il cane.

Il titolo non mi è dispiaciuto, perchè ripeto, giocato in cuffia di notte al buio l’ansia con tutti i suoni presenti nel bosco, ma anche nella casa (dove la pseudo strega si è materializzata in un certo senso), mi hanno fatta giocare con una certa tensione, che in determinati momenti è sfociata in veri e propri coccoloni da paura! Peccato per il finale troppo lungo e tedioso, girellare in una casa che cambia come le scale di HP per allungare un brodo che poteva sicuramente essere evitato e per i bug di compenetrazione che lo penalizzano un po’, ma nonostante tutto ve lo consiglio, magari lo potete recuperare con il Game Pass per PC a 1 euro per il primo mese, oppure acquistatelo su Steam.

[i][b]«Ведьма из Блэр» – пожалуй, самый запутанный для меня фэндом. Я не смотрел фильмы целиком, т.к. с трудом перевариваю мокьюментари, а из обзоров на них понял не так много. Однако игру все же решил купить, т.к. люблю поиграть в хороший хоррор, к тому же у меня оставалась надежда, что, может быть, хотя бы она мне все объяснит.

Интерес подогревало и то, что вместо любопытных студентов, которым нечем заняться, главными героями выступают коп Эллис и его собака. Да и в лес они пришли со вполне конкретной целью – найти пропавшего ребенка. Отличная концепция, немного заезженная, конечно, но зато ее сложно испортить! Ведь так?

Как оказалось, сложно, но можно :) [/b] [/i]

В игре есть [b]несколько второстепенных «сюжетных линий»[/b], каждая из которых затрагивает совершенную Эллисом подлость. В сумме они образуют причину его психического отклонения (да-да, наш главный герой немного не в себе, все как обычно). И вот тут всплывает главный минус игры – она все время скачет с одной линии на другую, временами полностью забивая на основную -  ту, что про поиски Питера. Из-за этого порой сложно понять, что вообще происходит – на вас вываливают тонну флэшбэков, за одним непонятным событием почти сразу следует другое, места действия сменяют друг друга с бешенной скоростью… И хотя в конце все более-менее объясняется, понять, что и как работает в этом чeртoвoм лесу не представляется возможным. 

[b]Я так и не понял: [/b]
[list]
[*]Если лес проверяет Эллиса на человечность, то почему он может не пройти эту проверку (плохая концовка), если банально не совершает ничего плохого за весь сюжет? 
[*]Кто этот лесник, который тусуется в этом лесу уже несколько лет? 
[*]Откуда у обычной ведьмы такая власть над этим местом? 
[*]От чего зависит то, поймает тебя лес в свою «ловушку» или нет? 
[*]Почему камера способна изменять реальность?
[/list]
Причем игра как бы дает ответы на эти вопросы, но настолько туманно и размыто, что остается только додумать половину самому. Я не из тех, кто любит гадать, что было на уме у автора, посему для меня это огромный минус.

Если говорить о [b]технической части[/b], то игра выполнена в лучших традициях Unreal Engine – идеальная картинка, множество деталей и отличная оптимизация. Багов замечено не было, хотя упираться в невидимые стены иногда было неприятно.

Также в игре [b]огромное количество разномастных механик и головоломок[/b], которые, тем не менее, довольно просты. Проблемой является скорее то, что с первого взгляда невозможно понять, что игра считает «плохим» поступком, а что «злым». Порой не сразу понимаешь даже, что где-то можно поступить иначе. Сломал знак из гoвнa и палок, на который агрится собака – минус к карме, пощупал деревянного истукана – минус, «засветил» монстра, который хотел тебя убить – минус, запустил собаку в подозрительную нору – что? Тоже минус. Ну, прямо в лучших традициях Metro 2033 сделано – без прохождения бегаешь по игре, как по минному полю. Не надо так.

[b]Геймплейно – это обычный коридор[/b] в стиле Outlast’a. Разве что механик больше, чем банальное ПНВ. Командовать собакой, искать мусор, отбиваться от монстров, искать знаки и подсказки – все это так и не смогло мне надоесть,  благо игра очень коротка. А вот что надоело – так это последний уровень с домом, ходить по которому было просто до ужаса скучно. Я молил всех богов, чтобы за следующей дверью был выход из этой халупы. Казалось, я пробегал по ней часа два…

[i][b]Почему же отзыв положительный? Ну, стоит сказать, что играть было по большей части приятно и интересно. Этакое небольшое приключения за вполне адекватную цену (брал по скидке). Даже не смотревшему ничего по «Ведьме», будет, над чем поразмыслить и на что посмотреть. Да и атмосфера какая-никакая присутствует, хотя для меня игра страшной и не была.

Рекомендую.",

That being said, the game is not even remotely worth the normal $30 asking price. I'm actually shocked by the amount of good reviews. The game is a walking simulator. There's no open world exploration aspect to it, you stick to a pretty linear route, and because of that the game's only about 6 hours long. No 6 hour game should ever charge $30. Saddest thing is probably 30-60 min of that is made up of endless loop areas where you simply have to keep moving at a snails pace until the game lets you advance. This does NOTHING to help the mood of the game and ruins any slight tension that may have built; twice I had to walk away from my PC in the middle of these parts just to break the monotony because I was bored out of my mind.

There's not many scares, there's not a good story, there's not even a mention of the Blair Witch through 99% of the game, so the game being titled that is pretty much 'clickbait' so-to-speak to try and lure in horror fans to buy this over other similar games available that are even more creepy and fun. Like I said, if the game is super discounted to $7 or below again, you might as well try since even if you dislike it like I did, you didn't waste too much money... but there's no way in a million years I could recommend this slow, short game for $30.","I'll preface by saying, if the games on sale for the $7.50 I got it for, you might as well try it.

Overall, as a huge fan of the original film, I believe this is an excellent take on a new story set in the Blair Witch universe.","Really well done story.

Cons :

1)Relatively short

Buy this game if you like atmospheric horror games. Due to its short gameplay, i wouldn't recommend a full price, but definitely take it on sales.","Very well made game. It played nicely on my potato.

Der Sound, der tierische Begleiter (1+ mit Sternchen), der Wald, alles sehr schön gemacht. Und je weiter man spielt, desto gruseliger wird es! Der letzte Part hatte es in sich!

 Игра сама всё за меня решила. До этого момента меня сильно коробило от топорности всех механик и сырости проработки геймплея. Логика пса очевидно очень бесячая, многие переходы в анимациях грубые, движения персонажа надрывные. Единственное что прекрасно реализовано в этой игре так это лес, он очень красиво сделан с визуальной точки зрения. Но есть нюанс.... :D
С точки зрения интерактивности и левел дизайна это провал. Здоровые ветки через которые ты можешь прошагать и невидимые стены... привет начало 2000х.
