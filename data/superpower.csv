204780987,polish,2025.08.20 17:33,❌,❌,0.5217391253,1,"[b]SuperPower 3[/b] to niestety ogromne rozczarowanie oraz całkowity bubel ze strony technicznej, współcześnie uformowana wersja klasycznego tytułu z gatunku gier strategicznych (globalny geopolityczny symulator), bazującej na prawdziwych danych z różnych sfer poszczególnych krajów, dający graczowi możliwość zarządzania i działania na arenie międzynarodowej jednym z dowolnie wybranym przez siebie, realnie odwzorowanym państwem – walcząc z innymi o dominację nad światem.

Tytuł z pewnością nie jest dla każdego zwłaszcza w tym stanie jaki ukazuje, to mocno rozbudowana strategia dedykowany głównie fanom poprzedniczek w tym gier strategicznym nastawionych na zarządzanie całym państwem w warstwie politycznej, ekonomicznej i militarnej – co wcale nie jest takim prostym zadaniem jakby można było sobie to wyobrazić. Jeżeli sądzicie że operowanie nawet najpotężniejszym mocarstwem jest wystarczające aby podbić z łatwością cały świat  - to jesteście w błędzie. 

To co całkowicie dobija oddanego fana serii SuperPower widząc najnowsza wersję to to że prócz warstwy graficznej, zmodyfikowanego interfejsu to tak naprawdę nic nie zmieniło się na lepsze. Moja ekscytacja widząc zapowiedź kolejnej części była ogromna, lecz całkowicie zniknęła kiedy zaczynacie w nią grać – bubel techniczny, w którym mało co w ogóle działa to najdelikatniejsze określenie tego co otrzymujecie. Grać oczywiście można, aczkolwiek to przygoda dla osób z mocnymi nerwami i silną wolą, która będzie wielokrotnie testowana w jej trakcie. 

Fundamentalne systemy w grze nie działają, przez co nawet jeżeli stworzycie „złotem płynące utopijne państwo przebijające wszystko i wszystkich na planecie, bez podatków, z maksymalnym wsparciem rządu na wszystko, to i tak ono z czasem upadnie”, przy czym światowe „zadupia” z ujemnym balansem rozwijają się w najlepsze… (!?). Do tego piętrzące się błędy, mogące wyskoczyć w każdym momencie, wyłączając grę/zacinając ją na stałe, usuwając wam ważny zapis rozgrywki itd. Po pewnym dłuższym momencie nawet najwytrwalsi mówią dosyć, lepiej przerzucić się na inne produkcie z tej kategorii nie marnując czasu i nerwów – bo nie oto chodzi w grach.

Co gorsza, twórca gry najwyraźniej zrobił to samo bo od 2022 roku do teraz nie zrobili nic aby połatać ten tytuł – potocznie go porzucili, pokazując środkowy palec wszystkim tym którzy im zaufali płacąc za ich produkt astronomiczną cenę na Steam dostając w zamian grę we wczesnej fazie produkcji.

Szczerze odradzam zakup, a jeżeli jakimś cudem zapragniecie przetestować jej growe walory to zachęcam spojrzeć na strony internetowe zewnętrznych oficjalnych sklepów z grami cyfrowymi – tam możecie zakupić klucz/subskrypcję za dosłowny ułamek tej ceny (ja tak zrobiłem). 


[quote]Zachęcam wszystkich do obserwacji [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32785706/ ]kuratora[/url], by na bieżąco otrzymywać świeże informacje o nowo zrecenzowanych tytułach.[/quote]","[b]SuperPower 3[/b] is unfortunately a huge disappointment and a complete technical failure. It's a modernized version of a classic strategy game (a global geopolitical simulator), based on real data from various spheres of individual countries, giving players the opportunity to manage and operate on the international stage with a freely chosen, realistically reproduced country – battling others for world domination.

The title certainly isn't for everyone, especially in its current state. It's a highly complex strategy game aimed primarily at fans of its predecessors, including strategy games focused on managing an entire country politically, economically, and militarily – which isn't as simple a task as you might imagine. If you think that operating even the most powerful superpower is enough to easily conquer the entire world, you're wrong.

What completely depresses a devoted SuperPower fan upon seeing the latest version is that, aside from the graphics and the modified interface, nothing has really changed for the better. My excitement when I saw the announcement of the next installment was immense, but it completely vanished when you started playing it – a technical mess where hardly anything works at all is the mildest description of what you get. You can play, of course, but it's an adventure for those with strong nerves and a strong will, which will be tested repeatedly throughout.

The game's fundamental systems don't work, so even if you create a ""gold-flooded utopian state that trumps everything and everyone on the planet, with no taxes, and maximum government support for everything, it will still collapse over time,"" while the world's ""shallow ends"" with negative balance continue to flourish... (!?). On top of that, bugs pile up, capable of popping up at any moment, shutting down the game/freezing it permanently, deleting important saves, and so on. After a while, even the most persistent say enough is enough. It's better to switch to another product in this category without wasting time and energy – because that's not what games are about.

Worse still, the game's creator has apparently done the same thing, as they haven't done anything to patch this title since 2022 – they've essentially abandoned it, giving a thumbs-up to those who trusted them by paying an astronomical price on Steam for their product, only to receive a game in early development.

I strongly advise against purchasing it, and if by some miracle you decide to test its gameplay, I encourage you to check out the websites of official third-party digital game stores – you can buy a key/subscription there for a fraction of the price (which is what I did).

204071105,brazilian,2025.08.11 14:10,❌,✅,0.5,0,"Eu comprei! Mas tenho uma lista enorme de reclamações!
Sei que não da pra fazer um jogo para cada jogador, mas é o seguinte, o Superpower 2 foi um baita jogo e iniciou a franquia, o 3 ao que parece, é apenas uma copia mais complexa do 2.

Você basicamente não tem controle sobre muitos aspectos da ""sociedade"", o que te coloca com apenas 2 missões básicas, ganhar dinheiro e comprar exércitos para invadir os amiguinhos.

Você poderia até pensar que os mecanismos de subversão, os tratados e as opções ""socioeconomicas"" seriam mais dinâmicas e inteligentes, mas não, não são.

Você tem ainda menos controle sobre sua economia (além de ter se tornado muito complexo sem necessáriamente você ter vantagens ou criar coisas novas), você tem ainda menos controle sobre tratados, ainda menos controle sobre operações  secretas, ainda menos controle sobre a sociedade, tudo isso sem grandes evoluções em relação a inteligência do jogo de modo geral.

Virou uma espécie de RISK aprimorado com sliders que não servem para muita coisa além gerar mais carga de microgerenciamento que no fim do jogo, não te traz grandes vantagens nem traz possibilidades novas de interação com o jogo, como ser palco da proxima grande revolução tecnologica, se tornar centro cultural, difundir sua cultura mundo afora, enfim, não adianta nem citar porque nada disso é possível no jogo de qualquer maneira.

Espero que melhorem muito o jogo, pois tem potencial, e por favor! SIMPLIFIQUEM as telas de gestão!","I bought it! But I have a huge list of complaints!

I know you can't make a game for every player, but here's the thing, Superpower 2 was a great game and started the franchise, the 3rd one, it seems, is just a more complex copy of the 2nd.

You basically have no control over many aspects of ""society,"" which leaves you with only 2 basic missions: earn money and buy armies to invade your friends.

You might even think that the subversion mechanisms, treaties, and ""socioeconomic"" options would be more dynamic and intelligent, but no, they aren't.

You have even less control over your economy (besides it becoming very complex without necessarily giving you advantages or creating new things), you have even less control over treaties, even less control over secret operations, even less control over society, all without significant evolution in the game's overall intelligence.

It's become a kind of enhanced RISK with sliders that don't serve much purpose other than generating more micromanagement burden. In the end, it doesn't offer significant advantages or new possibilities for interaction with the game, such as becoming the stage for the next great technological revolution, becoming a cultural center, spreading your culture worldwide—in short, there's no point in even mentioning it because none of that is possible in the game anyway.

I hope they greatly improve the game, because it has potential, and please! SIMPLIFY the management screens!"

199033900,russian,2025.06.05 21:07,✅,✅,0.5305832624,3,"Superpower 2 — это моя юность. Ставишь коммунизм в Канаде, объявляешь войну Австралии, и всё это с интерфейсом, который понимаешь с первого взгляда. Весело, просто, без лишнего гемора.
🧠 А потом выходит Superpower 3. Да, не такой удобный, местами сырой, с интерфейсом как будто для магистров экономики. Но знаете, если немного вникнуть — начинает затягивать. Тут больше фишек, больше настроек, и мир реагирует по-новому. Не всё работает идеально, но видно, что старались сделать глубже.
📈 Меня радует, что разработчики не бросили игру — фиксят, улучшают, добавляют контент. И в этой сырой оболочке прячется потенциал. Если ты фанат SP2 и готов чуть потерпеть — SP3 начинает дарить похожие ощущения. Не через 5 минут, а через пару часов.
💬 Вывод: Да, SP3 — сложнее и пока не идеальна, но это не «говно», как все кричат. Это шанс на что-то классное. Надо просто дать ей немного времени и любви.
","Superpower 2 was my youth. You set up communism in Canada, declare war on Australia, and all this with an interface that's easy to understand at first glance. Fun, simple, and without unnecessary hassle.
🧠 And then Superpower 3 comes out. Sure, it's not as user-friendly, a bit rough around the edges in places, with an interface that feels like it belongs in an economics major. But you know, if you dig in a little, it starts to draw you in. There are more features, more settings, and the world reacts in a new way. Not everything works perfectly, but it's clear they tried to make it deeper.
📈 I'm glad the developers haven't abandoned the game—they're fixing it, improving it, adding content. And there's potential hidden within this crude shell. If you're a fan of Superpower 2 and willing to put in a little patience, Superpower 3 starts to feel similar. Not after 5 minutes, but after a couple of hours.
💬 Conclusion: Yes, Superpower 3 is more difficult and not perfect yet, but it's not the ""crap"" everyone's calling it. This is a chance for something great. You just need to give her some time and love."

Мне кажется, что интерфейс был не для телефонов, а просто чтобы современно всё выглядело. 2 часть это интерфейс-калькулятор, а третья интерфейс-современность. В целом даже более интуитивно понятный, чем во 2 части. Ещё баги есть, например иногда пропадает интерфейс в начале выбора страны, и интерфейс сохранения. Из-за чего игру приходится перезагружать. 

Вот перечень больших багов игры на данный момент:

1) Если в секторе экономики поставить общественный статус, вручную поставить импорт, и обратно вернуть в частный статус. То можно в начале игры иметь любое количество доходов. Например в начале игры я играя за Бурунди поставил максимум импорта туризма. После чего поменял на частный сектор. Доход был 3 триллиона долларов. То есть в сотни раз больше ВВП страны. Критический баг, ломающий всю экономику. 

2) После загрузки сохранения, навсегда слетает аватар президента. Более того, не получается сохранить имя президенту. Из-за чего все президенты всегда с одним именем. Вообще повторная загрузка игры как будто ломает игру. Старт почти нормальный, но дальше ужас. 

3) Если начать создание армии, и перезайти в игру, то создание армии багуется. Из-за чего приходится отменять процесс.

4) Игра всё делает с задержкой. 

5) Танки и вертолёты спокойно ходят по океану. 

6) После аннексии страны, война с ней не прекращается. И она всегда висит как противник в интерфейсе. Хотя ни территорий, ни армии у неё нет. И было сообщение об аннексии.

Ещё можно добавить, что авто save бесят. Зачем после каждого выхода из игры делать новый авто save? Они там копятся, и потом приходится их удалять. Нужно сделать галочку, которая запрещает авто save. И чтобы все авто save сохранялись в один save.

И опция оккупации регионов вообще не удобный. Нет опции ""оккупировать все регионы"" из-за чего каждый регион нужно по отдельности требовать. Это скучно.

В общем задумка игры хорошая, но огромное количество багов просто критически мешает играть.","The game isn't as scary as it's made out to be. If you haven't played Part 2, then getting to know Part 3 won't be as painful. I think the interface wasn't designed for phones, but simply to give everything a modern look. Part 2 was a calculator interface, while Part 3 is a modern interface. Overall, it's even more intuitive than Part 2. There are still some bugs, for example, the interface sometimes disappears when you start selecting a country, as does the save interface, which forces you to restart the game.

Here's a list of the game's major bugs at the moment:

1) If you set the economy sector to public, manually set imports, and then change it back to private, you can have any amount of income at the beginning of the game. For example, at the beginning of the game, playing as Burundi, I set tourism imports to maximum. Then I changed it to private. The income was $3 trillion. That is, hundreds of times more than the country's GDP. A critical bug that breaks the entire economy.

2) After loading a save, the president's avatar disappears permanently. Moreover, I can't save the president's name. Because of this, all presidents always have the same name. In fact, reloading the game seems to break the game. The start is almost normal, but then it's terrible.

3) If I start creating an army and then reload the game, the army creation process is buggy. Because of this, I have to cancel the process.

4) The game does everything with a delay.

5) Tanks and helicopters navigate the ocean without any problems.

6) After annexing a country, the war with it never ends. And it always appears as an enemy in the interface, even though it has neither territories nor an army. And there was a message about the annexation.

I should also add that the auto-saves are annoying. Why do I have to create a new auto-save every time I exit the game? They accumulate there, and then I have to delete them. I need to enable a checkbox that disables auto-saves, so that all auto-saves are saved into one save.

And the option to occupy regions is completely inconvenient. There's no ""occupy all regions"" option, so you have to claim each region individually. It's boring.

Overall, the game's concept is good, but the sheer number of bugs makes it incredibly difficult to play."

J'ai regarder beaucoup de gameplay sur youtube avant de l'acheter principalement a cause de l'avalanche d'avis négatif et les joueurs sont en général trop stupide pour comprendre le fonctionnement du jeux.

De ce que j'ai pu voir c'est exactement pareil que superpower 2 sauf que les champs de batailles sont présenté différemment, on a la possibilité d'oppresser sa population, la production de ressource ainsi que le commerce a complètement été retravailler ce qui rend le jeux plus intéressant. Les IA sont beaucoup plus réactives, elles produisent des unités, annexe des territoires...etc...etc La stabilité est devenue un point encore plus important. La nouvelle interface qui comprend moins de texte et plus de graphique nous donne une meilleur idée de l'impacte de nos décisions, par exemple si vous décidez d'investir dans une ressource agricole un graphique vous indique la population disponible pour ce secteur ainsi que la quantité de terre arable, puis le résultat de votre investissement.
L’amélioration des unités est beaucoup mieux pensé, on a plus la possibilité de construire un tank pourri qui ressemble a un char Leclerc, le skin du véhicule sera automatiquement en accord avec ses spécificités, on peut même amélioré l'infanterie et ainsi créer des bataillons spécialisées dans tel ou tel domaine, ce qui nous offre comme opportunité de contenir un ennemi beaucoup plus puissant avec une armée moins chère en prenant l'avantage du terrain. Donc on peut se defendre et contenir un pays comme la chine avec un petit pays sans forcement dépenser des milliard dans son armée.     

Le gros problème de ce jeux est qu'il souffre d'un gros soucis de finition, au bout d'un moment ça lag tellement que aucune de vos actions ne prennent effet ou l'interface qui ne répond plus ce qui devient assez rapidement pénible et frustrant, le jeux n'a pas bénéficier de mis a jour depuis un bon moment et a l'air d'avoir été laissé a l'abandon. 

Même si je me suis fait rembourser je met un avis positif pour encourager les devs, ce jeux a besoins d'une bonne maj technique.","Basically, it's Superpower 2 with less text, more graphics, and new gameplay mechanics. I watched a lot of gameplay videos on YouTube before buying it, mainly because of the avalanche of negative reviews, and the players are generally too clueless to understand how the game works.

From what I've seen, it's exactly the same as Superpower 2, except the battlefields are presented differently. You have the option to oppress your population, and resource production and trade have been completely reworked, making the game more interesting. The AI ​​is much more responsive; it produces units, annexes territories, and so on. Stability has become even more important. The new interface, with less text and more graphics, gives us a better idea of ​​the impact of our decisions. For example, if you decide to invest in an agricultural resource, a graph shows you the population available for that sector, the amount of arable land, and then the result of your investment.

Unit upgrades are much better designed. You can no longer build a crappy tank that looks like a Leclerc; the vehicle's skin will automatically reflect its specific characteristics. You can even upgrade infantry and create battalions specializing in particular areas. This gives you the opportunity to hold off a much more powerful enemy with a cheaper army by taking advantage of the terrain. So, you can defend yourself and contain a country like China with a small nation without necessarily spending billions on your army.

The major problem with this game is its poor polish. After a while, it lags so much that none of your actions register, or the interface becomes unresponsive, which quickly becomes annoying and frustrating. The game hasn't received an update in quite some time and seems to have been abandoned.

Even though I got a refund, I'm leaving a positive review to encourage the developers. This game desperately needs a significant technical update."

I purchased this game the day it came out, and i was quite disappointed.
I did not get a refund because i was hoping this game would have been patched enough to be playable, and a few months after release it was abandoned instead. 
It wasn't just review bombed either... it was review nuked into oblivion on day one, even most of the ""positive"" reviews are sarcastic.

For what few people might still play or buy this game, there is a beta branch which is slightly more playable and slightly less buggy than the normal branch, but i don't think anything for this game has been updated since January 2023.

I'm going to split this into two parts, things i like, and things i don't like.
* marks what i think is a feature, but could be a bug, ** marks an obvious bug. 

Things I like:
1. The world looks nice (when it isn't bugging out and pixelating itself)
2. The RTS control of units, and being able to actually see your units.
3. The Airports, Aircraft Carriers and Ports add a layer of realism by separating Air units from Land units, but you also can use 
carriers as mobile airbases.
4. **Economic Failure seems impossible now.

Things i don't like:
1. * Character Creation in a strategy game, which makes the game feel like a Sims game with geopolitical elements.
2. ** The many many bugs still unfixed.
3. THQ pulling the plug on SP3. 
4. * Nuclear missiles act like they're from a cartoon, a small black cone or something would be more appropriate, and would allow for many more warheads to be launched at the same time. 
(SP2 was actually more realistic despite it's age, especially with it's quantity of nuclear weapons.)
5. * Strategic warfare seems actually quite tedious compared to what it was in SP2.
6. * The latency of commands given to units, which only grows the larger your military and lower your tech level is.
7. ** The globe, provinces, and countries eventually pixelating themselves, making the game session unplayable.
8. * Conflict zones seem like entirely separate areas, and units don't seamlessly move in and out of those areas.
9. * Building you military is very tedious as there isn't a queue system like in SP2, you have to build one type of unit at a time, and they take an excessively long time to produce.

There are probably more things i could add but i won't.

There's no tutorial after logging in, so I have absolutely no idea what to do. I've played nearly 2000 hours of Paradox Interactive games before even trying this. The economy section is completely incomprehensible, even though each section has very detailed explanations. The localization is only half complete, which is a minor issue; the icons are present, so it's barely functional. A lot of the data seems to reflect the publisher's bias, like the map, which is just awful to look at.

Aktuell gibt es immer wieder Abstürze, das verstellen von Reglern lagt(Aber deutlich besser als vor dem ersten Patch), Wer einen Einheitendesigner wie in SP2 erwartet den muss ich auch enttäuschen, Gebiete Können ebenfalls nicht mehr Getauscht werden und Generell fehlt hier irgendwie dieses nennen wir es mal ""Versinken"" in einer eigenen Welt.

Ob dieses Spiel bei mir je die knapp 800 Stunden von Superpower 2 bei mir erreichen wird  ? Nein, nicht in diesesem Zustand und ich muss leider wirklich sagen das es mir als Publisher peinlich gewesen wäre das Spiel so unfertig auf den Markt zu bringen, Fehler passieren natürlich jedem keine Frage, am Release Tag hatte man jedoch den Eindruck es gab keine Beta Spieler anders lässt sich aus meiner Sicht nicht erklären wie das passieren konnte.

Derzeit definitiv keine Kaufempfehlung so leit es mir tut.

Nachtrag 01.11.23: Das Spiel ist Tot, im Januar wurde das letzte Update Ausgespielt und es kann noch immer keine Rede von einem Fertigen Spiel sein. Ich rate hiermit definitiv vom Kauf ab.","I'd love to say the game is like Superpower 2, only prettier and with more content, but that would simply be a lie.

Currently, there are frequent crashes, adjusting sliders lags (though it's significantly better than before the first patch), and I have to disappoint anyone expecting a unit designer like in SP2. Territories can no longer be traded, and overall, there's a lack of that immersive experience, let's call it ""sinking into"" a world.

Will this game ever reach the nearly 800 hours I put in Superpower 2? No, not in its current state, and I have to say, as a publisher, I would have been embarrassed to release the game in such an unfinished state. Mistakes happen, of course, no question, but on release day, it seemed like there were no beta testers. I can't explain how this could have happened any other way.

I'm sorry to say I definitely can't recommend it at this time.

I'm currently not recommending it. Update November 1, 2023: The game is dead. The last update was released in January, and it's still far from being a finished game. I definitely advise against buying it."

Anfänger geeignet sei wollte ich das ganze mal ausprobieren.

Was mich allerdings erwartet hat, war ein komplett unfertiges Spiel, was weder ordentlich erklärt, was zu tun ist, noch entspricht es den Screenshots, die das Angebliche in Game Foottage belegen sollen.

Bis ich dann selbst mal ein bisschen rumprobiert habe, um zu verstehen, welcher Schieberegler welche Auswirkungen in was für einer Zeitspanne verursacht, waren dann leider die 2 Stunden Spielzeit schon überschritten, was ich im Nachgang leider stark bereut habe, da ich nun die 30 € gnadenlos verbrannt habe für so einen Scam.

Grundsätzlich bin ich immer jemand der Spielen auch nochmal eine zweite Chance gibt und später nochmal reinschaut um zu sehen, wie sich das ganze entwickelt hat. Aber bei diesem Spiel finde ich es einfach dreist so etwas Unfertiges auf den Markt zu hauen und wir sprechen in diesem Fall nicht von einem Early Access Titel wo ich vollkommen fine bin, wenn da mal was noch nicht fertig ist oder nicht richtig funktioniert.

Echt verrückt, dass ein so großer Publisher so etwas unterstützt, ich denke, das war dann auch die erste und letzte Zusammenarbeit bei den Bewertungen hier auf Steam schon alleine.

Im Großen und Ganzen KEINE Kaufempfehlung und schon gar nicht für Leute, die in dieses Genre einsteigen, wollen, denn nach zwei, drei Dingen, die einem kurz erklärt werden ist, man auch schon komplett auf sich allein gestellt. Ah doch Moment es gibt einen Verweis auf eine englische Seite, welche im Romanformat das Spiel und die Spielprinzipen erklärt, mit den Möglichkeiten der heutigen Spiele hat das aber leider mal so gar nichts zu tun ""Excuse me wir haben 2022!""…

Ich habe auch zuletzt einfach nicht mehr reingeschaut es mag ein paar Updates gegeben haben, aber nach so einer Pleite zum Start werde ich mich auch in der nächsten Zeit nicht mehr mit dem Spiel befassen.

Cheers","I was really excited to try this kind of game (I'd never actually played this genre before), and since the description said it was suitable for newcomers and beginners, I wanted to give it a go.

However, what I found was a completely unfinished game that didn't properly explain what to do, nor did it match the screenshots that were supposed to prove the game's contents.

By the time I'd experimented a bit myself to figure out which slider had what effect and over what timeframe, I'd already exceeded the two-hour playtime limit, which I deeply regretted afterward, as I'd now wasted €30 on such a scam.

Generally, I'm someone who always gives games a second chance and checks back later to see how things have developed. But with this game, I find it simply outrageous to release something so unfinished, and we're not talking about an Early Access title here, where I'm perfectly fine with things not being quite finished or not working properly.

It's truly insane that such a large publisher supports something like this. I think this was the first and last collaboration, judging by the reviews here on Steam.

All in all, I absolutely DO NOT recommend buying it, and certainly not for people who want to get into this genre, because after a couple of things that are briefly explained, you're completely on your own. Oh wait, there's a link to an English website that explains the game and its mechanics in a novel format, but unfortunately, it has absolutely nothing to do with the possibilities of today's games. ""Excuse me, it's 2022!""...

I haven't even bothered to check it out lately. There may have been a few updates, but after such a disastrous launch, I won't be dealing with the game again anytime soon.

Cheers"

일단 살해 후 이 게임을 부분유료화와 뽑기로 가득한 멀티플레이 위주의 온라인 게임으로 내놓기위한 실험용으로 내놓은 것이 아닐까 하는 생각마저 듭니다. 

지금 수시로 내놓는 패치로 어찌어찌 해결하려는 것 같지만 눈에 띄는 개선은 거의 찾을 수 없을 정도로 절망적입니다. 
한글화도 차라리 유저들이 한데모여 한글화하는게 나을지경입니다. 번역도 엉망이고, 몇몇은 영어가 그대로 나옵니다. 

UI, 그래픽을 비롯한 이 게임의 모든 것들이 깔끔하게 최적화되지 않았습니다. 느리고 버벅대는 것이 일상이고, 자원을 너무 잡아먹습니다. 슈퍼파워라는 게임이 핵무기를 상상이상으로 날리지 않는 이상 이렇게까지 사양잡아먹는 게임이 아닐텐데 말이죠. 물론 엔디비아 GTX 1070, 8GB에 DDR3 시스템 메모리 16GB, AMD FX8300 쿼드코어, SSD 256 2개라는 시대에 뒤떨어진 시스템에서 게임을 돌리는 것도 있겠지만, 이건 아닙니다. 

게다가 전투/외교/정치/무역/무기연구 분야의 편리하고 섬세한 설정이 퇴보되거나 사실상 없고, 이걸 AI 자동으로 맡겨놓을지 사용자가 직접결정할지 고를 수 있는 전작 2편의 기능도 없으니, 영토규모가 크거나 전쟁으로 얻은 영토를 병합할때 번거롭습니다.  
그리고 언제까지 이 게임을 지속적으로 붙잡고 관리해줄지에 대한 의지와 능력에도 의심이 갑니다. 내놓았더니 악평과 비난, 매출이 안나오는 게임들은 소리소문없이 패치나 개선을 끊어버리고 없는 자식 취급을 하는 것은 당연한 운명이기 때문입니다. 

차라리 빅토리아 3, 하츠 오브 아이언 4, 전작인 슈퍼파워 2 + 유저한글화 + 모드를 하세요. 지금 상태에서는 답이 없습니다.","This is written as of November 9, 2022. I'm starting to suspect this game was created with the intention of killing the Superpower franchise.
I even suspect it was released as a test to transform it into a multiplayer-focused online game, full of free-to-play and gacha mechanics.

They seem to be trying to resolve this issue with regular patches, but the lack of noticeable improvements is so frustrating.

The Korean translation is so poorly done that it would be better if users worked together to translate it. The translation is a mess, and some parts are rendered in English.

The UI, graphics, and everything else in this game are poorly optimized. Slowness and stuttering are commonplace, and it's incredibly resource-intensive. Unless a game like Superpower involves unimaginably high-powered nuclear weapons, it shouldn't be this demanding. Of course, it's possible to run the game on an outdated system with an Nvidia GTX 1070, 8GB of RAM, 16GB of DDR3 system memory, an AMD FX8300 quad-core, and two 256GB SSDs, but this isn't the case.

Furthermore, the convenient and detailed settings for combat, diplomacy, politics, trade, and weapon research are either regressed or virtually absent. The feature from the previous two games, which allowed players to choose whether to leave these settings to the AI ​​or to decide for themselves, is absent, making it cumbersome when annexing large territories or territories acquired through war.

Furthermore, I doubt the will and ability to continue to maintain and maintain this game. It's a natural fate for games that receive negative reviews, are criticized, and fail to generate sales to be quietly patched and improved, and treated as if they were nothing.

You'd be better off playing Victoria 3, Hearts of Iron 4, or the previous game, Superpower 2, with its localization and mods. As things stand now, there's no answer."

Let me just preface this review by saying I have only played the Superpower series from 2010 onward, specifically Superpower 2 between 2010-2013. I used to host a roleplay server that was usually called ""Will's RP Server"". I'll start out by recalling problems I had with Superpower 2, that game was an imperfect mess, it had a lot of bugs and I don't recall a single patch being released until it was brought to Steam in 2014 or whenever that was. However, a lot of those bugs had workarounds and there was a small modding community out there that fixed a lot of issues *cough* uberfox *cough* and Superpower 2 was unique in that the host could use a mod, but the players would not need to have that mod in order to play on the server (only certain mods). Bugs and other gameplay issues aside, the most fun I derived out of the multiplayer games was from social interaction and just genuinely great RP from the community/players, I think it was an entertaining experience for most players, especially with mods. I understand people enjoy Superpower in different ways, but I just wanted to give some background and my perspective before I give my thoughts on Superpower 3.

Starting out with graphics, obviously a decent jump in graphical quality, which pretty much should be a given in 2022 unless you're re-releasing Power and Revolution again. In saying that, it's not all improved. Visual clarity is lowered by the clouds and night time and if you disable them you have to look at a pretty lacklustre water texture - not good. Thematic maps and resource filters are just a pain to visually decipher sometimes, despite what they have changed with patches.

Like other reviewers have stated, Autarky is still a thing and the economic gameplay features and functions seem to have been reduced compared to Superpower 2. Economic statistics sometimes seem to be completely unrealistic and military placements and numbers wildly inaccurate. Military research for individual countries is wrong AND outdated for many countries, even for 2018. Not having airbases a la Power & Revolution and instead using airports is interesting but also just unrealistic. Only being able to build one military unit at a time is both unrealistic and a step backwards from the SP2 system. It seems they have made a lot of arbitrary choices about what to be realistic about and what not - probably for simplicity's sake.

There are many other problems and gameplay issues I have encountered over the 100 hours I have played so far (which has been mostly on multiplayer), but many other reviewers have already listed a lot of those in their own reviews. So I will just say that the 3 or 4 patches that Golemlabs have released so far have improved this game drastically since release and that from the perspective of an old SP2 player, at this point the game could probably be regarded as ""barely playable"". I wouldn't really expect GL to work too much more on this considering their track record (which is fine), but they will probably continue on with it for a while yet. Which is great for those who decided to stick it out or people considering playing again or even purchasing it, but my hope is that when modders start to create things and fix issues, this game could probably be near the level of SP2 fun, albeit with a few less innate features.

My recommendation is that if you're not a hardcore fan of the series you probably won't enjoy it in it's current state, but I would 100% recommend it on sale. If people buy it on sale, the player base might start to return and grow, sowing the seeds for a future community similar to Superpower 2.","[h1] [strike]Great[/strike] OK Sequel for an [strike]Great[/strike] OK Franchise [/h1]

Полностью убиты лучшие механики второй части. Вместо них теперь нечто, противоречащее здравому смыслу. Кажется, в нескольких местах просто перепутаны арифметические операторы. Например, если у вас иммиграция и эмиграция нулевые, а рождаемость превышает смертность, по здравой логике население должно расти. Но оно тут убывает! Как...? 
Попробовал играть за Андорру. Три сектора экономики - каждый примерно 1 ярду. Чему равен общий ВВП? 1+1+1=3? Не-а, по мнению разрабов 1+1+1=1.
Если потребление продукции отрасли у вас условно равно 10, а производство равно 12, будет ли бизнес импортировать эту продукцию? В реальности будет небольшой импорт для разнообразия ассортимента. Допустим на экспорт будет уходить 3 единицы, а импортироваться 1. Итого сальдо будет околонулевое. В игре же Производство может кратно превышать потребление, и при этом еще и будет идти импорт, также кратно превышающий потребление. Совершенно непонятная механика.
Ну, и так далее... Можно несколько страниц написать с перечислением тупостей игры.","Garbage! It feels like the developers got tired of making it and, at some random moment, decided to just roll it out as is. The best mechanics of the second game have been completely destroyed. In their place, there's something that defies common sense. It seems like the arithmetic operators are simply mixed up in several places. For example, if your immigration and emigration are zero, and the birth rate exceeds the death rate, by common sense, the population should be growing. But here it's declining! How...?

I tried playing as Andorra. Three economic sectors—each about 1 yard. What's the total GDP? 1 + 1 + 1 = 3? Nope, according to the developers, 1 + 1 + 1 = 1.
If consumption of a given industry's output is 10, and production is 12, will businesses import these products? In reality, there will be some imports to diversify the product range. Let's say 3 units are exported and 1 is imported. The net balance will be near zero. In the game, production can be many times greater than consumption, and at the same time, imports will also be many times greater than consumption. A completely incomprehensible mechanic.
And so on... Several pages could be written listing the game's stupidities."

2. Units that are split and sold become immobile; unit merging is ineffective.

4. Unit movement is mysteriously inconsistent. Unit icons disappear in various ways.

5. Industrial investments are sometimes effective, sometimes billions just sit there without taking effect.

6. The annexation system is confusing. It's unclear whether it requires active-duty personnel to land, tanks, or aircraft. Sometimes there's an annexation progress bar, but more often there isn't, making annexation impossible.

I clicked the recommendation button negatively because I can't get a refund after two hours, so I can only offer positive feedback. I hope the game can be like *No Man's Sky*, going from initial overwhelmingly negative reviews to continuous updates and player approval, gradually turning the tide.

Le trailer et les images donnaient envie, j'espérais une bonne mécanique et un gameplay plus intéressant pour un jeu de simulation géopolitique. Les possibilités pour gérer le pays et les relations internationales semblaient prometteuses mais malheureusement soient elles sont manquantes, soient bugués.

[h1] Les moins [/h1]
- Pas de tutoriel. Pourtant, pour un jeu complexe de géopolitique, un tutoriel serait le bienvenue.
- Le jeu propose des scénarios intéressants, mais en testant celui du conflit Ukraine-Russie, c'est devenu le bordel en 5 min avec des guerres déclarés de partout (sauf entre l'Ukraine et la Russie). 
- La gestion économique n'a pas l'air de fonctionner. En voulant développer des industries, rien ne se passe (même après 1 an), même augmenter les taxes d'un secteur ne semble pas impacter les rentrées d'argent. Par contre, taxer le peuple ironiquement ça fonctionne.
- Les relations internationales sont très limitées, elles peuvent basiquement se résumer à :
[olist]
    [*]Conclure deux traitées de bonnes ententes (culturel et développement humain) purement symboliques ou presque.
    [*]Mettre une ambassade, faire un embargo, ou obtenir un accès militaire à un pays.
    [*]Donne/Demander de l'argent ou des militaires (Sérieux..., l'Allemagne qui me demande 7 Milliards en début de partie comme ça, WTF !)
[/olist]
- Annexion ! Annexion ! Annexion ! Sérieusement, Poutine a participé au développement du jeu, le nombre d'annexions en une partie est ahurissant. Pourquoi les Etats-Unis annexent une région du Kazakhstan,... Et mon Dieu mais pourquoi l'Algérie d'un coup annexe une région de la Russie, puis attaque l'Italie sans prévenir, puis le Kosovo, puis la Hongrie. CE JEU N'A PAS DE SENS !!!

[h1] Les Plus [/h1]
- Il y a des rafales et le Charles-De-Gaulle dans le jeu.","It's already time for a review because this game is simply bad in its current state, and I can't continue playing it.
The trailer and screenshots were enticing; I was hoping for good mechanics and more interesting gameplay for a geopolitical simulation game. The possibilities for managing the country and international relations seemed promising, but unfortunately, they are either missing or buggy.

[h1]The Cons[/h1]

- No tutorial. Yet, for a complex geopolitical game, a tutorial would be welcome.

- The game offers interesting scenarios, but when testing the Ukraine-Russia conflict scenario, it became a mess within 5 minutes, with wars declared everywhere (except between Ukraine and Russia).

- The economic management doesn't seem to work. When trying to develop industries, nothing happens (even after a year), and even increasing taxes on a sector doesn't seem to impact revenue. On the other hand, ironically taxing the people works.

- International relations are very limited; they can basically be summarized as:

[olist]

[*]Conclude two purely symbolic or nearly symbolic treaties of good understanding (cultural and human development).

[*]Establish an embassy, ​​impose an embargo, or obtain military access to a country.

[*]Give/Request money or troops (Seriously... Germany asking me for 7 billion at the start of the game like that, WTF!)

[/olist]
- Annexation! Annexation! Annexation! Seriously, Putin participated in the development of the game; the number of annexations in a single game is staggering. Why does the United States annex a region of Kazakhstan...? And my God, why does Algeria suddenly annex a region of Russia, then attack Italy without warning, then Kosovo, then Hungary? THIS GAME MAKES NO SENSE!!!

[h1] The Plus Points [/h1]
- There are Rafale fighter jets and the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier in the game."

Aber was sie im dritten Teil abgeliefert haben ist sagenumwobend schlecht. Man kann das noch einmal als Spiel bezeichnen, eher nur ein Stromfresser mit ein paar Interaktionen.

Die paar Budgetregler, welche in Endeffekt das einzige sind, mit denen man sich im ""Spiel"" auseinandersetzen muss, sind ungenau und schwerfällig. Sobald man in den negativen wirtschafsbereichen investiert hat, muss man nur noch abwarten, bis ein Ergebnis gezeigt wird. Gleichzeitig wartet man auf die militärische Forschung, damit man nach ca 1-2 reallife Tage dann endlich mal Einheiten bauen kann um sein Territorium zu vergrößern.

Sogar bei jedem einfachen Handyspiel hat man mehr zu tun.

-> Superpower 3 ist ein Spiel was eigentlich kein Spiel ist und unmengen an Power braucht.","Until now, I was a fan of Superpower and was looking forward to a sequel. But what they delivered in the third installment is unbelievably bad. You can barely call it a game anymore; it's more like a power hog with a few interactions.

The few budget controls, which are essentially the only things you have to deal with in the ""game,"" are imprecise and cumbersome. Once you've invested in negative economic areas, you just have to wait for the results. At the same time, you're waiting for military research so that, after about one or two real-life days, you can finally build units to expand your territory.

Even a simple mobile game offers more to do.

L'éditeur de personnage.

D'une part, il fonctionne bien, mais il pose plus de question qu'il n'en résout. Le jeu insiste sur l'importance de la langue et de la religion de votre personnage, mais concrètement, cela n'a aucune utilité. Alors pourquoi le préciser ? A mon avis, des mécaniques de soulèvements ou de guerres civiles basées sur l'ethnie, la culture, la religion devaient être prévues, mais ont été abandonnées en chemin.  C'est dommage.

La localisation.

Mal faite, mal finie. Certaines infobulles ne sont pas traduites, et d'autres n'ont aucun sens. Ainsi, on lira ""si vous accumulez trop de dettes, votre pays deviendra insoluble"". Oui, c'est présent dans le jeu. Par ailleurs, plusieurs icônes sont manquantes.

Le tutoriel.

Il brille par son absence. On trouve cependant 3 ou 4 courtes vidéos, en anglais, et non sous-titrées. Ca rejoint la localisation indigente.

La population.

Plein de données, mais dont ignore l'utilité dans le jeu. Je suis tout à fait d'accord que l'on me parle de masculinité, d'individualisme  et de culture d'obéissance, mais j'aimerais quand même avoir une explication sur son rôle et sa finalité.

A contrario, au niveau de la politique intérieure, c'est le vide total. Aucun sondage sur l'opposition, ni sur son positionnement dans l'échiquier politique. Pas de campagne électorale du tout. C'est simple, un pop up m'a informé que j'avais été réélu. C'est une blague ?



L'économie: 

D'une part, elle n'est pas très personnalisée. Par exemple, que vous ayez des côtes ou pas, nulle trace d'industrie de la pêche .. Elle n'est pas davantage informative. Pour développer un secteur, vous devrez investir dedans, ce qui est logique, et vous aurez donc un impact environnemental (pollution, déforestation, ou occupation de terres arables). Alors, si vous avez les données avant d'investir, vous ignorez l'impact que vos futurs investissements pourraient avoir: c'est la surprise du chef !!

Le budget

le même amateurisme règne dans ce domaine. Les curseurs sont imprécis au possible, et en prime vous ne connaissez pas l'effet, là non plus, de vos décisions.
Je prendrai l'exemple de l'éducation : vous augmentez le budget, ce qui sur la papier est une bonne chose, puisque vous pourrez développer le recherche civile ou militaire, ou encore le secteur tertiaire. Sauf que vous ne savez pas d'où vous démarrez, ni où vous arriverez. Il n'y a tout simplement aucun graphique du taux d'éducation de votre population, que ce soit en fonction de l'âge ou autre. Il n'y a rien pour le primaire, secondaires, supérieur, universitaire. Vous allez complètement en aveugle. Vos investissez dans des secteurs sans même savoir si vous aurez assez de personnel qualifié pour le travail. Du grand n'importe quoi !
Même chose pour les infrastructures, c'est la grande inconnue.

La dette, également. Si vous avez des fonds propres, vous pourriez être tenté de faire des remboursement anticipés. dans le cas de l'amérique du sud, c'est crucial tant le remboursement annuel pèse sur le budget. Eh bien non, c'est impossible. Vous continuez à rembourser pendant 20 ans, parce qu'il n'y a pas non plus d'étalement. Et quant au taux d'intérêt, je n'en ai pas vu mention, je me dis donc qu'il doit être fixe, que vous soyez vertueux ou pas .



Politique:

Quelques mots pour une grande absente. Vous ne connaissez pas votre place sur l'échiquier politique, ni celle de vos adversaires, d'ailleurs. Il n' y a du reste pas de représentation du spectre politique où que ce soit. Ce ne serait pourtant ni du luxe, ni bien difficile.

Du coup, pas de politique sociale du tout, et quant à la politique éco, je vous en ai parlé plus haut. Dans les faits, il est impossible d'opérer la moindre dépense sociale.  Ce qui mène à un autre énorme problème: le chômage. C'est simple, j'ai pu maintenir une croissance à près de 3%, et le chômage n'a jamais cessé de monter. Ce qui assez logiquement à fait baisser mes revenus de façon drastique. Du grand n'importe quoi. 




La diplomatie.

Simpliste et peu ergonomique.
Pour ma part, je n'ai pas pu remarquer si mes traités avec un pays donné pouvaient influencer mes relations avec un autre pays. Une alliance avec l' Iran pourraient-elles me valoir une mise au ban avec les USA ? Mystère.
Quant à l'ergonomie, justement : si vous voulez faire un traité rapidement, vous avez un menu de sélection rapide pour les pays alliés ou en guerre. Pour les autres, vous devrez fermer les menus, chercher le pays sur la mappemonde, le sélectionner et ouvrir à nouveau le menu diplomatique.
Préhistorique.

A ce stade, j'ai jeté l'éponge sans même me lancer dans une guerre. Pour une guerre, il faut des alliés, une armée, des ressources, une industrie correcte, un ennemi qui ne vous tienne pas par les cou....es. Franchement, vu les problèmes en amont, ça ne m'a même pas donné envie de m'y mettre. Le menu militaire est crade, en plus d'être illogique. Vos chars du XXI eme siècle ont pour icônes des chars de la 2nde GM. Stupéfiant, mais rigoureusement exact.


En conclusion, Superpower 3 est un jeu particulièrement raté auquel je cherche vainement la moindre qualité, réalisme, ou encore aspect pédagogique voire sociologique. Il y a probablement de bonnes idées, mais aucune n'est implémentée comme il se doit, et l'ensemble n'a aucun sens. En, l'état, y jouer relève du supplice. Les raccourcis clavier sont rares et insuffisants, il n'y a qu'une vitesse de jeu, etc ...

A ce stade, le mieux est encore que l'éditeur le retire et rembourse tout le monde. Ensuite, à lui de le reprendre de fond en comble et de le sortir à nouveau dans un délai de 6 à 18 mois. S'il espère résoudre les failles et remonter la pente avec quelques patches, il se berce d'illusions. On ne revient pas de 8% d'opinions positives par un coup de baguette magique.

[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/39131147-Jeux-joue/] Pour suivre mon groupe de curation[/url]","Let's be frank, I only bought this game to write this review, having spent 8 hours playing it at someone else's house. I was therefore able to test several matches with France, Brazil, New Zealand, and finally Brunei.

As far as I'm concerned, Superpower 3 is a flop like few others, not even managing to equal SP2, which is from 2004. That's quite an achievement.

The graphics.

From the title screen, you realize the limitations of the game: you choose between fullscreen and windowed mode. If you choose the latter, part of the menu disappears as soon as you want to play in 2K or higher. From then on, you're forced to play in 1024. In 2022, that's simply unacceptable.

The character editor.

On the one hand, it works well, but it raises more questions than it answers. The game emphasizes the importance of your character's language and religion, but in practice, this serves no purpose. So why even mention it? In my opinion, mechanics for uprisings or civil wars based on ethnicity, culture, and religion should have been included, but were abandoned along the way. It's a shame.

The localization.

Poorly executed, poorly finished. Some tooltips aren't translated, and others are completely nonsensical. For example, you'll read, ""If you accumulate too much debt, your country will become untenable."" Yes, that's in the game. Furthermore, several icons are missing.

The tutorial.

It's conspicuously absent. There are, however, three or four short videos, in English, without subtitles. This reinforces the poor localization.

The population.

Plenty of data, but its usefulness in the game is unclear. I'm perfectly fine with the talk about masculinity, individualism, and a culture of obedience, but I'd still like an explanation of its role and purpose.

Conversely, the domestic political aspect is a complete void. No polls on the opposition, nor on its position on the political spectrum. No election campaign at all. Simply put, a pop-up informed me that I'd been re-elected. Is this a joke?

The economy:

Firstly, it's not very personalized. For example, whether you have coastlines or not, there's no mention of a fishing industry. It's also not very informative. To develop a sector, you'll have to invest in it, which makes sense, and this will have an environmental impact (pollution, deforestation, or the use of arable land). So, if you have the data before investing, you're unaware of the impact your future investments might have: it's a complete surprise!

The Budget

The same amateurish approach prevails in this area. The indicators are incredibly imprecise, and on top of that, you don't know the effect of your decisions either.

Take education, for example: you increase the budget, which on paper is a good thing, since you can develop civilian or military research, or even the service sector. Except that you don't know where you're starting from, or where you'll end up. There's simply no graph of your population's education level, whether by age or otherwise. There's nothing for primary, secondary, higher, or university education. You're going in completely blind. You're investing in sectors without even knowing if you'll have enough qualified staff for the jobs. Utter nonsense!

The same goes for infrastructure; it's a complete unknown.

Debt, too. If you have equity, you might be tempted to make early repayments. In the case of South America, this is crucial, given how much the annual repayments weigh on the budget. Well, no, it's impossible. You continue to repay for 20 years, because there's no option to spread the payments out. And as for the interest rate, I haven't seen any mention of it, so I assume it must be fixed, whether you're being fiscally responsible or not.

Politics:

A few words about a major omission. You don't know your place on the political spectrum, nor that of your opponents, for that matter. Furthermore, there's no representation of the political spectrum anywhere. Yet, it wouldn't be a luxury, nor particularly difficult.

Consequently, there's no social policy at all, and as for economic policy, I mentioned it earlier. In reality, it's impossible to make any social expenditures whatsoever. Which leads to another huge problem: unemployment. Simply put, I managed to maintain growth at nearly 3%, yet unemployment never stopped rising. This, quite logically, caused my income to plummet. Utter nonsense.

Diplomacy.

Simplistic and clunky.

Personally, I couldn't determine whether my treaties with a given country could influence my relations with another. Could an alliance with Iran lead to me being blacklisted by the US? A mystery.

As for the user interface: if you want to quickly create a treaty, there's a quick selection menu for allied or warring countries. For others, you have to close the menus, find the country on the world map, select it, and then reopen the diplomatic menu. Prehistoric.

At this point, I threw in the towel without even starting a war. For a war, you need allies, an army, resources, a decent industry, and an enemy that doesn't have you by the throat. Frankly, given the problems from the start, it didn't even make me want to play it. The military menu is a mess, not to mention illogical. Your 21st-century tanks have WWII tank icons. Astounding, but absolutely true.

In conclusion, Superpower 3 is a particularly bad game in which I search in vain for any quality, realism, or even educational or sociological aspects. There are probably some good ideas, but none are implemented properly, and the whole thing makes no sense. As it stands, playing it is torture. Keyboard shortcuts are few and far between, there's only one game speed, etc.

At this point, the best thing would be for the publisher to withdraw it and refund everyone. Then, it's up to him to completely rebuild it and relaunch it within 6 to 18 months. If he hopes to fix the flaws and turn things around with a few patches, he's deluding himself. You can't magically reverse an 8% positive rating.

まあ、他にも色々言いたいけど、総評としては、地球と宇宙って綺麗だなーって感想以外ないです。わざわざ作りかけの初期のスマホゲー以下のゴミを買わせてくれてありがとうございます。申し訳ないけどお返しします。ゲームが良くなったまた買うかもしれません。","I couldn't wait until Victoria III was released, so I bought it as a stopgap, but you're kidding me lol (seriously)... Are you serious? There's not even a tutorial? Even Paradox has one. They're not even interested in adding new players, so they're not very motivated... There are a lot of bugs, you can't create a beautiful character, and you can't speed up the time, which is frustrating. It's a shame, considering there are various scenarios like restoring the Ottoman Empire or the Soviet Union.
Well, there's a lot more I want to say, but overall, I can't help but think that the Earth and space are beautiful. Thank you for making me buy this garbage, which is worse than the early smartphone games you were working on. I'm sorry, but I'll give it back. If the game gets better, I might buy it again."

Even if the combat square did not glitch out units and become stuck for the rest of the game the combat square would still be a downgrade from the superpower II's dust ball since it can entrap more than just the region the battle is centered on but the battle plays out too fast to make any interactions or decisions meaningful. There are no consequences at the moment for almost any decision despite there not even being a choice of government type(update.1-you can now choose your government type) and every nation will accept a proposed war declaration on any other nation(update.2-Nations now won't accept wars but still accept all other forms of diplomacy if relations are equal to North Korea with Italy).

No map layers for any country but your own, dead AI, deathball only functional wartime strategy, zero army differentiation across nations, I think there are more avatar facial feature options than there are base military unit designs across the entire world. Overall there is very little to even get excited about at the moment since added statistics that should be showing how decisions and choices pan out over your nation's timeline either do not work or are broken. While they reduced political choices with limited consequences they increased economic decisions across economic sectors but these gains are overridden by a dysfunctional trade system that is rooted in unique superpower III economic principles and not basic accounting or finance concepts. I could go on about how many downgrades and poor design choices they made, and I am trying not to complain too much about the ""glitches"" that can be hotfixed, but I will end here.

123701227,russian,2022.09.12 03:25,❌,❌,0.6467624903,17,"К сожалению, я поиграл в эту игру более 12 часов и не смогу получить возврат средств. 

Игра мне полностью не понравилась. Советую не приобретать в этом году эту игрушку.

Из минусов:
• Баги и жесткие фризы, лаги на мощных компьютерах. Вы не сможете поиграть спокойно в эту игру, потому что с момента загрузки встречаются уже подвисания и различные глюки. 
• Много вырезали контента. Это Вам теперь не прежний Super Power 2, с доработками и улучшениями в новой третьей франшизе. Здесь, к сожалению, ситуация очень плачевно. Нельзя поменять правящую партию, нельзя менять форму правления, нельзя исключать/выходить/входить/добавлять в общий союз страны. Нельзя войти в другие договора, заключенными между с собой другими странами. Система очень странно проработана в SP3. Ну и ещё, список договоров очень мало.
• Неудобный геймплей с различными кучей багов. Когда ты с кем то воюешь - невозможно спокойно играть. На поле битвы с врагами у тебя подчеркивается это всё каким-то непонятным красным квадратом, где войска твоей страны и страны ИИ просто тупят, глючат и фризять. Например, твою миллионную армию могут победить 1000 пехотинцев… Проблема так же с передвижениями войск, они иногда просто не передвигаются, поскольку иногда просто не возможно поставить для войск метку, чтобы те направились в то указанное место, она багается.
• Ужасный огромной интерфейс, который занимает весь экран. Моё предположение, что разрабы пытались что-то взаимствовать из Симулятора Геополитики, но у разрабов SP3 это очень криво-косо получилось. Менюшки все, интерфейсы тоже лагают. Невозможно нажать на кнопки, даже кнопку выхода из игры невозможно порой с первого раза нажать, нужно тыкать миллиард раз, только тогда…
• Ограниченный выбор создания персонажа. Хотя, безусловно, что разрабы внедрили вообще сам факт того, что можно своего перса создать - это уже круто. Но тоже мне не очень понравились предложенные варианты для создания персонажа. Правитель мужчина - всегда мускулистый, старый, с большим носом «картошкой». Женщина правительница - молодая женщина, с телом как у колокола... Короче, полный треш-контент… И ужасная прорисовка самих персонажей. Мыло-мыльное.
• Реальная графика игры сильно отличается от того, что показывали в трейлере. На ультра-настройках графика полный отстой. Графика немного рябит, при приближении прорисовываются детали, которые на земле с очень долгими и жуткими фризами и лагами, опять же. Тематические карты сделаны непонятно. 

Это ещё далеко не все последние минусы, чтобы описать весь накопившийся пипец, связанный с СП3.
Советую сейчас не брать эту игру до фиксов багов разрабами.
Проскочил слушок, что изначальных разрабов после выхода игры - уволили. Поэтому, я так думаю, процесс «обновления» игры будет очень долгим. Может год, может два, на скорое обновление не надейтесь. Дружно возращаемся во вторую часть франщизы и ностальгируем, наслаждаемся! А эта часть пока что сырая. 
","Unfortunately, I played this game for over 12 hours and won't be able to get a refund.

I thoroughly disliked the game. I advise against purchasing it this year.

Cons:
• Bugs and severe freezes, lags on high-end computers. You won't be able to play this game smoothly, as you'll encounter freezes and various glitches from the moment you load.

• A lot of content has been cut. This isn't the same Super Power 2 as before, with the refinements and improvements of the new third installment. Unfortunately, the situation here is dire. You can't change the ruling party, you can't change the form of government, you can't exclude/leave/join/add countries to the alliance. You can't enter into other treaties between other countries. The system is very strangely designed in SP3. Also, the list of treaties is very limited.
• Uneasy gameplay with a ton of bugs. When you're at war with someone, it's impossible to play smoothly. On the battlefield, you see all this highlighted by some strange red square, where your country's troops and the AI's are simply slow, glitching, and freezing. For example, your million-strong army can be defeated by 1,000 infantry... Troop movement is also a problem; sometimes they simply don't move, because sometimes it's simply impossible to mark troops to direct them to a specific location; it's glitchy.
• A terribly huge interface that takes up the entire screen. My guess is that the developers were trying to borrow something from Geopolitical Simulator, but the SP3 developers did a very poor job of it. All the menus and interfaces are also laggy. It's impossible to press buttons, even the exit button sometimes fails to click the first time; you have to click a billion times before it works...
• Limited character creation options. Although, of course, the fact that the developers even implemented the ability to create your own character is already pretty cool. But I also didn't really like the proposed character creation options. The male ruler is always muscular, old, with a big, bulbous nose. The female ruler is a young woman with a bell-shaped body... In short, it's complete trash... And the character designs themselves are terrible. Totally dull.
• The actual game graphics are very different from what was shown in the trailer. On ultra settings, the graphics are complete crap. The graphics are a bit choppy, and when zooming in, details are rendered that are on the ground with very long and terrifying freezes and lags, again. Thematic maps are poorly designed.

These are far from the last few downsides to describe the accumulated mess associated with SP3.
I advise against playing this game right now until the developers fix the bugs.
I heard a rumor that the original developers were fired after the game's release. Therefore, I think the process of ""updating"" the game will be very long. Maybe a year, maybe two; don't expect an update anytime soon. Let's all return to the second part of the franchise and revel in the nostalgia and enjoy! This part is still in its infancy.

Są one jednak tak widoczne na pierwszy rzut oka że nie wiem jakim cudem wypuszczono grę bez poprawy tych błędów skoro są tak oczo**bne. Do tego smaczek czyli gdy wrzucimy do produkcji np czołgi, zamkniemy (nie zminimalizujemy tylko zamkniemy) okno produkcji i produkcja się skończy to jak wejdziemy spowrotem to produkowana armia zniknie zamiast pojawić się w zakładce rozstawienia armii.
2. Brak samouczka - to to już jest kpina na potęgę, co prawda poogarniałem większość rzeczy, ale jak można wypuścić grę grand strategy i nie dać do niej samouczka?
3. Grafika - Raz że graficzne glitche (nie wiem czy pijany to robił czy o co chodzi), dwa że sama jakość grafiki okien, interfejsu to jest jakaś tania kpina.

Po tak tragicznym starcie, już na drugi dzień powinien być patch który łata chociaż te podstawowe błędy, bo THQ strzela sobie w stopę tą premierą...

Kilka godzin budowania gospodarki, po to by szybko rozwinąć wojsko i w momencie rozpoczęcia ekspansji nie da się grać.

However, they're so obvious at first glance that I don't know how the game was released without fixing these bugs, since they're so glaring. Plus, if you add tanks to a production run, close (not minimize, just close) the production window, and the production ends, when you go back in, the army being produced disappears instead of appearing in the army deployment tab.
2. No tutorial - that's a complete joke. Admittedly, I've figured out most of the details, but how can you release a grand strategy game and not include a tutorial?
3. Graphics - Firstly, there are graphical glitches (I don't know if he was drunk or what's going on), and secondly, the quality of the windows and interface graphics is a cheap joke.

After such a disastrous start, there should have been a patch the very next day that would at least fix these basic bugs, because THQ is shooting themselves in the foot with this release...

After almost six hours of gameplay, I'm even more frustrated.

Several hours of building an economy to quickly expand my army, and the moment I start expanding, I'm unplayable. Units don't react, or they react randomly, half the units die, and the army statistics don't add up. It's a disaster. A massive patch is needed here, quickly, because what Cyberpunk 2077 had at launch on PlayStation is nothing compared to what THQ Nordic did on PC with this game.

This makes the game stressful and frustrating....and the more time passes in the game, the worse it gets... the diplomacy is extremely shallow, the economic part isn't much better, it doesn't surprise me that there wasn't a gameplay preview before...otherwise this game would be slaughtered by the community that expects a sequel worthy of SP2..
I believe that if you are in doubt about buying it, Dio, in all words: definitely................................NOT WORTH IT!!!!
Save your precious money for something that actually works and that entertains you....without further ado, there's only something left to do if there's an update that saves this game from itself."

It's far inferior to the second game. The military command and occupation systems are a mess. At least add a one-click occupation function. The economic and political systems are chaotic and unscientific. Some translations are also problematic. Don't disappoint consumers for nothing. After all, everyone has been waiting for so long for the third installment. I hope the developers can improve it and avoid a bad ending. I look forward to your quick updates and improvements.

I was given this game for free. The retail price as Im writing this review is about 30€ with a 10% sale making it about 27€. 

Before anything else I want to point out that this game only has 1 (fairly slow) speed setting. Meaning this turns out to be a fairly slow game to play. 

I want to start with the things I really liked about this game. Sadly there is not too much to like. Its a very flavourless game, with fairly little content and a fair few bugs and other issues which deduct from the fun I could have had. 

Alot of people dislike comparing it to SP2. However that was a 18 year old game which feels like it had roughly the same amount of content which this game does. Now SP2 was not a very deep game. However it had alot of flavour and it allowed you to have fun with that flavour.

 The roleplay servers of old on SP2 were so great because of the freedom you had withinn SP2. You wanted to play a theocratic communist UK which discriminates against English people ? Go right ahead there are ways to do that.  As of today playing a country i can choose between allowing elections and not allowing elections. And a very binary choice of Dictatorship or Democracy. Making a communist country and a theocracy more or less the same. 

SP 2 allowed you to discriminate/favour based on religion/ language.  SP3 downgrades that system. And meshes culture, religion and language all in one bloc. For example  you have Black/White South African. Demarking social group on racial grounds, while other places its Christian vs Muslim Tongoleese demarking social group on language grounds. In Serbia you have Serbs and Hungarian serbs... Well what seperates a Hungarian and a Hungarian serb if they live in the same country? This also removes flavour. 

SP2 had what felt like 200 diffrent economic sectors. Here we have maybe 16? Autarky still appears to be the way to go. They try to limit this with limiting the amount of farmland your country can have. Which does not really make the situation any better. It just means you have to invade other countires in a long game. 

Im still trying to figure out how to use the unit designer and how to purchase more army units. But this is probably because Im retarded. I dont think the UI is all that great. You can have bad UI which is functional. This appears just to be bad. 

War has had a rewamp which is... Not horrible but far from great. You now have to continiously occupy the provinces which you want to take over. Thats cool. Had it not been for the fact that some countires which are the size of a stamp have 1000 provinces and the USA has 50. There is no ""occupy button"" which there was in SP2. A feature I miss when we have to deal with continious occupation. 

All in all. Its just disapointing. It lacks a ton of features. It has no flavour to speak off. The servers were beyond fucked on release. All in all Im just disapointed. I dont know if its because the devs were rushed, or because the devs were lazy, If you can get it on a super sale. Sure go for it. If not stay clear.","This review was written 09.10.22

Pas de ville sur la carte c'est super abstrait... On peux augmenté les investissements dans des domaines mai pas les diminué 
Un peux plus d'options économique et autre serait pas de refus 

Les point positifs:la carte est belle mai manque de détails ( villes qui manque ect) ça apporterait plus de profondeur de jeux
Le multi joueur (pas testé) si il marche bien au top
Interface claire et visuellement agréable
Côté militaire à l'air sympa mai bridé par le Zoom qui rend les guerres impossible à géré 

En résumé:
-Interface claire gros points fort à mon avis
-Manque d'options de gestions,économique, politique
-Manque Grafique évolutif pour suivre l'évolution de ça politique.
Pour plus de profondeur de jeux
-Manque D'information sur la carte (ville route) 
-Zoom carte catastrophique à mon goûts qui rent le jeux difficilement jouable 

Je recommande pas ce jeux en l'état mai j'espère les futures jours corrigerons les défauts de ce jeux qui pour moi a du potentiel","No crashes for me, but a few issues. First, the zoom is useless; you can't see anything on the map. Units move, but there's no way to see close-up combat, which is really not great. There are no cities on the map; it's very abstract. You can increase investments in certain areas, but not decrease them. A few more economic and other options would be welcome.

The positives: The map is beautiful but lacks detail (missing cities, etc.). This would add more depth to the game. The multiplayer (not tested) is great if it works well. The interface is clear and visually appealing. The military aspect seems interesting but is hampered by the zoom, making wars impossible to manage.

In summary:
- Clear interface: a major strength in my opinion.
- Lack of management, economic, and political options.
- Lack of dynamic graphics to track political developments. For more gameplay depth:
-Lack of information on the map (city, roads)
-The map zoom is disastrous in my opinion, making the game difficult to play

I don't recommend this game in its current state, but I hope future updates will correct the flaws of this game, which I believe has potential."

#Currently Confirmed Patch Count: 8 (23-01-16)

[b][Politics][/b]
01. Fewer treaty items than in SP2.
02. Political systems cannot be changed at will. (Ex. Military dictatorship, democracy, communism, monarchy, etc.)
03. The inconvenience of having to sign treaties with each country at a time. (In SP2, it was possible to sign treaties with multiple countries.)
04. AI from other countries suddenly demands money for no reason.
05. Friendship with all countries is low. Reason unknown. (Although treaties with the maximum foreign aid budget, embassies, human development, and cultural exchanges have been signed, relations have deteriorated over time.)
06. Politics - Information about the next election is not displayed properly in the domestic tab. (Ex. The current date is January 28, but the next election is displayed as March 22.)

[b][Military][/b]
01. Frame drops during combat.
[strike]02. I don't know how to develop nuclear weapons.[/strike]
ㄴ※ If you max out the nuclear research budget and wait, you can see that nuclear research is in progress. (Damage, range, area, accuracy)
03. You have to press the M key to move troops.
04. I don't know how to use the Air Force.
05. I can't design weapons to my liking. (The design changes depending on the weapon's performance.)
[strike]06. I don't know how to merge troops. (The splitting works fine, but the merge button doesn't activate.)[/strike]
ㄴ※ Now, only units with the same name can be merged. (Patch)
07. Military tab - Bug in the market section of troops (presumably).
ㄴ07-1. The market number is increasing, but there are no purchasable items (items displayed). {A bug occurs in the later stages (after a certain amount of time has passed)}
[strike]ㄴ07-2. The items I've listed are displayed, but the market number doesn't increase.[/strike]
[strike]08. Troop movement is not possible.[/strike]
ㄴ08-1. Purchased units cannot move after arriving in the capital.
ㄴ08-2. Troop movement is not possible.
09. Troops are not attacking. (Ex. Friendly and enemy tanks in the combat zone do not attack each other despite being within striking distance. Reason unknown. Possibly a bug.)
10. Troops still have a (green) afterimage after passing the intended route.

[b][Economy][/b]
01. Unable to recover investment in resource production.
02. Decreased resource production. (Unable to confirm whether this is a bug or functionally normal.)
03. The budget bar responds slowly when dragging within the budget section.
04. After selecting Economy-Sector-Resources and nationalizing, the list of countries involved in imports and exports (trade) is displayed in a page format, causing inconvenience. (A convenience patch is needed to automatically flip through the pages when the mouse cursor is moved.)
04-1. Deleting a country involved in imports and exports (trade) causes lag.
05. When privatizing resources, exports and imports do not function properly, resulting in inventory remaining.
06. The national treasury (funds) does not display a negative value (it does not go below 0).
07. The revenue from tariffs (taxes) and exports is not provided in detail.
08. During trade investment through nationalization, the other country may accept the request but not be added to the list. The export and import figures are still reflected.

※ In this case, the app will likely crash after a short while, stating that the connection to the server has been lost. (Crashes 1 out of 3 times.)
ㄴ※ In this case, inventory and import/export figures for the other country are likely not reflected.
09. After selecting Economy-Sector-Resources, the Nationalized Status and the Countries with Import/Export (Trade) status are not displayed properly.
ㄴ09-1. When adding or deleting countries for import/export, the entire list of countries disappears. (Going to Overview and then returning to the relevant resource item will restore the list.)
ㄴ09-2. The countries for import/export of a given resource are not displayed properly. (Example: The ""Meat"" item is displayed mixed with the countries for import/export of the ""Education"" item.)
ㄴ09-3. Even after the country for import/export of a given resource is destroyed, the country remains in the trade list. (Example: North Korea collapsed, but the export/import records were not deleted and trade continued.)
ㄴ09-4. Even if the country for import/export of a given resource is insufficient, the country for import/export of the resource remains in the trade list. (Ex. Even if the inventory becomes negative after selling 10 units of gas, the transaction continues.)
In cases 09-3 and 09-4, trade revenue is reflected in the Economy-Budget. (Ex. Even if the exporting or importing country goes bankrupt or the corresponding resource becomes scarce, the transaction is considered ongoing and reflected in the revenue calculation.)
10. The government budget in the Economy-Budget is displayed as $0. (It remains $0 whether the budget is raised or lowered. However, there is an effect. If the budget is raised, corruption decreases, and if it is lowered, corruption increases.)
11. A bug that causes the GDP to become 0. (This bug occurred in 1942 in Angola. Presumed to be a bug.)
12. During automatic resource trading in the Economy-Privatization, if multiple exports or imports are made to the same country, the list of countries being traded is displayed abnormally. (Example: If you execute three (privatization auto) export transactions with the US, the US will appear in the list of trading countries three times. There should only be one, and it should be added to the existing transaction.)
13. In the Economy-Budget section, the private research results are displayed as ""World Average Productivity -nan(ind) T."" (version 1.0.6)
14. In the Economy-Budget section, the ""Environmental Revenue Sources"" section is displayed as ""Agricultural Land -nan."" (version 1.0.6)

[b][Other][/b]
[strike]01. Images that were previously displayed correctly are now broken. [/strike]
ㄴ01-1. Images in the Military - Military tab are sometimes broken.
ㄴ01-2. Leader faces are broken when loading.
02. Incorrect translation (e.g., ""Net Income (eul)"" is translated as ""Balance (eul)"").
[strike]03. Some untranslated information.[/strike]
ㄴ03-1. Untranslated items were added due to ongoing patches. Therefore, the phrase ""slightly"" has been corrected to ""untranslated.""

04. An AI that doesn't fire a single nuclear weapon while North Korea's Kim Jong-un is falling apart.

05. A challenge that's hard to understand how to clear.

06. A user interface that doesn't understand why the demographics section includes network, budget, and policy decisions.
[strike]07. The mouse button occasionally doesn't work on the map.[/strike] ※ Patch
[strike]ㄴ07-1. The right mouse button is blocked in the sea.[/strike] ※ Patch
[strike]ㄴ07-2. The mouse button is blocked when hovering the mouse cursor on land. (It's assumed the mouse button is blocked by the UI of the country holding the territory, preventing clicks.)[/strike] ※ Patch
08. The people (AI) still love me even with 100% personal income tax.
[strike]09. No speed higher than 2x.[/strike]
ㄴ※ 3x speed added with patch.
[strike]10. Unfamiliar numbers. (Ex. 1T, 4.2M, 24B, etc.), (Note: 1B = 1,000,000,000) [/strike]
ㄴ※ Hovering the mouse cursor over the number reveals detailed information. (Patch)
11. Friendly nations are displayed in orange during diplomatic relations. (In SP2, high friendly nations are displayed in green during diplomatic relations.)
12. Unknown leader customization.
[strike][b][u]13. No auto-save function. [/u][/b][/strike]
ㄴ13-1. Cannot set the auto-save point. (e.g., every few minutes)
14. Real-time timer malfunction (= severe lag) (e.g., instead of passing time sequentially from January 1, 2022, to January 13, 2022, it shifts slightly to January 13, 2022).
ㄴ※ Slow response times when pause/restarting due to this issue.
15. When loading, graphs do not display records from previous years. (e.g., when saving in 2020 and loading, records from before 2020 are not displayed.)
16. Population-related graphs in the population statistics are inaccurate. (e.g., the selected item is Korean, but the output shows North Korean.)
17. When clicking on a country in the Main Menu - Single Player - New Game, the profile does not display. (Demographics, Politics, Economy, Military)
18. In the Population Statistics - Support tab, crop saturation is displayed as -na%. (version 1.0.6)"

Да это мемная игра. Да, это не то чего все ждали. Но пока лично меня эта игра веселит, положительный отзыв останется. Есть зачатки некоторых хороших вещей. Учитывая что все современные игры это сплошной ранний доступ, то старт нормальный. Да игра не работает как должна, ползунки сломаны, непонятно решительно всё, куда тыкать и что делать тоже. Как например сделать ядерный удар по Израилю играя за Палестину? Реактор есть! Деньги вроде тоже. Как построить ракету и жахнуть? Но ребят, Супер Повар это же мем в принципе. Вспомните вторую часть! Какой был конструктор юнитов! ММмм. Абрамс на шасси ЛТ из танков онлайн. Это тоже мем, за 899 рублей, но мем! Давайте разрабы, деньги на разработку получили? Пора разрабатывать игру!

Yes, this is a meme-worthy game. Yes, it's not what everyone was expecting. But as long as I personally enjoy this game, my positive feedback will remain. There are some rudimentary good features. Considering that all modern games are pure early access, the start is okay. Yes, the game doesn't work as it should; the sliders are broken, absolutely everything is unclear, including where to click and what to do. For example, how do you nuke Israel as Palestine? I have a reactor! I think I have money too. How do you build a missile and launch it? But guys, Super Chef is basically a meme. Remember the second game! What a Unit Designer it was! Mmmm. Abrams on a LT chassis from Tanks Online. It's also a meme, for 899 rubles, but it's a meme! Come on, developers, did you get the development money? It's time to develop the game!

- On ne peut pas accélérer le temps donc le jeu est vite ennuyeux, j'ai eu le temps de manger j'ai laissé le jeu tourner il ne s'était rien passé d'incroyable...
- Les données ne me semblent pas cohérentes, au début d'une partie avec l'Australie je peux mettre quasiment tous les budgets à fond en étant toujours en excédent
- Pareil pour les productions du pays, au début de partie l'Australie est quasiment indépendante on importe rien la balance commerciale est à plusieurs centaines de milliards de dollars d'excédent (alors que l'Australie en 2018 la même année que le début de la partie avait une balance commerciale de 18 milliards)
- L'IA ne sert à rien je suis allé jusqu'en 2026 il n'y a rien eu de spécial juste quelques pays qui ont développé une arme nucléaire mais pour ne rien en faire
- Pas de sauvegarde automatique
- Il manque des files pour la production d'unités ou encore la recherche
- J'ai l'impression que le jeu consomme énormément de ressources pour un résultat franchement bof.

La liste n'est pas exhaustive mais je ne recommanderai ce jeu à personne il n'est même pas terminé, j'ai trouvé, en cherchant dans les fichiers du jeu des commentaires des développeurs :
""todo JR - doit être fait au niveau de la SRegion, pas du SCountry""
""ATTENDRE LE BUILD POUR TESTER""
Évidemment il y'a plein d'autres commentaires mais ce ne sont que des exemples.
J'ai trouvé une ligne dans le fichier SuperPower3\Data\SP3.ini qui parle de la vitesse du jeu, j'ai donc essayé de la modifier pour l'accélérer mais ça n'a rien fait du tout...

Ne l'achetez pas, ou en tout cas tant qu'il ne sera pas terminé. A ce stade, ce jeu n'est pas jouable.
A titre de comparaison Power & Revolution est parfaitement optimisé comparé à SuperPower 3.","This is the only review I've posted.

The concept is incredible, but unfortunately, that's the only incredible thing about it, along with the sheer number of bugs.

I'm extremely disappointed. I was going to play this game with friends, like I did with SuperPower 2, but I told them not to buy it. I don't know if updates will be enough, but I hope so.

A small selection of all the problems encountered in less than 5 hours of gameplay:

- The pause button doesn't work properly.
- The ""merge"" button (to gather troops) only works half the time and with a huge delay.
- You can't speed up time, so the game quickly becomes boring. I had time to eat, I left the game running, and nothing amazing happened...
- The data doesn't seem consistent. At the start of a game with Australia, I can max out almost all budgets and still have a surplus.
- The same goes for the country's production. At the start of the game, Australia is practically self-sufficient; we import nothing, and the trade balance is several hundred billion dollars in surplus (whereas in 2018, the same year the game started, Australia had a trade balance of 18 billion).
- The AI ​​is useless. I played until 2026, and nothing special happened, just a few countries that developed nuclear weapons, but to no avail. To do this:
- No autosave
- There are missing queues for unit production and research
- I feel like the game consumes a huge amount of resources for a frankly mediocre result.

This list isn't exhaustive, but I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. It's not even finished. I found comments from the developers while searching through the game files:

""todo JR - must be done at the SRegion level, not the SCountry level""
""WAIT FOR THE BUILD TO TEST""
Obviously, there are many other comments, but these are just examples.

I found a line in the SuperPower3\Data\SP3.ini file that talks about the game speed, so I tried modifying it to speed it up, but it didn't do anything at all...

Don't buy it, or at least not until it's finished. At this stage, this game is unplayable.

For comparison, Power & Revolution is perfectly optimized compared to SuperPower 3."

Ich dachte mir naja, sogar wenn es nicht das tollste Spiel des Jahres ist, kann es bestimmt nicht sooo schlecht sein, oder? Dieses Genre ist etwas schwierig, doll zu verkacken! Aber doch. So kritisch kann es doch sein. Die Benutzerschnittstelle ist viel zu groß, als ob sie eher für Mobilspiele gemacht wäre. Mit der Karte zu interagieren fällt mir sehr schwierig, als ob meine Mausklicks nur ab und zu registriert werden. Das Spiel ist auch nicht besonders gut optimiert, und läuft nicht so schnell, wie es auf meinem Rechner eigentlich sollte. Ich könnte es nur schaffen, so 10 Minuten zu spielen, bevor ich dieses Spiel einfach nicht mehr tolerieren konnte. Leider kann ich nichts über die tieferen Aspekte des Spiels sagen, da ich es wie gesagt einfach nicht spielen will. Trotzdem sieht es im großen und ganzem so aus, als ob der Vorgänger das bessere Spiel ist. Vieles von dem, was ich mir wünschte, fehlt diesem Spiel, und sogar alte Features sind auch nicht ganz da - ich meine, man kann nicht einmal die Geschwindigkeit ändern! Wirklich! Du kannst entweder pausieren oder laufen lassen, aber schneller/langsamer geht irgendwie nicht.

Hoffentlich wird das Spiel mit der Zeit besser werden, aber vom aktuellen Stand her bin ich nicht optimistisch. Wenn du irgendwie so ein Spiel wie dieses unbedingt haben willst, würde ich dir empfehlen, Victoria 3 auszuprobieren, sobald es rauskommt.

Saw the negative reviews but, having waited quite a while for this game, bought it to check it out anyway. I thought to myself, ""Surely, even if it is bad, it can't be soooo bad, right? I mean, it's a map game!"" Well yes. Yes it can be so bad. The UI is absurdly large, the game runs less than acceptably for my specs, and the map is super difficult to easily interact with. I only could stand to play the game for 10 minutes or so, so I unfortunately can't speak to some of the games deeper problems, but from the initial overview it's very possibly inferior to the last game by quite a large margin, having seemingly adding nothing, instead losing things - I mean, you can't even control the game speed! In a grand strategy game!

The user interface is far too large, as if it were designed for mobile games. Interacting with the map is very difficult, as if my mouse clicks are only registered sporadically. The game isn't particularly well optimized either, and it doesn't run as fast as it should on my computer. I could only manage about 10 minutes of play before I simply couldn't tolerate it any longer. Unfortunately, I can't comment on the deeper aspects of the game because, as I said, I simply don't want to play it. Nevertheless, it looks like the predecessor is the better game overall. Many things I wanted are missing, and even old features aren't fully present – ​​I mean, you can't even change the speed! Really! You can either pause or let it run, but you can't really speed it up or slow it down.

Hopefully, the game will improve over time, but as it stands, I'm not optimistic. If you really want a game like this, I'd recommend trying Victoria 3 when it's released.

Los modos de mapa funcionan como quieren, por no hablar de la UI en general, que entre que es confusa y que los botones y sliders tienen lag se hace horrible.
Puedes literalmente hacer que la industria de madera sea ilegal (????) entre otras cosas sin sentido. Muy pocas leyes nacionales (6), y solo 5 tipos de tratados internacionales.
Con EEUU, la OTAN irónicamente se une si atacas a otros países sin justificación previa. Puedes subir los impuestos del 23 % al 50 % (que es un único porcentaje, no hay tasas específicas en nada) y declararle la guerra a medio mundo sin justificación, que subirá la opinión de los habitantes si gastas suficiente dinero en propaganda.

En resumen: Muy desbalanceado, confuso y falto de contenido. Claramente inferior a la anterior entrega, incluso aunque esta tuviera sus errores. Ya de por si la interacción desarrolladores-comunidad era extraña: Q&As y 1 trailer a principio de año seguido de meses de vacío hasta 1 mes antes del lanzamiento, donde lanzaron el resto de trailers, que eran básicamente las mismas animaciones repetidas durante 3 minutos.
No me extraña que se insista tanto en los modders y el soporte de Workshop: Pretenden que la comunidad les complete el juego

Edit: Prueba gráfica de los problemas con las políticas internas: https://youtu.be/pCpcAD5XxUQ?t=2161","The performance is AWFUL after a few years, despite having a PC that far exceeds the recommended requirements.
The map modes are completely unreliable, not to mention the UI in general, which is confusing and has laggy buttons and sliders, making it a nightmare.
You can literally make the timber industry illegal (????) among other nonsensical things. Very few national laws (6), and only 5 types of international treaties.
With the US, NATO ironically joins if you attack other countries without prior justification. You can raise taxes from 23% to 50% (which is a single percentage; there are no specific rates for anything) and declare war on half the world without justification, which will boost public opinion if you spend enough money on propaganda.

In short: Very unbalanced, confusing, and lacking in content. Clearly inferior to the previous installment, even though that one had its flaws. The developer-community interaction was already strange: Q&As and one trailer at the beginning of the year, followed by months of silence until a month before launch, when they released the rest of the trailers, which were basically the same animations repeated for three minutes.
It's no wonder they're so focused on modders and Workshop support: They expect the community to complete the game for them.

- military ships absolutely do not correspond to reality. SP is in real simulation not approximations like GPS3
- during a war, countries have 30 allies when in reality not really (e.g. Morocco), it's absurd
- Agérie with Floréal ^^ class frigates, PT-76 tanks and only 3 submarines against 6 real.
- purchased units that remain blocked

What makes it nearly unplayable:
-Army movements to region, some troops seem to disapear or move along with troops passing by
-Thematic Maps: There is a lack of clarity and uniformity. Insteat of using colors from light blue to blue they should use green over yellow to red
Especially the empire map views you can't see the needed information - Enemy should be red, my country should white, allies blue...  

Things making it easier:
-posibility to occupy all the country with spreading (by splitting the amrys) to all the regions of the country

Wishlist:
-MODDING: Editor for Regions including Borders
-Sea borders, national and international waters
-Peaceful annexations of regions and states (via money, several goals like same culture and language, former belonging to a state...)
-Game speed: high, normal, low, pause
-if possible front lines
-deeper zoom in
-Borders around regions und states.
-Capital cities and government seat

Ethnicity:
-European complex, why no more nationalities? 
-Good idea whit social groups, but it should be more like this: 
Europeans->GermanicPeople->Germans->Bavarians
Europeans->Romans->Italian...
or, if too complex
European->Germans/Italians/...
-Better realtionships within ethnic groups and languages
-Social groups additional to nationalities or ethnic groups.

Popups:
-Not every message needs a popup box. The message should only show up in the ticker down below.

Known bugs:
-Social Groups pie diagram is buggy

Very Nice:
-Satellite view
-Highways (dispite the missing trains)

The game should be more like SP2 but with better graphics.

Please don't hesitate to comment my statements.

I will change my recommentation for this product as soon as it improves.","Unfortunately, I can't recommend this game at the moment, but I see clear potential for improvement here.
Hence my request to the manufacturer - sit down and work on it here.

Of course, many (including myself) were looking forward to the release of the game, but like many, I was hugely disappointed. I have never bought such an unfinished game. In the age of the Internet, it wouldn't be so bad if an open beta had been started and this development status had been published there.

What makes it nearly unplayable:
-Army movements to region, some troops seem to disapear or move along with troops passing by
-Thematic Maps: There is a lack of clarity and uniformity. Insteat of using colors from light blue to blue they should use green over yellow to red
Especially the empire map views you can't see the needed information - Enemy should be red, my country should be white, allies blue...

Artılar:
-Yok

Eksiler:
-Ekonomi menüsü rezalet, yaptığınız hiçbir ayar ekonomiyi değiştirmiyor.
-Askerleri bir yere göndermek veya saldırmak işkence, havaalanlarındaki askerlere uçak simgesi yüzünden tıklayamıyorsunuz bile.
-Sandbox modu 2018'de başlıyor ama şu anki dünya ile hiçbir alakası bile yok. Ne Suriye İç Savaşı, ne ukrayna rusya savaşı, sanki havadan vahiy gelmişte tüm insanlık barışmış.
-2004 yılındaki oyununda bile olan Avrupa Birliği, NATO tarzı hiçbir örgüt yok.
-Ülkeler arası ilişki için seçenekler yok denecek kadar az. İlişki geliştirmek istiyorsanız gidin ülkeye 2-3 para gönderin bu kadar basit.
-Çok fazla bug var. Türkiye ile oynarken Suriyeyi işgal ettim ve bölgede bulunan rus askerleri ne işgal ettiğim yerlerden çekildi ne de bir etkileşime girdi.
-AI aşırı mal. ABD ile ispanyayı nukeliyorum kimsenin sikinde değil. savaşta da çok kötüler.
-Fiyat olarak max 50 TL lik bir oyun şu anki haliyle bu fiyatı hak etmiyor.

Son olarak, umarım tüm bu eksiler sırf oyun yeni çıktığı içindir çünkü şu anki haliyle Super Power 2'den farksız bir oyun.
İlle almak istiyorum diyorsanız bundan 3-4 ay sonra alın belki bir umut tüm bu problemleri çözerler.

Вместо этого разрабы решили все испортить. Положительных аспектов здесь нет, поломано и криво все. Кроме того совершенно очевидно, что игра делалась изначально под смартфоны, но ее решили натянуть и на ПК, выдает это в ней не информативный интерфейс с окошками на весь экран и гигантскими кнопками. 
Игра играет сама в себе и при этом не очень успешно. Совсем не очевидно, как различные параметры влияют друг на друга и есть ли это влияние в принципе.

Expectations weren't sky-high; they could have picked up the second installment, fixed its known bugs and features, refined the combat and diplomacy, beefed up the graphics, and that would have been enough.

Instead, the developers decided to ruin everything. There are no positive aspects here; everything is broken and glitchy. Furthermore, it's quite obvious that the game was originally designed for smartphones, but they decided to port it to PC, as evidenced by its uninformative interface with full-screen windows and giant buttons.

The game plays within itself, and not very well. It's not at all clear how the various parameters interact with each other, or whether they even interact at all.

Thematic maps are terrible, the combat has gotten even worse, though you'd think it could get worse. You can't choose the game speed, choose a political party at the start, or change the political regime...
In short, you don't need this, guys. This all looks like a scam: an unfinished piece of a mobile game is being handed to us as a sequel to a good old game that many of us have fond memories of.
Don't be fooled, maybe in a year or two it will be playable...although, I think they'll simply abandon the game after such a disappointing release, making a few bucks off those unlucky enough to stick with it for more than two hours.

Ich weiß nicht wie ein Spiel, oder was auch immer das hier mal werden sollte, in einem solchen Zustand veröffentlicht werden kann. 

Ich versuche dennoch kurz in Worte zu fassen was alles nicht funktioniert
- Einstellungen für Grafik sind kaputt. Man kann unter Vollscreen die Auflösung nicht ändern
- Einstellungen von Anfang an so eingestellt dass man nicht nah ran zoomen kann an Einheiten oder Städte, man denkt das Feature ist einfach gar nicht da. 
- Alle Entscheidungen der Regierung wirken sofort. Demokratie einfach in Diktatur umwandeln in 1 Tag. Öffentliche Medien privatisieren. Kühe für 3 Billionen in 2 Sekunden einkaufen.. No Problemo! 
- Krieg ist erschreckend schlecht. Einheiten sind zwar nun visuell erfassbar, aber diese zu bewegen ist schrecklich und buggy. 
- Wenn Gegner aufeinander treffen wird eine Kampfregion abgesteckt wo sich Kampfverbände, als Knubbel, gegenseitig anfahren und beschießen. Komischerweise können Langstrecken Waffen keine Schiffe attackieren und so viele mehr logische Fehler gibt es hier. 
- Es gibt nur eine Spielgeschwindigkeit und die wirkt manchmal zu schnell. Es wurde auch versäumt Pausieren auf irgendeine Taste zu legen. Oder eine sinvolle Taste zu legen. Leertaste für Stop/Go oder ""P"" sind es jedenfalls nicht..

Positiv an dem Spiel ist übrigens!
- Ich kann 100 Atombomben auf ein Land schmeißen und keinen juckt es
- Der Charaktereditor ist ganz nett

Beide Punkte machen ca. 15 Minuten Spaß und dann kann man nun 2 Jahre warten bis das Spiel vielleicht mal ein Spiel wird.","I'm speechless.

I don't know how a game, or whatever this was supposed to be, could be released in such a state.

Nevertheless, I'll try to briefly describe everything that doesn't work:

- The graphics settings are broken. You can't change the resolution in fullscreen mode.

- The settings are configured from the start so that you can't zoom in on units or cities; it's as if the feature simply isn't there.

- All government decisions take effect immediately. Easily convert democracy into dictatorship in one day. Privatize public media. Buy cows for 3 trillion in 2 seconds... No problem!

- Warfare is appallingly bad. Units are now visually identifiable, but moving them is terrible and buggy.

- When enemies meet, a combat zone is defined where combat units, in a cluster, drive towards and fire on each other. Oddly enough, long-range weapons can't attack ships, and there are so many more logical errors.

- There's only one game speed, and it sometimes feels too fast. They also failed to assign the pause function to any key. Or to assign a sensible key at all. The spacebar for stop/go or ""P"" certainly aren't options.

On the positive side, though!

- I can drop 100 atomic bombs on a country and nobody cares.

- The character editor is quite nice.

Both of these features provide about 15 minutes of fun, and then we can wait two years until the game maybe actually becomes a game."

Just character customization that I don't know why it exists, a sudden slowdown that makes me wonder if it's optimized, no time acceleration, Korean is officially supported but the translation is somehow sloppy, the map zoom is worse than in Part 2, why is the Andorran flag on Baekdu Mountain, the country that was completely merged and destroyed keeps appearing as an enemy and is constantly at war, you can't choose the ruling party when you start, the army can't be disbanded and spies can only do counterintelligence and training, the army deployment is like this, merging the same type is also like this, at least tanks and self-propelled guns should be differentiated but that's not there, in Part 2 you could select everything when concluding a treaty with a foreign country, but now when the hell did they sit down to do all those countries one by one?"

저 역시 이 게임을 10년간 기다려온 많은 슈퍼파워2 팬들중 한 명 입니다. 하지만 아직 이 게임은 구매하지 않는 것이 좋을 것 같습니다. 다만 저 ""아직""이라는 표현 역시도 그저 저의 헛된 희망이 섞인 것 이라서 차라리 슈퍼파워2의 리마스터를 기다리는게 좋겠다는 생각도 듭니다. 그럼 추천하지 않는 이유들은 간단히 다음과 같습니다.

직관성의 퇴보, 조작감의 퇴보, 현실성의 퇴보, 최적화 문제.

이 네가지가 왜 문제인지 자세히 나열하겠습니다.

1.# 직관성의 퇴보
기존 슈퍼파워2의 경우 플레이어가 ""무엇""을 ""어떻게"" 했으며 그 ""결과"" 까지 매우 직접적으로 알기 쉽게 보여줍니다. 오직 텍스트, 숫자, 그래프만 가지고 말이죠. 슈퍼파워3는 플레이어가 ""무엇""을 ""어떻게"" 해야하는지 조차 기존 팬들이라면 접근이 어렵습니다. 목록으로 간단하게 나열했던 항목들은 아이콘을 넣어서 굳이 그 아이콘을 누르고 들어가야만 투자가 가능하게끔 만들었고 그 투자로 인해 어떤 변화가 나타나는지 직접적으로 체감하기 매우 어렵습니다. 

또한 국내에 큰 영향을 주는 정책을 합법이냐 불법이냐 조정하는 것 역시 전작에 비해 모든 항목을 개별적으로 들어가야 세부 내용에서 조절이 가능하고 정치 메뉴에서 한 눈에 보여지는 부분은 매우 한정되기 때문에 오히려 전작 대비 세밀한 정도가 크게 퇴보한 기분까지 줍니다.

더욱이 특정 국가와 조약을 체결하고자 하더라도 ""중복선택""이 불가능 하기 때문에 한번에 하나씩 계속 반복작업을 해줘야 합니다. 예를들어 프랑스 영국 이탈리아와 대사관을 만들자는 조약을 체결하려고 하면 프랑스,영국,이탈리아 중복 선택에서 요청을 하는 것이 아니라 프랑스에 요청, 영국에 요청, 이탈리아에 요청해야 하는 상황입니다. 중복선택의 다른 방법이 있을지는 모르겠지만 슈퍼파워2는 처음 키더라도 중복선택은 이렇게 하면 되는구나 하고 매우 쉽게 알 수 있었죠? 직관성의 퇴보 맞습니다.

덤으로 유닛도 한 군데에 뭉쳐있는 부대를 ""일괄 분할"" 하는 것이 불가능합니다. 이래도 직관성의 퇴보 아니라고 하면 반박시 니가 골렘랩스 개발자입니다. 사과하시면 됩니다.

2.# 조작감의 퇴보
슬라이더가 반응이 늦는 부분은.. 최적화때 얘기하기로 하고 조작감이 너무 떨어졌습니다. 일단 지도 확대가 생각만큼 안됩니다. 덤으로 유닛을 표현하는 아이콘은 전작보다 커졌습니다. 무슨 얘기냐, 군부대 둘이 겹쳐있으면 죽었다 깨어나도 아래 가려져 있는 유닛을 선택할 수 없습니다. 덤으로 직관성이 떨어지다 보니 내가 무언가 하기 위해서는 전작에 비해 ""메뉴를 찾는 시간""이 더 들어가버려서 기존 팬들은 조작이 어렵다고 느낄 수 밖에 없습니다. 기존 팬 분들은 이 게임을 ""슈퍼파워""3가 아니라 ""슈파파워3"" 라는 이름의 새로운 게임이라고 생각하시는게 좋습니다.

3.# 현실성의 퇴보
한국인이기에 가장 먼저 눈치챌 수 밖에 없는 부분입니다만... 네 북한과 현재 ""휴전중""으로 나오지 않으며 ""평화"" 상태로 되어 있습니다. 이는 너무 현실과 동떨어져있죠. 

4.# 최적화 문제
진짜... 그래픽 별로 좋지도 않은 상태에서 제 모니터 주사율 떨어지는거 처음봅니다. 얼마 전 스팀에서 진행한 ""발매 예정 게임""들 모아서 미리 해보기 가능하게끔 이벤트로 만들어놨던... 뭐 아무튼 그런 데모 하나 받아서 했는데 그 게임이 더 잘 돌아갑니다... i7에 2070 물려 쓰고 있어 어지간한 게임들은 주사율 떨어지는거 본적 없는데... 그래서 슬라이드 조정해도 마우스 입력보다 한참 딜레이 돼서 적용됩니다. 

저는 일단 ""팬심"" 으로 설치는 해두고 리뷰 작성 이후에도 오늘은 최소 몇 시간 정도는 더 플레이 해 볼 생각입니다. 하지만 그 뒤 삭제하고 슈퍼파워2 스팀 버전이나 구매 해볼까 생각중입니다. 기존 게임 팬 분들도 어지간하면 구입하지 마시고, 구입 하시더라도 2시간이내 그냥 환불 받으시고 한 1년~2년 뒤쯤 70%이상 할인 때리면 그때 받아보시는걸 추천합니다.","If you're considering buying this game, be sure to check it out first!!

I'm one of the many Super Power 2 fans who've been waiting for this game for 10 years. However, I recommend against buying it just yet. However, the word ""yet"" is just my own vain hope, so I think it's better to wait for the Super Power 2 remaster. Here are the reasons I don't recommend it:

Decreased intuitiveness, decreased control, decreased realism, and optimization issues.

I'll list these four issues in detail.

1. # Decreased intuitiveness
The original Super Power 2 showed the player ""what"" and ""how"" they did it, as well as the ""results"", very directly and easily, using only text, numbers, and graphs. Super Power 3 makes it difficult for existing fans to even understand ""what"" and ""how"" the player should do it. Items that were previously simply listed have been replaced with icons, forcing you to click on them to invest. This makes it difficult to directly perceive the changes resulting from those investments.

Furthermore, adjusting policies with significant domestic impact, such as legality or illegality, requires individual adjustments to each item, unlike in the previous game. The politics menu only displays a very limited amount of information at a glance, making it feel like a significant step backwards in detail.

Furthermore, even if you want to conclude a treaty with a specific country, you can't ""multiple selection""—you have to repeatedly select each country one at a time. For example, if you want to establish an embassy with France, the UK, or Italy, you can't request multiple selections from France, the UK, or Italy. Instead, you have to request France, the UK, and then Italy. While there may be other ways to do this, even for a first-time Superpower 2 player, it's incredibly easy to understand how to do this. It's a significant regression in intuitiveness.

Furthermore, you can't ""bulk split"" units that are clustered together. If you still insist this isn't a regression in intuitiveness, then you're the developer of Golem Labs. Just apologize.

2.# Regression in Controls
The slider's lag is... I'll address that during optimization, but the controls are seriously lacking. First of all, the map zoom isn't as smooth as expected. Plus, the icons representing units are larger than in the previous game. What I mean is, if two military units overlap, you can't select the hidden unit even after reviving. Furthermore, the lack of intuitiveness means it takes longer to ""find the menu"" to do anything compared to the previous game, making it difficult for existing fans to navigate. Existing fans should think of this game as a new title, ""Super Power 3,"" not ""Super Power"" 3.

3.# Regression in Realism
This is the first thing you'll notice as a Korean... Yes, North Korea and the game aren't currently listed as ""in a state of armistice,"" but rather ""at peace."" That's incredibly unrealistic.

4. # Optimization Issues
Seriously... I've never seen my monitor's refresh rate drop with such poor graphics. A while ago, Steam hosted an event where they collected ""upcoming games"" and offered early access... Well, I received a demo of that, and that game ran much better. I'm using an i7 and a 2070, so I haven't seen any drops in refresh rates in most games. So, even when I adjust the slider, there's a significant delay compared to mouse input.

I'm installing it for now as a ""fan"" and plan to play it for at least a few more hours today, even after writing this review. However, I'm thinking about deleting it and buying the Steam version of Superpower 2. Even for existing game fans, I recommend avoiding the game if possible. Even if you do buy it, get a refund within two hours and wait a year or two for it to be discounted by 70% or more before you buy it."

I waited so damn long for a sequel to SuperPower 2... I wanted to like this game so bad. But it's completely void of things to do. IT NEEDS AN EARLY ACCESS TAG! 

Basically the only goals at the moment in this game are to;

1. Increase GDP / Money by 'boosting' resources such as fuel or gas or plants or cereals. The assets here are really really limited. It feels like there should be tons more. Basically the economy UI exists entirely in two different menus, one of which has your taxes and budget, the other has sectors you can invest in. Very lackluster.

2. Increase your army size by buying or building more units. You can also research, but this is limited simply to new 'levels' of technology. Ie, you cant change your units weaponry or customise them at all, just make new unit designs with different tech levels affecting their cost to build. Again, lackluster and not much content around it. Far more development needed to make this system interesting, including unit customisation and research options beyond what is currently offered.

3. Invading other nations. This links in to the above. It feels very barebones. AI is slow. Nothing really, 'happens' per-se in the game-world. I played as Australia and my units were for some reason in the sea near the Phillipines (nearly all of my navy), I wasn't allied or even friendly with nations we are IRL. Was incredibly off. I declared war on and invaded New Zealand and Malaysia declared war on me. 

That is all that happened. No game events. No immersion. No world building. Even the combat and process of invading was boring. No 'occupy all' right click context command, so you have to manually split units and put them into individual provinces so the enemy nation 'loses control' of it, at which point you annex it through your national legislation and laws menu or whatever it is. 

It's all very, weird.

Some of the things in this game 'seem' appealing, such as the human development stat tracking but its all meat and no bones. There is nothing backing all these flashy looking things to make them worthwhile.

You can't build anything. No new airbases. No nothing in that form of gameplay. 

The world map looks a bit unfinished in my opinion, too.

Also, bugs. When launching, the game forces full screen 7680x1440. I changed to windowed 1920x1080 and now upon opening the game again the next day, it forced full screen and stretched 1920x1080 instead so now the UI is messed up and only two buttons are visible, none of which are the settings to fix it. That's great.

Overall, not impressed. I didn't refund it though. Potential is there, and it was only $30.","This is meant to be a relatively thorough review.

Le concept est tellement attirant, le teaser présente un jeu complet, on se dit naïvement que THQ est allé voir du coté des concurrents pour voir ce qui se fait (Paradox Interactive ou Creative Assembly...). On se rêve déjà dirigeant d'une grande nation puis on lance le jeu et on devient dirigeant... d'un étron virtuel.

Mon évaluation vous paraît peut-être un poil orienté pour le moment alors je vais développer un peu. Le createur de personnage est bref. C'est une étape dispensable dans laquelle vous choisissez votre physique, votre langue, votre pays et votre religion. C'est tout. Vous ne reverrez pas votre personnage et ces caractéristiques sont aussi peu nombreuses qu'inutiles. 

Ensuite, la partie se lance (après un chargement relativement long) et c'est le drame. Première chose à savoir, c'est l'absence totale de tutoriel ou d'interaction dynamique avec le joueur (ce qui est [b]OBLIGATOIRE[/b] pour tout jeu de grande stratégie). Vous êtes sur une carte du monde, lancé dans le vide avec une UI qui malgré son apparence ""correcte"" manque de profondeur (pas de surbrillance, pas d'animation, pas de pop up). Le temps défile en jour et il n'y a ni avance rapide, ni raccourci pour le mettre en pause.

Les options sont nombreuses, vous allez commencer à faire le curieux, ajuster des paramètres de votre économie, votre diplomatie, votre politique [strike]et votre armée[/strike] mais rien ne se passera vraiment. Les chiffres bougent, certes... c'est à peu prés tout. Immersion inexistante. Interactions inexistantes.

J'ai passé des milliers d'heures sur CK, les Civ, Hearts of Iron, Total War etc. Ce jeu n'arrive pas à la cheville de n'importe lequel de ces jeux. C'est vide, mal optimisé, moche et mensonger. Aujourd'hui, les éditeurs se permettent de nous pondre ces horreurs avec un joli teaser papier cadeau sans même les faire tester. J'ai réellement tenté de creuser mais je n'y ai trouvé qu'une perte de temps et d'argent. J'aurais préféré passer ces quelques heures à [strike]sculpter un phallus en pâte fimo[/strike] dormir, ça aurait été bien plus constructif. 

Certains espèrent que des ""update"" pourront améliorer l'état actuel du jeu et c'est la toute première fois de ma vie que je vous répondrais : Non, aucune mise à jour ne saurait rétablir cette maison en feu. [b]Le carnage est profond et l'arnaque est avéré.[/b]","[h1] The Shame of Simulation. [/h1]

The concept is so appealing, the teaser presents a complete game, and we naively assume that THQ has looked to the competition to see what's out there (Paradox Interactive or Creative Assembly...). We already dream of leading a great nation, then we launch the game and become the leader... of a virtual turd.

My assessment might seem a bit biased at the moment, so I'll elaborate a bit. The character creator is brief. It's a dispensable step in which you choose your appearance, language, country, and religion. That's it. You won't see your character again, and these characteristics are as few as they are useless.

Then, the game starts (after a relatively long loading time), and that's where the trouble begins. The first thing to know is the complete absence of a tutorial or dynamic interaction with the player (which is [b]ESSENTIAL[/b] for any grand strategy game). You're on a world map, adrift in a void with a UI that, despite its ""decent"" appearance, lacks depth (no highlighting, no animations, no pop-ups). Time passes in days, and there's no fast-forward or shortcut to pause.

The options are numerous, and you'll start to get curious, adjusting parameters for your economy, diplomacy, politics, and army, but nothing really happens. The numbers change, sure... that's about it. Nonexistent immersion. Nonexistent interactions.

I've spent thousands of hours on Knight Rider, Civilization, Hearts of Iron, Total War, etc. This game doesn't even come close to any of them. It's empty, poorly optimized, ugly, and misleading. These days, publishers can churn out these monstrosities with a pretty, presentable teaser without even letting us play them. I actually tried to dig deeper, but all I found was a waste of time and money. I would have preferred to spend those few hours [strike]sculpting a phallus out of polymer clay[/strike] sleeping; that would have been much more productive.

Some hope that ""updates"" will improve the current state of the game, and this is the very first time in my life that I'll tell you: No, no update can ever fix this burning house. [b]The carnage is profound, and the scam is undeniable.[/b]"

1.首先开发商的经济学可以说是领先人类文明至少一个世纪，因为在税率跟开局一样的情况下，居然会出现GDP涨了五倍收入还跟开局一样的情况，那要是这样各国干嘛还要发展经济？反正GDP涨了收入却不会跟着涨，甚至还会跌下去的情况，似乎就玩家有这个bug，之前我用中国GDP是77万亿美金，美国GDP是24万亿美金，但是我就算把税收拉到百分之百收入也没有美国高，如果不是bug的话只能解释为美国税率已经高于一百了，并且这个Bug属于常规现象，基本上每一局都能遇到。

2.其次则是政体和首都之流都无法改变，我看游戏提示说君主制国家可以改为民选，但我试的国家都不是君主制的，比如说中国在该游戏就不可能民主化，就算把中国政治搞的比美国还开放，网络游行什么的全面打开也不能换政体（实际上2也有这个问题，但2是bug，朝鲜伊朗均可以换为多党民主，3是就不支持换政体），所以如果按照开发商那神奇的理论，那么现在台湾和韩国应该还是党国一体制度，而二战也不会爆发，因为那个艺术生没法把魏玛德国给换掉（顺带一提，政体还有个bug那就是只选举一次，选举完那次后似乎没有国家有选举意愿了，甚至会出现距离大选还有-6个月的神奇情况）

3.军事方面则可以说是断崖式下降，首先就是极其恶心的操作界面，空军需要一个个手动挪到机场去，而陆军和海军移动不光比2费劲的多且bug频出，经常赖在原地不动了，然后攻占也是十分的难受，在2里面只要不是个瞎子都能看清楚自己占领了哪里，但是在3里面想看清自己占领了哪里基本不可能，并且不知道开发商是否是出于恶趣味，把原来那个占领国土的功能给删了，导致你如果想占领那个国家，需要手动一点点的操纵部队去占领各个领土，这个在打台湾的时候就深有体会，相比于2的落魄情况，3里面中国的经济和军事都仅次于老美，开局调完部队就能迅速干废国军，但是打国军容易，要占领台湾需要手动的操纵部队占据地区，操纵部队占领的时间比打的时间要长的多，在耗尽4年的时间终于占领了台湾全境后，我看了看剩下的一百多个国家和他们境内密密麻麻的地区，就默默的就放弃了统一世界的大业。

4.跟军事一样，外交也是大崩塌中的大崩塌，2里面那些丰富的国际组织什么北约联合国之类的都消失了，取而代之的是极其简略的外交界面，以及一堆令人无语的乞丐国家，国家之间的简单外交似乎只能涉及两人，不能有第三个国家参与，并且只要玩一会儿就有乞丐国家来要钱，有时候是给钱让答应某个条件，有时候就是干脆单纯的要钱，也不知道谁给他们的自信，这不要脸程度台湾那些邦交国都得叫声爹 ，我要是能有这不要脸的讨饭能力的话，估计能靠做乞丐实现财务自由。

5. 同时开发商的颜色判别能力就如同他们的经济学一样，是领先了人类现有水平至少一个世纪的，在2里面无论是看资源产出，各国关系还是人口密度都很容易，因为不同程度的颜色差距是很鲜明的，但是3不知道为什么放弃了这一点，采用了近乎一样的颜色，所以当你想看不同地区之间各方面的差异，就会发现基本上都是一个颜色的。

6.捏人则是屁用没有，刚开始发出这个功能的时候我就奇怪过，又不是模拟人生这种游戏，为什么一个模拟国家的游戏会需要捏人系统呢？后来我的猜测果然是正确的，这个功能果然没用，在捏玩那个人后你就再也看不见他了，他对于国家的影响也近乎为零，并且开发商费劲做了个没用的捏人系统，却把选择开局政党的功能给删掉了（似乎不能选择初始政党），再也没有小政党逆袭的机会了。

7. 新加进来的功能大半也是无用的，且比2更加的可笑，比如说近乎没用的移民系统，我死活也想不明白，一个人均收入跟美国差不多高，且在政治方面比美国要开放的升级版中国，为什么就是一个移民也吸引不到呢？难道中国想做种族大熔炉都不行？好歹现实世界的广东还有偷渡的外国人呢，这咋中国都比美国发达了，却连移民都吸引不到了，是只有老美才有资格吸收移民不成？至于代替了语言和宗教的人种分类更是可笑至极，开发商再一次把至少一个世纪后的理论拿到了现在，我活了这么久第还是一次听说台湾人种和香港人种这两个人种的存在，这种奇葩理论可以说是蔡英文都不敢讲，人家台湾政府自己还说百分九十六的人口是汉族人呢，更何况韩国跟朝鲜还是两个主权国家呢，不都是朝鲜族构成的？

8. 说回基础的游戏性方面，supershit3除了满天飞的bug以外，就是十分严重的卡顿，这是有一个独特与2的特点，不知道是我电脑太差了，还是游戏高级到已经超出现代人类计算机的水平了，反正画质调到最低也时不时的卡顿一下，而且时不时还伴随着bug一起出现，给玩家一个惊喜，但我就寻思我这电脑玩群星后期都不会卡成这样的呀，难道这游戏就这么高级？

9. 当然要说它一点优点都没有，我还是不赞成的，毕竟这游戏开发时间1年多了，人家坤坤练习两年半都能打个篮球，所以稍微有点进步也是正常的，首先新加的污染，可耕地限制，互联网和媒体控制就不错，其次产业发展规律和产业类型也比2要合理的多，比起2那种黑科技的直接投资模式，3这种给予补贴升级产业链明显更加科学，毕竟工厂扩建和升级都要时间嘛，怎么可能一秒就搞定，同时比起2，3还充分体现了科学技术在生产方面的重要性，比如说美国开局人均生产力比中国高好几倍，所以似乎不会出现人多无脑堆经济和无脑投资产业堆经济的情况了，而且能跟其他国家进行资源贸易也是比2更加现实的设置。

最后总而言之，supershit3就是一堆shit，就跟鲁迅那句话一样，有缺点的战士依旧是战士，完美的苍蝇还是一只苍蝇，如果2是战士的话，那么3就是苍蝇，对了给开发商一点建议，实在不知道怎么做的话就直接原封不动的复制superpower2，把UI界面和图像给优化下，然后把现在各国的数据给加进去，最后再删除点bug，做出来的成品绝对比现在这个好的多。","There are just too many things to complain about regarding Supershit3. After waiting for half a year, this is the thing they released; I have to rant about it.

1. First of all, the developers' economics is at least a century ahead of human civilization. Because, with the tax rate the same as at the start, there are instances where GDP increases fivefold while income remains the same. If that's the case, why would countries bother developing their economies? Since GDP increases but income doesn't rise accordingly, and might even fall, it seems only players experience this bug. Previously, I used a game where China's GDP was 77 trillion USD and the US GDP was 24 trillion USD, but even with 100% taxation, my income wasn't as high as the US's. If this isn't a bug, it can only be explained by the US tax rate already being higher than 100%. And this bug is a common occurrence; it happens in almost every game.


2. Secondly, the political system and capital city cannot be changed. The game hints that monarchies can be changed to democratic systems, but none of the countries I tried were monarchies. For example, China cannot be democratized in this game. Even if you make Chinese politics more open than the US, and fully enable online protests, you still can't change the political system (actually, there's a similar problem in point 2, but it's a bug; North Korea and Iran can be changed to multi-party democracies, while point 3 doesn't support changing the political system). So, according to the developer's bizarre theory, Taiwan and South Korea should still be under a party-state system, and World War II wouldn't have broken out because that art student couldn't change Weimar Germany. (Incidentally, there's another bug with the political system: there's only one election, and after that, no country seems to have the will to hold elections, even resulting in a bizarre situation where there are -6 months until the next election).

3. The military aspect is a precipitous decline. First, the interface is extremely cumbersome; air force units need to be manually moved to the airport one by one. The movement of the army and navy is not only much more cumbersome than in version 2, but also riddled with bugs, often getting stuck in place. Conquering territory is also extremely frustrating. In version 2, anyone with eyes could clearly see where they had occupied territory, but in version 3, it's practically impossible. Furthermore, perhaps out of a mischievous sense of humor, the developers removed the original territorial conquest function. This means that to conquer a country, you need to manually manipulate troops to occupy each territory bit by bit. I experienced this firsthand when attacking Taiwan. Compared to the dire situation in version 2, China's economy and military in version 3 are second only to the US. After deploying troops at the start, I could quickly cripple the KMT army. However, while attacking the KMT army was easy, conquering Taiwan required manually manipulating troops to occupy areas, and this process took much longer than the actual fighting. After spending four years finally conquering the entirety of Taiwan, I looked at the remaining hundred-plus countries and their densely packed territories, and silently gave up on the grand ambition of unifying the world.

4. Like the military aspect, diplomacy is a complete collapse. The rich international organizations of the second game, like NATO and the UN, have vanished, replaced by an extremely rudimentary diplomatic interface and a bunch of ridiculously poor nations. Simple diplomacy between countries seems limited to two-way communication, with no third party allowed. And after playing for a short while, a poor nation will come begging for money—sometimes offering money in exchange for certain conditions, sometimes simply asking for money outright. I don't know where they get their confidence; their shamelessness is so extreme that even Taiwan's diplomatic allies would have to call them ""daddy."" If I had that kind of shamelessness in begging, I could probably achieve financial freedom as a beggar.

5. Meanwhile, the developers' color-coding ability, like their economics, is at least a century ahead of current human capabilities. In the second game, it was easy to observe resource output, inter-state relations, and population density because the differences in color were very clear. But in the third game, for some reason, this was abandoned, using almost uniform colors. So when you try to see differences between different regions, you'll find they're basically all the same color.

6. Character creation is utterly useless. I was puzzled when this feature was first released. It's not like The Sims; why would a game simulating a nation need a character creation system? My guess was correct. This feature is indeed useless. Once you create your character, you never see them again, and their impact on the nation is almost zero. Furthermore, the developers went to the trouble of creating a useless character creation system while removing the option to choose your starting party (it seems you can't choose your initial party), eliminating any chance for smaller parties to rise to power.

7. Most of the newly added features are also useless, even more ridiculous than point 2. For example, the almost useless immigration system. I simply can't understand why an upgraded version of China, with a per capita income roughly equal to that of the US and a more politically open stance, can't attract any immigrants. Does China not even want to be a melting pot of races? Even in the real world, Guangdong has illegal immigrants. How come China, which is more developed than the US, can't attract immigrants? Is it only Americans who are qualified to absorb immigrants? As for the racial classification that replaces language and religion, it's utterly ridiculous. The developers have once again brought theories from at least a century into the present. In all my years, this is the first time I've ever heard of the existence of ""Taiwanese"" and ""Hong Kong"" races. This bizarre theory is something even Tsai Ing-wen wouldn't dare utter. The Taiwanese government itself says that 96% of its population is Han Chinese. Moreover, South Korea and North Korea are two sovereign states, both composed of Koreans.

8. Returning to the basic gameplay, besides the rampant bugs, Supershit 3 suffers from extremely severe lag. This has a unique characteristic: I don't know if my computer is too weak, or if the game is so advanced that it's beyond the capabilities of modern computers. Anyway, even with the graphics settings at their lowest, it still lags frequently, often accompanied by bugs, giving players a surprise. But I think my computer doesn't lag this much even in the late game of Stellaris. Is this game really that advanced?

9. Of course, I wouldn't agree that it has no merits at all. After all, this game has been in development for over a year, and someone like Kun Kun could play basketball after two and a half years of practice, so some progress is normal. First, the newly added pollution, arable land restrictions, and internet and media control are quite good. Second, the industrial development patterns and types are much more reasonable than in game 2. Compared to the direct investment model of ""black technology"" in game 2, the subsidy-based upgrade of the industrial chain in game 3 is clearly more scientific. After all, factory expansion and upgrades take time; they can't be done in a second. Also, compared to game 2, game 3 fully demonstrates the importance of science and technology in production. For example, the US's per capita productivity is several times higher than China's at the start, so it seems unlikely that there will be a situation where people blindly rush into economic development or blindly invest in industries to build up the economy. Furthermore, the ability to trade resources with other countries is a more realistic setting than in game 2.

In conclusion, SuperShit3 is a pile of shit. Just like Lu Xun said, a flawed warrior is still a warrior, and a perfect fly is still a fly. If SuperShit2 is a warrior, then SuperShit3 is a fly. By the way, here's a suggestion for the developers: if you really don't know what to do, just copy SuperPower2 exactly, optimize the UI and graphics, add data from various countries, and finally delete some bugs. The finished product will definitely be much better than the current one."

Das einzige Gameplay, das dieses Spiel aktuell bietet, ist es, Regler zu verschieben.
Aber selbst für nen 'Regler verschiebe Simulator' würde dieses Game nichts taugen, da selbst diese simple Funktion laggt wie Hölle.

Klar, man kann natürlich auch massiv Geld ins Militär pumpen, Drogen legalisieren und alle anderen Parteien verbieten.
Juckt die Bevölkerung aber eher weniger.

ABER: Smart gemacht, dass man die Zeit nicht beschleunigen kann, da verbringen sicher viele die ein oder andere Stunde zu viel in den Game (für nen Refund).

The only gameplay this game currently offers is moving sliders.

But even for a ""slider-moving simulator,"" this game wouldn't be any good, since even this simple function lags like crazy.

Sure, you could also pump massive amounts of money into the military, legalize drugs, and ban all other political parties.

But the population doesn't really care.

For an early alpha phase, it might almost be acceptable with a lot of goodwill.

BUT: It's clever that you can't speed up time; I'm sure many people will spend an extra hour or two in the game (for a refund).

I thought maybe there was some kind of gameplay hidden among all the sliders and lag.

2 - Отсутствие ускорения времени в игре
3 - Отсутствие выбора правящей партии 
4 - Отсутствие нормального контроля над производством политики и т.д  Видимо хотели упростить для людей.. но видимо не удалось, а так же всё выглядит как для мобильной игры.. плоский интерфейс и т.д 
5 - Отсутствие нормального контроля над войсками, а так же бывают баги что не закрывает показ вид войск и самолетов, имеется ввиду зоны передвижений и полетов.. лагучая херня которая со временем закрывается сама.
6 - Банальное отсутствие передачи контроля для ИИ как во второй части

(Чеченцы, Русские, Сибиряки если не ошибаюсь) Если они так хотели подробно создать геополитический симулятор где было бы указано все национальности в каждой стране и какой процент имеют.. то тут они облажались, а так же отдали Крым Украине.. куча минусов и игра выглядит как ранний доступ.. но даже ранний доступ не может быть на столько каловым.

Cons:

2 - No time acceleration in the game
3 - No choice of ruling party
4 - Lack of proper control over policymaking, etc. Apparently they wanted to make it easier for people... but apparently it didn't work. Plus, everything looks like it's made for a mobile game... flat interface, etc.
5 - Lack of proper control over troops, and there are also bugs that don't close the view of troops and aircraft, meaning movement and flight zones... a laggy mess that closes itself over time. 6 - The banal lack of control transfer for the AI ​​like in the second game.

There are still some downsides to the game that you only notice while playing... and I couldn't play for a long time, so I'm refunding my money. The same nationalism... As was said, there are 3 nationalities living in Russia... (Chechens, Russians, Siberians, if I'm not mistaken). If they really wanted to create a detailed geopolitical simulator where all the nationalities in each country would be listed and what percentage they represent... then they screwed up here, and also gave Crimea to Ukraine.

초등학생때부터 이런부류의 게임을 갈망한 어린 아이들이 거진 몇십년만에 이 게임을 다시 보게 되었습니다 저도 역시 그런 쪽이었고요. 

그리고 두근거리는 가슴을 두고 이 게임을 켜보더니 아름다운 UI이며 멋진 지구 그래픽이며 인류보다 두뇌가 더~~~좋은 AI들이며 이미 이 게임 자체가 클레멘타인에 버금가는 갓 작이라는걸 저는 깨닫고 이전 클레멘타인 이후로 얻은 감동을 또다시 여기서 두번째로 느끼고 있었습니다.

Children who have longed for this type of game since elementary school are finally seeing this game again after decades. I was one of those people, too.

And then, with a pounding heart, I opened it and realized the beautiful UI, the stunning Earth graphics, and the AI, which is even smarter than humans. This game itself is a godsend, on par with Clementine. I'm reliving the same excitement I felt after Clementine for the second time.

To everyone reading this review, I highly recommend buying this game. Superpower 3, a Clementine-level masterpiece that will take care of your nostalgia.

I'm not the only one feeling this grace and emotion. Let's feel it together.

I changed my mind after good ol sleep - it 100% has bugs and feels lacking in certain areas but the GUI I don't think is that bad - I think its better than superpower 2 GUI. 

War needs more work - units move way too slow and with no option to change the speed of the game it gets tiresome - just slow medium and fast mode would be nice - I know I can change the speed in the .ini files but I don't want to constantly go fast.

Should have released the sandbox mode with more config options - I ended up copying it and editing the code to give myself 100T :P that should have been possible from the game setup menu.

谷物的贴图都是马赛克，第一次捏人界面甚至直接把我搞闪退了
游戏没有引导系统，哪怕我玩过二代，拿到这个游戏也是不明所以，像是经济里投资发展货物用的是哪里的钱完全不清楚，投资之后也没有什么效果反馈，是盈余还是赤字全靠感觉
还有为什么把时间加速都删除了？为什么不能设计多档加速供玩家选择？
游戏的交互系统也十分糟糕，经济界面缺乏足够的折线图统计，GDP，失业率，货物盈亏增长，土地利用，完全没有统计图，反而重要性更低的政治界面还有稳定性和支持率的折线图，预算界面调整滑块还要一点一点地拖动鼠标，实际加个左右小箭头就方便左右微调了
外交系统也是完全的简化，二代有的国际组织全没了，哪怕说设计个特殊的联合国开会投票的系统或者安理会军事干预的机制都挺有意思的，现在的外交系统选项甚至比不上二代，能签的外交条款也是少之又少
只有政治系统让我多少有点眼前一亮的感觉，不同民族有不同的性格，支持率也分民众和媒体，甚至用了Hofstede的文化理论来描述一个国家的文化特征，非常有意思，但可惜也只限于此了
真的希望你们能像太吾绘卷或者无人深空一样，收到这样灾难性的反馈后能马上着手修改完善游戏，不然我就只能说好死了","Disappointing! Utterly disappointing!

The grain textures are all pixelated; the character creation screen even crashed my game the first time I played it.

The game lacks a tutorial system. Even though I played the second game, I was completely lost with this one. For example, I had no idea where the money for investing in goods came from, and there was no feedback on the effects of investments; whether there was a surplus or deficit was entirely based on guesswork.

Also, why did they remove time acceleration? Why couldn't they design multiple acceleration levels for players to choose from?

The game's interactive system is also terrible. The economic interface lacks sufficient line graph statistics; GDP, unemployment rate, goods profit and loss growth, and land use are completely devoid of statistical charts. Conversely, the less important political interface has line graphs for stability and approval ratings. Adjusting the budget slider requires dragging the mouse bit by bit; adding small left and right arrows would make fine-tuning much easier.

The diplomacy system is also completely simplified. All the international organizations present in the second game are gone. Even designing a special UN meeting and voting system or a Security Council military intervention mechanism would have been quite interesting. The current diplomacy options are even worse than in the second game, and the number of diplomatic treaties that can be signed is extremely limited.

Only the political system gave me a slight sense of novelty. Different ethnic groups have different personalities, and approval ratings are divided into public and media ratings. It even uses Hofstede's cultural theory to describe a country's cultural characteristics, which is very interesting, but unfortunately, that's about it.

I really hope you can, like with *The Scroll of Taiwu* or *No Man's Sky*, immediately start working on improving the game after receiving such disastrous feedback. Otherwise, I can only say thank goodness."

Kein ranführen an das Spiel, kein how to , kein Intro.
Spiele das Land und klicke dich durch alle Menüs und verstehe nicht worum es geht...

Größte Kritikpunkte bislang :

1. Komplett fehlende Einleitung. 
Die Menüs sind an sich ganz okay und übersichtlich, aber es fehlt in vielen Dingen die Tiefe. Das fängt schon damit an , dass man nicht versteht warum man sich beim handeln erst kompliziert durch jedes Land durchklicken muss, statt einer Liste mit potenziellen Handelspartnern. Export / Import klingt erstmal easy, aber es hat kaum bis nicht nachvollziehbare Einflüsse auf die Gesamtwirtschaft, 

2. Budgets.
Es steht per Mousover zwar dabei was für was sein soll, aber man merkt nichts davon. Man klickt sich munter durch und regelt hoch und runter bis man einigermaßen im Plus ist. Das hat mal mehr oder weniger Einfluss auf Stabilität und Zuspruch, aber man checkt einfach gar nicht was mit was zusammenhängt. Es wird nix erklärt. Man kommt sich total verlassen vor.

3. Menüs.
Komplett lieblos und keine Bindung für den Spieler. Man hat zu keinem Zeitpunkt das Gefühl man ist wirklich der Leader eines Landes. Es kommt gar kein Feeling auf. Nachrichten super klein und kaum erkennbar, der Rest der Welt still . Man bekommt eigentlich gar keine Hinweise oder Dialogfenster. Niemand spricht mit dir , anybody out there?! 

4. Trailer vs. Spiel.
Der Detaillierungsgrad ist 0,0 erreicht. Das Spiel zwingt dich in eine hässliche Auflösung und lässt dich dann in einer kalten Spielwelt mit kaum bis gar keinem Einfluss zurück und du stehst da so... ehm ja. Im Trailer werden Armeen gezeigt , Leute auf den Straßen, Städte erkennbar etc. All das sucht man vergebens. 

Fazit: Volle Abzocke. Das Spiel ist 0 Euro wert. Ganz ganz schlechte Fortsetzung. Schämt euch... echt Mal ...","Ugh, this is really bad... No introduction to the game, no how-to guide, no intro. You just play the country, click through all the menus, and don't understand what it's all about...

Biggest criticisms so far:

1. Completely lacking an introduction.

The menus themselves are okay and clear, but they lack depth in many areas. It starts with the fact that you don't understand why you have to click through each country in such a complicated way to trade, instead of having a list of potential trading partners. Export/import sounds easy at first, but it has little to no discernible impact on the overall economy.

2. Budgets.
While it's shown on mouseover what each item is for, you don't really get any sense of it. You just click around, adjusting things up and down until you're somewhat in the black. This has varying degrees of impact on stability and popularity, but you simply don't understand what's connected to what. Nothing is explained. You feel completely lost.


``` 3. Menus.

Completely uninspired and offers no connection to the player. At no point do you feel like you're truly the leader of a nation. There's absolutely no sense of immersion. Messages are tiny and barely legible, the rest of the world is silent. You don't get any hints or dialogue options. Nobody talks to you, anybody out there?!

4. Trailer vs. Game.

The level of detail is nonexistent. The game forces you into an ugly resolution and then leaves you in a cold game world with little to no control, and you're just standing there... well, yeah. The trailer shows armies, people on the streets, recognizable cities, etc. You'll search in vain for any of that.

Conclusion: A complete rip-off. The game isn't worth a single euro. A truly terrible sequel. Shame on you... seriously..."

요약
똥겜
5천원보다 비싸게 사면 병신","As a longtime Super Power 2 user and network administrator, I've been waiting for the game to be developed for over a decade.
But the actual game is so shoddy that it looks like it hasn't even been completed for a year or two. Even the simple UI is so cluttered and frustrating that it's impossible to understand. Even map changes and other controls are incomprehensible.
Furthermore, considering the high system requirements compared to the graphics, optimization seems far from perfect. In short, this game is a lousy, shiny mess.

After seeing the company's previous game, The Guild 3, I was skeptical, hoping it wouldn't be as bad as its predecessor. However, it ended up following the same path. Some companies hate releasing 3s, but this company is the only one that's going to fail if it does.

They say you should leave when the applause arrives, but this company has tarnished my memories by releasing a crappy game while I'm still applauding. I don't want to see it again.

Summary: A crappy game. If you buy it for more than 5,000 won, you're a retard."

123507558,german,2022.09.08 02:56,❌,❌,0.5224641562,3,"Ich kann das Spiel leider nicht empfehlen. Das Spiel ist mE schlechter als Super Power 2. Hätte man Super Power 2 remastered und ein paar der damaligen Bugs gefixt wäre mehr herausgekommen als bei diesem Spiel, dass sich wie ein EA anfühlt. Global-Strategiespiele-Fans sollten bei den etablierten Titeln von Paradox bleiben.  
Hier mal ein paar Punkte:
- trotz HighEnd PC läuft das Spiel nicht flüssig - (dürften wohl kaum mehr Rechenprozesse als bei EU IV geben, das läuft flüssig)
- wie schon in vielen Reviews geäußert, die Schieberegler im Budget bzw. Investmentsummen in einigen Wirtschaftszweigen sind undurchsichtig und bei den Reglern nicht empfindlich genug (wenn ich beispielsweise zum Ausgleichen des Haushalts ein Budget um nur 1 Mrd reduzieren will)
- viele Ideen des Wirtschaftssystems sind schlicht nicht zu Ende gedacht. Zwar kann ich sehen, wie groß mein Marktanteil am globalen Welthandel in den einzelnen Zweigen ist. Jedoch komme ich nirgendwo zu einer Übersicht des globalen Handels. Also wer hält Monopole? Wo lohnen sich Spionagemissionen zur Wirtschaftssabotage? Auch gibts keine Möglichkeiten Kartelle o.ä. wie etwa eine OPEC zu bilden.
- Die Haushaltsbilanz scheint verbuggt zu sein. So erwirtschafte ich laut Budgetübersicht über Jahre einen Überschuss im zweistelligen Milliarden Bereich. Gleichzeitig steigt aber weder mein investierbarer Kontostand in gleichem Maße, noch sinken meine Staatsschulden, sofern man voraussetzt, dass die Überschüsse zu 100% in die Tilgung von Schulden fließt (obwohl die Schuldentilgung schon ein fixer Punkt im Haushaltsbudget ist und dementsprechend die Überschüsse als tatsächlich verfügbares Guthaben zählen müssten)
- Die komplette Diplomatie ist einfach nur ramsch. Anders als in Super Power 2 gibt es keine deutlich sichtbaren Bündnisse wie NATO, Afrikanische Union oder Freihandelszonen als internationale Vertragswerke, denen man beitreten bzw. austreten (BREXIT) kann.
-Sobald es um militärische Konflikte dritter Staaten geht, wird angezeigt, dass es Konflikte um Regionen gibt. Die jeweiligen Staaten befinden sich dann jedoch bei anklicken deren Staatsansicht nicht miteinander im Krieg?! Auf der Weltkarte ist gleichzeitig schwer nachvollziehbar welche Regionen durch welchen Staaten besetzt gehalten werden usw. 
Auch hier war Super Power 2 deutlich besser!

FAZIT: Ein unfertiges Spiel, das so viel mehr könnte, wenn man es anständig entwickelt hätte bzw. einfach Super Power 2 als Basis genommen und etwas aufgewertet hätte. Wirklich schade. 
","Unfortunately, I can't recommend this game. In my opinion, it's worse than Super Power 2. If they had remastered Super Power 2 and fixed some of the bugs from back then, it would have been much better than this game, which feels like an Early Access title. Fans of global strategy games should stick to Paradox's established titles.

Here are a few points:

- Despite a high-end PC, the game doesn't run smoothly - (it probably doesn't use more processing power than EU IV, which runs smoothly)

- As many reviews have already mentioned, the sliders for budgets and investment amounts in some sectors are unclear and not sensitive enough (for example, if I want to reduce a budget by just 1 billion to balance the budget)

- Many aspects of the economic system are simply not fully thought through. While I can see my market share in global trade in each sector, I can't find an overview of global trade anywhere. Who holds monopolies? Where are espionage missions worthwhile for economic sabotage? There are also no options to form cartels or similar organizations like OPEC.

- The budget balance seems to be bugged. According to the budget overview, I've generated a surplus in the tens of billions for years. However, my investable account balance doesn't increase to the same extent, nor does my national debt decrease, assuming that 100% of the surpluses are used for debt repayment (even though debt repayment is already a fixed item in the budget, and therefore the surpluses should count as actual available funds).

- The entire diplomacy system is simply awful. Unlike in Super Power 2, there are no clearly visible alliances like NATO, the African Union, or free trade zones as international agreements that one can join or leave (Brexit).

- When it comes to military conflicts involving third-party states, it displays that there are conflicts over regions. However, when clicking on the respective states' state views, they are not at war with each other?! The world map makes it difficult to understand which regions are occupied by which countries, etc.

Super Power 2 was significantly better in this regard!

CONCLUSION: An unfinished game that could have been so much more if it had been properly developed, or if they had simply used Super Power 2 as a base and improved upon it. A real shame.

Студия не очень большая, выпустит игру в ""раннем доступе"", покажет уже какие нибудь наработанные механики, мы фанаты этой серии оценим и будем ждать дальнейших обновлений. Но это просто наглость со стороны разработчиков, дать нулевую игру по цене стоковой  Хойки например, при этом ни сделав ничерта!!! 

Как вообще в третьей части, с разницей в 17 лет от второй части, можно умудриться никак не развить аспект армии, а я бы даже сказал ухудшить, ибо тут какой то бред. Исследования есть у всех, быстро развиваются, модельки непонятные, сама боевка вообще нулевая, то есть в стратегии 2022 года боевка уровня 2004 года. При этом еще изуродовать главную вишенку серии СП2 - ядерная война. Насколько надо быть криворуким, чтобы в игре  начала нулевых ядерная перестрелка держав выглядела куда реалистичнее и захватывающее, чем в этой. 

Ладно армия, может хоть экономика изменилась? Та самая неработающая экономика второй части была исправлена? А вот не так. И по моему она не просто не исправлена, она зачем то упрощена и вновь работает по своим неведомым правилам. Менять ползунки и ставить налоги было прикольно в 2004 году, не уж то нельзя было развить данный аспект? Да и к тому же по сравнению с СП2 здесь нет Центрального банка, инфляции, куда банальнее показатели? (может конечно я пропустил). Про экономику нечего больше сказать, ее будто и нет в игре...хотя почему будто!

Вернемся к козырям игры, то есть к тому, чем так хвалились разработчики - демографией и политикой. Целое новое окошко добавлено было за 17 лет. Как нам обещали, что демография будет иметь сильное влияние, но на деле ничего! Есть какие то циферки, данные, но для чего? Они не несут никакой важной информации и на сам геймплей не влияют. Можно запрещать СМИ, свободы регулировать, но кому это нужно? Ведь это не меняет ничего! Ни революций, ни каких то гражданских войн нет, а значит смыслы от нового окошка нет.

Конечно уничтожить механики, которые нравились в СП и СП2 они смогли. Не говорю про банальщину, а именно, что даже блин тематические карты стали неудобными. Вот как можно облажаться с этим я не знаю, но они пробили дно и тут. Во первых карт стало меньше, где то шесть, во вторых  визуально они стали менее понятны. 

Их просили на протяжении всего периода разработки добавить крупные международные организации, подобие ООН. Вкладку ""Демография"" добавили, а хотя бы для вида организации по типу ""ООН"" нет. С соглашениями я вообще не разобрался, я так понял никаких НАТО фактически нет тут, типо союзники, но не НАТО. Дипломатия так же на нуле, она оттуда не вылазила. Они смогли сделать ИИ еще тупее спустя 17 лет. ПРОГРЕСС!! (нет)

Если говорить про политику, тот теперь даже партию менять нельзя, а вот создать кривого персонажа можно. По соображениям разработчика, персонаж и демография должны быть взаимосвязаны, по итогу все эти механики пустышки и делать с ними нечего. 

Итог: сэкономьте на обеде, эти разработчики не заслужили ни одной вашей копейки, раз такое наплевательское отношение к игрокам. Может быть великие мододелы исправят своим кропотливым трудом это, что вряд ли, ибо прикасаться к этому даже не хочется! Да, как ни странно, но СП2 лучше СП3 в любом аспекте. И лучше вновь запустить старую вашу сохраненку СП2,  чем тратиться на это!","I wasn't surprised by the game's raw, unfinished, and essentially empty nature. I was mentally prepared for this. The studio isn't very large; they'll release the game in Early Access, show off some established mechanics, and we, fans of the series, will appreciate it and wait for further updates. But it's sheer impudence on the developers' part to release a zero-quality game at the price of a stock Hokkaido, for example, without having accomplished a single thing!!!

How could the third game, 17 years removed from the second, manage to underdevelop the military aspect, or even worsen it, because it's just nonsense. Everyone has research, it's developing quickly, the models are incomprehensible, and the combat itself is completely useless—meaning a strategy game from 2022 has combat from 2004. And on top of that, they've ruined the highlight of the SP2 series—nuclear war. How clumsy do you have to be to make a nuclear firefight between powers in a game from the early 2000s look more realistic and exciting than in this one?

Okay, the army, but maybe the economy has changed? Was that dysfunctional economy from the second game fixed? Not really. And in my opinion, not only hasn't it been fixed, it's been simplified and once again operates according to its own unknown rules. Changing sliders and setting taxes was fun in 2004, so couldn't they have developed this aspect? And besides, compared to SP2, there's no Central Bank, no inflation, and far more banal indicators? (Maybe I missed something, of course.) There's nothing more to say about the economy; it's as if it doesn't even exist in the game... although why as if!

Let's return to the game's trump cards, that is, what the developers boasted about so much – demographics and politics. A whole new window has been added over the past 17 years. We were promised that demographics would have a strong influence, but in reality, nothing! There are some numbers and data, but what's the point? They don't convey any important information and don't affect gameplay. You can ban media and regulate freedoms, but who needs that? It doesn't change anything! There are no revolutions or civil wars, so the new window is pointless.

Of course, they managed to destroy the mechanics that people liked in SP and SP2. I'm not talking about trivialities, namely, that even thematic maps have become inconvenient. I don't know how they could screw this up, but they've hit rock bottom here too. Firstly, there are fewer maps, about six, and secondly, they've become less visually understandable.

They were asked throughout development to add major international organizations, like the UN. They added a ""Demographics"" tab, but there's no such thing as a UN-type organization. I haven't figured out the agreements at all; as far as I understand, there's no NATO here, just allies, not NATO. Diplomacy is also at a standstill; it's never been improved. They managed to make the AI ​​even dumber after 17 years. PROGRESS!! (no)

Speaking of politics, you can't even change your party now, but you can create a crappy character. The developers insist that character and demographics are interconnected, so all these mechanics are useless and pointless.

Bottom line: save yourself some money; these developers don't deserve a single penny from you, with such a disregard for players. Maybe great modders will fix this with their painstaking work, but that's unlikely, because I don't even want to touch it! Yes, oddly enough, SP2 is better than SP3 in every way. And it's better to reload your old SP2 save than waste money on this!"

Ну да ладно, это одна из самых не значительных проблем данной игры.  Основная проблема данной игры, то как она себя позиционирует, а позиционирует она себя как (гео)политический симулятор. Однако от политического симулятора тут совершенно ничего нет, кроме красиво-нарисованных таблиц. Это скорее варгеем, где твоя цель силовым путем захватить как можно больше территорий. 
 Можно задаться вопросом, чего не хватает в игре, чтобы быть геополитическим симулятором? Ответ прост: примерно всего. По сути тут полностью отсутствуют механики, хоть какой-либо, дипломатии, экономики и регулирования внутренней политики. Да, ты можешь играя за страну 3го мира заключить союзнические отношения с США или РФ, но никаких особенно последствий не будет, точно также как ты можешь запретить и аборты в своей стране особенных последствий также не будет, в принципе это касается всего, ты можешь творить все что захочешь, вернее, то, что тебе дает игра, а это не очень большой список, но последствий не будет. И это касается абсолютно каждого аспекта игры. Возьмем основного конкурента этой игры на данный момент - это Power&Revolution, да, это игра тоже очень недоделанная и с большим количеством багов, НО там есть хоть какие то механики дипломатии, вроде того же ООН и НАТО, и вступление в то же НАТО или объявления кому-либо войны , так или иначе, повлияет на ландшафт игрового мира и последствия ваших действий не заставят себя ждать. Экономика там, тоже не самая лучшая и со своими приколами, но намного более проработанная, и повышение или понижение налога значительно повлияет на государство. 
Самое неприятное на данный момент, это отсутствие ответа на вопрос чего ждать от игры? Она останется такой же не доработанной и просто умрет? Или это все таки такой ранний доступ без его пометки и в игру добавят необходимые механики? Для себя на данный момент я отвечаю на этот вопрос следующем образом - она умрет. Я не думаю, что туда добавят необходимые механики, потому что для этого нужно создать по сути новую игру. Но даже если я ошибаюсь, то с уверенностью могу сказать, что она не оживет раньше чем через год, потому что объем работы, который необходимо проделать, очень велик. 
Техническая часть: с багами я не сталкивался, но возможно я не понял, что  что то не работает.

Well, that's one of the game's most insignificant problems. The game's main problem is how it positions itself: it positions itself as a (geo)political simulator. However, there's absolutely nothing political about it, other than beautifully drawn tables. It's more of a wargame, where your goal is to seize as much territory as possible by force.

One might ask, what's missing from the game to be a geopolitical simulator? The answer is simple: pretty much everything. Essentially, it completely lacks any mechanics whatsoever: diplomacy, economics, and domestic policy regulation. Yes, playing as a third-world country, you can forge an alliance with the US or Russia, but there won't be any significant consequences. Just as you can ban abortion in your own country, there won't be any significant consequences. This applies to everything, basically. You can do whatever you want, or rather, whatever the game allows you to do, and it's not a very long list, but there won't be any consequences. And this applies to absolutely every aspect of the game. Let's take this game's main competitor at the moment, Power & Revolution. Yes, it's also very unfinished and has a lot of bugs, BUT it does have some diplomacy mechanics, like the UN and NATO. Joining NATO or declaring war on someone will, one way or another, affect the game landscape, and the consequences of your actions will be immediate. The economy, while not the best and with its quirks, is much more sophisticated, and raising or lowering taxes will significantly impact the state.
The most frustrating thing at the moment is the lack of an answer to the question of what to expect from the game. Will it remain unfinished and simply die? Or is this still early access without the early access tag, and will they add the necessary mechanics? My current answer to this question is this: it will die. I don't think they'll add the necessary mechanics, because that would require essentially creating a new game. But even if I'm wrong, I can confidently say it won't be revived for at least a year, because the amount of work that needs to be done is so enormous.

Technical: I haven't encountered any bugs, but perhaps I didn't realize something wasn't working.

Bottom line: the game isn't finished, there are no consequences for your actions, and I don't recommend buying it as a GEOPOLITICAL simulator.

Well, it's definitely dead."

Öncelikle Oyun bence daha bitmemiş, en az bir oyun boyutu kadar daha güncelleme gerekiyor. 
Önerilerim:
1-) Zamanı hızlandırma-yavaşlatma gibi fonksiyonların olması gerekiyor
2-)Ülke yönetmek bu değil. Bu ülkenin bir meclisi vs yok mu? Politika üretmenize oyun izin vermiyor. Gösteri kanunu, ifade özgürlüğü vs birkaç tane şey koymakla bu iş olmuyor. 
3-) Demokratik Kitle Örgütleri(Dernek, Sendikalar, Fraksiyonlar) yok, diğer partiler yok.
4-) Avrupa birliği, nato vb uluslararası örgütler yok. Aihm BM gibi kurumlar da yok.
5-) Uzay programları, altyapı çalışmaları işlenmesi gerekiyor.
6-) Bakanlıklar yok. Yaptım oldu mantığıyla olmaz bu iş. Örneğin insanların geçirilmek istediğim yasalara karşı kısmen direnci olmalı.
7-) Ülke yönetmek siyasi bir şeydir, abi oyunda siyaset yok. Sağ merkezli bir partinin kültürel harcamalarıyla sol merkezli bir partinin kültüre bakışı ve harcamaları aynı olamaz. Siyasi görüşlerin alınan her karara yansıması gerekir.",

Aucune profondeur de gameplay, UI basique, des images qui ne se chargent pas parfois et se rechargent par la suite dans ce qui est pourtant des interfaces très simples, des sliders qui lag...

Pour donner un exemple j'ai modifié mon budget d'économie en l'augmentant, et après un mois le taux de chômage est passé de 13% à 50%! L'explication est que lorsqu'on augmente le niveau d'éducation, les citoyens sont sur-éduqués, je comprends, mais en un seul mois? Impossible. Mon pays était alors en récession juste à cause de ça.

Même pour ceux qui préfèrent l'aspect militaire je ne vois pas l'intérêt de ce jeu... En espérant qu'ils s'améliorent avec des MAJ gratuites version NMS, mais dans l'état actuel c'est très décevant.","It's sad. I thought the reviews were exaggerated, but this release was really rushed, and it shows. There's no depth to the gameplay, the UI is basic, images sometimes fail to load and then reload in what are supposed to be very simple interfaces, and the sliders lag...

To give you an example, I increased my savings budget, and after a month the unemployment rate jumped from 13% to 50%! The explanation is that when you increase the education level, citizens become over-educated, which I understand, but in just one month? Impossible. My country was in recession because of that.

Even for those who prefer the military aspect, I don't see the point of this game... Hopefully, they'll improve with free updates like in New Machines, but in its current state, it's very disappointing."

it just feel a bit like a thin cup of tea and i dont want to risk not being able to refund it.
Yes the graphics is nice. Yes you can level up your military gear and so on, but it just feel like superpower 2
with a little better graphics but not really with many new features that i would expect.

Well as a test i play as denmark and declared germany war, and instant norway attack me but germany did nothing.
hmmmm i had expected another response. To be fair i like to say it was a very fast test that took 2 minutes and i did not experience how the game behave  and how your economy changes and diplomacy ect.
I did like the UI interface and how you easy can see what nations like you and such information.
The war that i see was just a box with statistics of how many troops you have and i click it to see more but nothing happen.
Well what i see just a weak slim experience.
I did not yet see the buildings on the map like you do in the videos or my troops in 3d, i just see some small icons on the map and i dont know why, but i could see my armys and move the around and research and make a new tank.. But it just feelt kind of weak somehow.
I dont know if the reason could be that i started a new game before the new patch was released.
During character creation i was not able to choose my own political party so you play as the most populare party ( currently in power ). From a game design point of view this is the easy way to make a game since the largest party give the player a good foundation to start from and if you could choose a less populare party it would be uphill and no gurantee that the player did not loose the next election.
Honestly maybe it would be better to not use real life partys OR at least let everyparty start out equal so the player could choose what he she want and then from there shape their nation. In general politics and religion is always a hard thing in games since the players are different and have different believes and values.

The positive things is the graphics, the big world and the user interface is easy to use.
But it just feel a bit slim and to simple for my liking.
There for i ask for a refund and honestly i dont think i will buy it again not even on sale
i will go play supreme ruler instead.

PS. several of the reviews of this game is wrong.
Yes you can play singleplayer.
Yes you can design units/tanks ect.. you just have to research the units first and after a few times you have researched something it will unlock the ability to assign ""skill points"" for a new unit.

So having waited 17 years for SuperPower 3 I had high hopes for this game. However SuperPower 3 is a real, real let down... I dont know where to start... 

1) It looks like a game (if you can call it a game) which was put together in a complete rush with not much time or energy invested into it.
2) The game is extremely boring, there is literally nothing to do. Once you set your budget sliders (which are also awful as they are clunky) theres not much else to do but sit.
3) There is only 1 set game speed and its super slow.
4) You cant even zoom in to the ground as show in their videos, the camera stops zooming in at a certain point.
5) You cant tilt the camera.
6) The military is full of bugs.
7) There are hardly any internal laws you can effect.
There are so many more things I can say but I would be here all night trying to list them...

This game should not have been released in its current state, even if it was an Alpha testing game I would say it would be too soon, never mind actually releasing the game...

I have tried so hard to love this game but I just cant, ITS BORINGGGGG!

The sad thing is, the developers didnt actually need to make drastic changes to SP2, they could have just tweaked it added in a few more features and sorted the bugs out, called it SP3 and I would have loved it. But what they have mashed together here is just awful...
Best thing the developers could do now is close the game, refund eveyone and just go back to SP2 and focus on releasing a DLC or something for that... We dont need better graphics we need better gameplay. SP2 graphics were perfect.

Perhaps the developers will engage more with us fans of SP2 before they make a SP4 in 20 years time...

The UI can use some work but there's nothing from my perspective thats game breaking, my only complaint is the price tag, this is at most a 15-20$ game, not a 30$ game. 

My background: I generally play alot of Paradox strategy games, and my only experience in this specific sub-genre is Supreme Ruler and the Democracy franchise.

1. We need an actual treaty system. Nations should not start off in all single alliances. NATO members arent in an organizational treaty, instead they are all in single treaty alliances say as USA you cant leave NATO you HAVE to end treaty with every single nation instead of leaving the organization. They NEED to add or incorporate the treaties system from SP2 so say as china if i wanted to make the shanghai pact i could create a organization treaty and have multiple nations invited and join at once and i could add others, they could try to join, or they could leave at will. 

2. Performance and UI needs slight work it can stutter and be kind of laggy but im sure this is an easy fix the sliders just need slight work as well

3. ICBM system needs work only being able to launch 33 at a time feels like a limitation and also the pathing needs work they should not only go from east to west or west to east they should take the shortest route possible to the target and you should be able to launch from multiple sources at once

4. You should be able to choose your party at start and ban parties as well

5. AI needs some work they can be very passive

6. Certain contested and occupied regions need to be added in northern cyprus, kashmir, a few more 

7. Military information needs a slight rework and maybe add experience for nations like the UK that have small but highly trained militaries 

8. You should be able to see your avatar a lot more in the treaty system maybe have you and your leader standing there like in the civ games

9. If possible add new models for military equipment and tech

EDIT: For the last major recommendations id like to have a speed timer x1 x2 x3 etc, anti ICBM research, and unit type rework, include drones especially since they are essential to modern and near future warfare.","Im putting a positive just because ive had contact with one of the devs and he has been very pleasant and reassuring about the game.

It's a game in pure alpha.

- You can't speed up time.
- They could make a better interface.
- You can't modify GDP by sector (only by investing in that sector).
- Poor combat system.
- The graphical effects of the ""nukes"" seem to be similar in power to Goku in mastered Ultra Instinct (it literally looks like the Earth is going to cease to exist xD).
- Poorly textured map.
- Apparently, January starts with 0 instead of 1.

- Hübsche Grafik der Welt
- Umfangreiche Bevölkerungsmerkmale (Ethnie, Religion, Eigenschaften von Bevölkerungsgruppen etc.)

I once invested $1,000,000 in grain. What happens to it? What's the point? Eritrea is starving. I wanted to export $10,000,000 worth of meat (why not euros, actually?) – it was rejected as ""not needed.""

On top of that, there are some bugs (dollars instead of euros, graphics aren't displayed correctly) and frame drops when I try to adjust the sliders in the economic sector. Fine-tuning is impossible.

The game can't be sped up; it's either pause or it's running.

But I also noticed a few positive things:

- Clear GUI
- Grouped sectors, no micromanagement
- Comprehensive tooltips for almost every display
- Attractive world graphics
- Extensive population characteristics (Ethnicity, religion, characteristics of population groups, etc.)

- My created player character influences politics and public perception.

Nevertheless: At this point, it's a complete flop! For me, ""Power & Revolution"" remains the industry benchmark.

Refund & Uninstall."

Похоже это всё на бетту, но никак не на релиз. Интерфейс настолько мудрёный, что хрен пойми куда и как. Боевая система- просто ужас, политическая система- кромешная тьма, выбор действий минимальнее некуда. Экономическая система- без ящика пива хрен разберёшься. Внутриполитические процессы- я вообще не понял как проходят, я просто выиграл выборы ничего не делая, накручивая налоги. Скорость игры великовата, ну за 2 часа-6 лет, ну чот слишком быстро. Как по человечески торговать- вообще не понятно. Доходы\расходы гос-ва тоже криво расписаны. Карта мира- это вообще отдельный вид издевательства...

 Ах ну и да, графика игры не вызывает восторга, а видеокарта(3060) греется до 70-75 градусов(это пока рекорд в играх у меня), ну каммон, она что, в космос собралась что ли?? Такое ощущение, что установили мне майнер за мои же деньги))

Единственный интересный плюсик- это во время войны аннексия тех или иных регионов, вот это сделано удобно. 
В общем тут можно поставить 3\10, не более. Главный конкурент этой игры(думаю все и так знаю какой), даже при наличии кучи багов- в разы интереснее и удачнее.","No, this is a disaster. My first impression is that my eyes are dazzled by the sheer number of indicators. Is this some kind of Excel simulator?

It all looks like a beta, not a release. The interface is so complex that it's impossible to figure out where or how to move. The combat system is simply awful, the political system is pitch black, the choice of actions is incredibly minimal. The economic system—you can't figure it out without a case of beer. I don't even understand how the internal political processes work; I just won the election without doing anything, jacking up taxes. The game speed is a bit too slow: 6 years in 2 hours—well, that's a bit too fast. How to trade properly is completely unclear. The government's income and expenses are also poorly laid out. The world map is a whole other level of mockery...

Oh, and yes, the game's graphics are underwhelming, and the graphics card (3060) heats up to 70-75 degrees (that's the highest I've ever seen in a game). Come on, is it going to outer space or something? It feels like they installed a miner on me, using my own money.

The only interesting positive is the annexation of certain regions during the war; that's a neat touch.

Overall, I'd give it a 3/10, no more. This game's main competitor (I think everyone already knows which one), even with its ton of bugs, is much more interesting and successful."

Специально перед выходом третьей части поиграл во вторую, теперь пишу обзор и меня натурально пробивает на хахаха... Что это за дичь, в которую я только что поиграл? Уже на моменте просмотра трейлера у меня закрались некоторые сомнения, но на деле всё оказалось ещё хуже:
- Графика. Даунгрейд, игра теперь выглядит как [spoiler]нечто[/spoiler] под мобильные устройства. Неиронично, вторая часть с модом Our Blue Marble выглядит, да и чувствуется в плане управления, на порядок лучше.
- Тематические карты. Нужно было постараться испортить то, что [b]уже было[/b], и у разработчиков получилось. Плавный переход цветов красный - желтый - зеленый или синий - красный в зависимости от негативности/насыщенности показателя? Теперь [spoiler]как минимум у режима, показывающего отношение к твоей стране[/spoiler] это крайне информативный переход от [strike]говна[/strike] коричневого к [strike]моче[/strike] жёлтому. Не говоря уже о том, что теперь по умолчанию режим карты сбрасывается по нажатию куда-либо. Может, я за недолгое время игры не разобрался, как заставить его держаться, а может быть это [b]фича)[/b]
- П[b]э[/b]рфоманс на высочайшем уровне. Может быть господа разработчики это ещё пофиксят (я на это действительно надеюсь), но на данный момент в игре присутствуют как рандомные лаги по ходу геймплея, так и задержки по полсекунды при движении ползунков, масштабировании, нажатиях и т.д. 
- Создание персонажа. Н**уя, а главное - зачем? Выглядит сейчас это разве что забавно - челикса в редакторе создать. [spoiler]не[/spoiler] Молчу о том, что часто пресловутый челик выглядит как персонаж из игры 10-х годов...  Зачем это в игре - непонятно. 
- Ядерные удары и как они выглядят. Вот это действительно смотрится как издевательство... Ну у вас же был пример, как это можно сделать, в вашей же игре. Во второй части несмотря на всю простоту челюсть отпадала при виде ядерного обмена двух или более держав. Сотни ракет, медленно движущихся в своей цели, взрывы от которых медленно покрывали всю страну. Каждому городу, мало-мальскому представляющему интерес, доставалось, и выглядело это довольно адекватно в масштабах планеты. Сейчас... ограничение 25 ракет на удар? 3д модельки размером с несколько стадионов, взмывающие вверх и пикирующие обратно? Взрывы, напоминающие масштабами взрыв Царь-бомбы, от которых экран трясётся секунд 10? Мне эта клоунада напомнила First Strike, но там хотя бы это изначально фишка в рамках стиля.
- Неинтуитивность интерфейса и в принципе дизайн. Минимализм и информативность сменились мультяшностью и излишеством. Кнопки снизу на треть экрана, тематические меню (политика армия и т.д.) теперь открываются на весь экран. Детализация второй части, где видны даже мелкие города и дороги? Здесь этого нет.
- Невозможность ускорять или замедлять ход времени. Только пауза/её снятие. Очень надеюсь на фикс.
- Округление показателей. Если у меня прибыль 2T, это 2 триллиона, 1.5 или 2.49?   
- Военная система и всё что в ней связано. Такое же [spoiler]нечто[/spoiler], как и во второй части, только ещё хуже. Выделил юниты и хочешь отправить их куда-либо кликом мышки? Как бы не так, передвинь сначала мышку на соответствующую кнопку и нажми, и вот тогда тебе откроется возможность выбрать область. 3д модельки это вообще хахаха. Вторая часть тоже вариативностью не хвасталась, но там был хоть какой-то реализм. Катюша, блин, в качестве реактивной артиллерии? Танчик времен ВМВ в качестве танка? Кто-то в своём обзоре ещё жаловался на производство юнитов, но я до него, признаться не дошёл [spoiler]и слава Богу, наверное[/spoiler]. Чрезвычайно медленному технологическому прогрессу из второй части пришёл на смену необычайно быстрый прогресс, когда за пару лет получаешь целый набор новых открытых технологий для юнитов.  
И это лишь верхушка айсберга, то, что я заметил за 50 минут игры...
Несомненно, что-то из этого разработчики пофиксят. Несомненно, есть и плюсы, например, шаги к улучшению боёвки [spoiler]хотя бы вместо одного большого замеса из второй части ввели борьбу за регионы и подобие микроконтроля[/spoiler]. Радуют и новые показатели для населения, радует возможность посмотреть главных импортёров твоих товаров по категориям. Миленько, что сценариев теперь больше и можно в них выбрать сторону конфликта. Явно есть и что-то ещё, что я не успел обнаружить за 50 минут. Что-то пофиксят моды. Не хочется сразу хоронить игру, но на данный момент минусы с лихвой перевешивают плюсы, и ничего кроме как ""не рекомендую"" про эту игру я сказать не могу. Особенно за 25 долларов, которые хотят за неё разработчики.","I can't recommend the game at the moment; I'm refunding my money. I played the second game specifically before the third one came out, and now I'm writing a review, and I'm literally going crazy... What the hell is this I just played? I had some doubts even while watching the trailer, but in reality, it turned out to be even worse:
- Graphics. The downgrade makes the game look like [spoiler]something[/spoiler] for mobile devices. Unironically, the second game with the Our Blue Marble mod looks, and even feels, much better in terms of controls.
- Thematic maps. They had to try to ruin what [b]already existed[/b], and the developers succeeded. A smooth color transition from red to yellow to green or blue to red, depending on the negativity/saturation of the indicator? Now [spoiler]at least the mode showing attitude towards your country[/spoiler] has a very informative transition from [strike]shit[/strike] brown to [strike]piss[/strike] yellow. Not to mention that the map mode is now reset by default by clicking anywhere. Maybe I haven't figured out how to make it stay on after playing for a short time, or maybe it's a [b]feature)[/b]
- P[b]e[/b]rformance is top-notch. Maybe the developers will fix this (I really hope so), but at the moment the game has random lags during gameplay, as well as half-second delays when moving sliders, zooming, clicking, etc. 
- Character creation. F**k, and most importantly - why? Right now, it only looks funny - creating a character in the editor. [spoiler]not[/spoiler] Not to mention that the notorious guy often looks like a character from a 1910s game... Why this is in the game is unclear.
- Nuclear strikes and what they look like. That really does look like a mockery... Well, you had an example of how this could be done, in your own game. In the second game, despite all the simplicity, my jaw dropped at the sight of a nuclear exchange between two or more powers. Hundreds of missiles slowly moving towards their target, the explosions from which slowly covered the entire country. Every city of even the slightest interest got hit, and it looked quite reasonable on a global scale. Now... a limit of 25 missiles per strike? 3D models the size of several stadiums, soaring upward and diving back down? Explosions reminiscent of the Tsar Bomba, making the screen shake for 10 seconds? This clownery reminded me of First Strike, but at least there it was a feature from the start, within the style.
- The interface and overall design are unintuitive. Minimalism and information have been replaced by cartoonishness and excess. Buttons are at the bottom of the screen, occupying a third of the screen; thematic menus (politics, army, etc.) now open full-screen. The detail of the second game, where even small towns and roads are visible? That's not here.
- The inability to speed up or slow down time. Only pause/unpause. I really hope it's fixed.
- Rounding of indicators. If my profit is 2T, is that 2 trillion, 1.5, or 2.49?
- The military system and everything related to it. The same [spoiler]something[/spoiler] as in the second game, only worse. Select units and want to send them somewhere with a mouse click? No way, first move the mouse to the corresponding button and click, and then you'll be able to select an area. The 3D models are absolutely mind-blowing. The second game wasn't exactly a game of variety, but at least it had some realism. A Katyusha, for crying out loud, as rocket artillery? A WWII-era tank as a tank? Someone else in their review also complained about unit production, but I confess I didn't get to that [spoiler]and thank God, I guess[/spoiler]. The incredibly slow technological progress of the second game has been replaced by incredibly fast progress, where in just a couple of years you get a whole new set of unlocked unit technologies.

And that's just the tip of the iceberg, what I noticed in 50 minutes of play...
The developers will undoubtedly fix some of this. There are certainly some positives, such as the steps taken to improve combat [spoiler]at least instead of the single-player brawl from the second game, they've introduced a fight for regions and some semblance of microcontrol[/spoiler]. The new population stats are also encouraging, as is the ability to view your top importers by category. It's nice that there are now more scenarios and you can choose your side in the conflict. There's clearly more that I didn't manage to discover in 50 minutes. Mods will fix some of them. I don't want to condemn the game right away, but at this point, the cons far outweigh the pros, and I can't say anything about it other than ""I don't recommend it."" Especially for the $25 the developers are asking for it."

But it's terrible, literally unplayable. It's far from finished; it's full of bugs. The systems don't work. For example, in my playthrough, I raised taxes to 100%, declared war on the entire world... God, I even committed war crimes across half the globe! All this with the United States, supposedly a democracy... My government's public approval rating? 80% and rising. That's what I mean when I say the systems don't work.
Don't be fooled by the photos and videos; they look great. On launch day, it's literally a rip-off. I don't know who thought releasing this in its current state was even worthy of being called a video game. What a huge disappointment."

123501057,german,2022.09.08 00:00,❌,✅,0.5007923841,1,"Neubewertung nach 30h Spielzeit.

Ich weiß ehrlich gesagt nicht wo ich anfangen soll. Es ist noch schlimmer als ich zu Beginn dachte.
Das Wichtigste vorweg: Ich kann nicht mehr ruhig schlafen in dem Wissen das Spiel empfohlen zu haben, also ziehe ich die Empfehlung zumindest bis da ordentlich nachgebessert wurde zurück. (Immerhin gabs schon mal nen kleinen Patch - nicht das es was geholfen hätte - aber scheinbar wird noch was dran geschraubt.)

Fangen wir mit dem Interface an:
Ich empfinde die Fenster als zu groß. Das ganze wirkt unübersichtlich und man verliert den Blick auf die strategische Karte. Es kommt mir vor, als wäre das Spiel für ein Tablett entwickelt worden. Grausam. Der Vorgänger hatte kleine Fenster, die man rumschieben konnte und die man auch während Kampfhandlungen offen lassen konnte. Die Infos waren auf einen Blick sichtbar und fertig. Ja, man kann das Fenster einklappen, aber dann ist das Fenster quasi weg und nur der Rahmen bleibt zu sehen. Man kann nicht mehrere Fenster gleichzeitig geöffnet lassen. Das stört mich ungemein.

Forschung und Einheitendesign:
Ich erwähne das zusammen, da man in diesem Teil der Reihe keine Einheitendesigns wählen kann. Im Laufe des Spiels ist mir aufgefallen, dass das Design einer Einheit sich mit dem Fortschritt der Forschung automatisch ändert. Das nervt mich! Ich will selber bestimmen, wie eine Einheit aussieht, unabhängig von Ihren Kampfwerten. 
In diesem Zusammenhang muss auch das Fehlen der Spielbeschleunigung erwähnt werden. Liebe Entwickler, ich weiß was ihr damit erreichen wollt. Wir sollen möglichst lange beschäftigt werden, indem wir auf sich füllende Balken starren. Aber a) macht das keinen Spass und b) hab ich das Umgangen. Ich wähle Irland, mache Bündnisse mit 4 oder 5 großen Ländern, stelle mich gut mit der USA und kaufe von denen sämtliche Forschung (ja ich hätte auch die USA nehmen können, aber dann hätte ich die Entwicklung nicht beobachten können). Nach EWIGEM Geklicke (man kann nämlich immer nur ein einziges Forschungsdingens einzeln Handeln - für alle Waffengattungen und bis man auf dem Stand der USA ist vergeht ne Weile), sieht man wie sich die Designs ändern. Irgendwie macht das noch weniger Spass, als darauf zu warten, bis sich der Balken füllt. 
Ach und wenn wir schon dabei sind: Obwohl ein Zerstörer ein ""ö"" im Wort hat und das auch angezeigt wird, wird es durch ""??"" ersetzt, wenn ich die Einheit Köln-Klasse nenne... echt merkwürdig.

Warum kann ich eigentlich nur einen Bauauftrag für eine Einheit einstellen? Warum keine Bauschleife? Ich habe mir mal den Spass gegönnt und 50 sehr fortschrittliche Zerst??rer gebaut und dabei mal auf die Uhr geschaut. Grob zweieinhalb realtime Stunden hat das gedauert. 2,5h in denen ich mir einen Balken angeschaut habe, der sich langsam füllt. Während der Zeit passiert, wenn man nicht gerade iwo Krieg führt und damit beschäftigt ist die Einheiten zu steuern (dazu gleich mehr) nichts! Was zur Hölle soll das?

Einheitenbewegung:
Unpräzise, unübersichtlich, langsam und kontraintuitiv. Für ein Tablett auf dem ich mit meinem fetten Finger irgendwo auf der Map hintatsche mag das reichen aber mit einer Maus? Die Reaktion der Einheiten nimmt mit steigender Forschung zu aber trotzdem ist das eine Frechheit, wie die Einheiten sich steuern lassen. Teilweise bleiben auch Artefakte der Pfade sichtbar bis man neugeladen hat. Zusammenlegen von Einheiten ist richtig schlimm. Da tut sich minutenlang gar nichts und man denkt der Befehl kam gar nicht durch und man beginnt schon an der Funktion der Maus zu zweifeln.

Richtig witzig wird es wenn man ein Land annektieren will. Liebe Entwickler. wenn die gesamten militärischen Einheiten eines Landes vernichtet wurden und meine nicht, habe ich die militärische Kontrolle über das Land und nicht nur über die Region in der meine Einheiten stehen. Wenn man das schon so doof machen muss, dann doch bitte mit der Möglichkeit mit Rechtsklick auf meine Einheit und ""Gebiet besetzten"" drücken (wie bei SP2) anstatt das ich nun jedes Gebiet einzeln manuell besetzen muss (bei der eben erwähnten suboptimalen Steuerung ist das richtig spaßig) bevor ich die Annexion starten kann.

Politik oder so ähnlich:
Das Schiebereglerproblem wurde nun schon in etlichen Bewertungen erwähnt, also versuchen wir mal etwas mit mehr Tiefgang. Leider kann man über oberflächliche Dinge nichts tiefgreifendes erzählen. Auswirkungen von Einstellungen oder Geldinvestitionen (btw immer in Dollar egal welches Land) sind zumindest für mich nicht ersichtlich. Ich habe keinen Plan was da passiert und trotz vieler Tooltipps habe ich keine Ahnung was ich da mache und ob das wirklich was gebracht hat oder noch bringen wird oder nicht.

Ich habe mal Kuba annektiert und seit dem stieg meine Arbeitslosigkeit auf 100%, ergo keine Einnahmen mehr und nachdem ich Stunden benötigt habe die Schulden meines Landes abzubauen (weil auch wenn man das Geld hätte, kann man die Schulden nicht sofort tilgen sondern muss warten bis die sich nach und nach abbezahlt haben) mache ich wieder Schulden ohne Ende. Ich habe Null Ahnung, wie ich das auffangen soll. Auch Investitionen im 11-stelligen Bereich in die einzelnen Zweige scheinen nichts zu bringen oder man sieht es einfach nur nicht. Keine Ahnung was da los ist.

Warum bekomme ich eigentlich von meinen Verbündeten ca. alle 2 Minuten ein Handelsangebot, bei dem ich ohne Gegenleistung meinen gesamten Barbestand an die überweisen soll? Das nervt halt richtig. Super gut wirds wenn man das Spiel neulädt. Da hab ich dann etwa 30 solcher Anfragen. Mehrere von jedem meiner Verbündeten. Ganz toll!

Kampfsystem: 
Kein Plan welche Einheit da gegen welche Einheiten kämpft, geschweige denn welche zusammenarbeiten und sich eventuell gegenseitig stärken, nicht sicher wer, wann, wieviel Schaden macht und warum das Ganze in einem quadratischen Bereich stattfindet, welcher Gebietsgrenzen komplett ignoriert, sodass man teilweise Länder in den Konflikt reinzieht, die man eigentlich nicht reinziehen wollte, ist mir völlig schleierhaft. Kampfsystem unter aller Sau. Da sind mir die kleinen Wölkchen und diese lustig animierte Einheitengegenüberstellung aus SP2 lieber.

Übrigens klingt meine Graka (RTX 3080) bei dem Game wie ein Triebwerk im Nachbrenner. Warum? Da passiert schliesslich gar nichts. Keine Einheitenbewegungen seitens anderer Länder, miese Auflösung und wenig Details. Trotzdem klingt meine GraKa als hätte ich vier mal Elden Ring auf Ultra offen. wtf!

Ganz ehrlich: Ich hab nu nicht alles erwähnt, was mir komisch vorkam oder mich genervt hat, aber das Spiel hat trotz all dem viel Potenzial. Es gibt viele gute Elemente (Charakter erstellen, was Auswirkungen auf die Beliebtheit hat z.B.) die ich aus Platzgründen nicht alle erwähnen kann. Wenn da ordentlich nachgebessert wird, kann das noch ein guter dritter Teil der Reihe werden. Im aktuellen Zustand ist das eher ein Early Access. Lasst die Pfoten davon, bis das fertig wird.

PS. Habe die ersten 3 Teile der Bewertung (nach 2h, 3h und 6h Spielzeit) aus Platzgründen cutten müssen. Sorry dafür.

Nachtrag zum Nachtrag: Es gibt ein Game Manual! 

https://superpower.fandom.com/wiki/Game_Manual_SP3

Nicht das ich wirklich scharf drauf wäre das zu lesen, aber da echt viele Fragen offen sind, werd ich das wohl machen...

Bye","Re-evaluation after 30 hours of gameplay.

Honestly, I don't know where to begin. It's even worse than I initially thought.

First things first: I can no longer sleep soundly knowing I recommended this game, so I'm withdrawing my recommendation at least until it's significantly improved. (There was a small patch, at least—not that it helped much—but it seems they're still working on it.)

Let's start with the interface:

I find the windows too large. The whole thing feels cluttered, and you lose sight of the strategic map. It seems like the game was designed for a tablet. Awful. The predecessor had small windows that you could move around and leave open even during combat. The information was visible at a glance, and that was it. Yes, you can collapse the window, but then the window is practically gone, and only the frame remains visible. You can't have multiple windows open at the same time. This bothers me immensely.

Research and Unit Design:

I'm mentioning this together because you can't choose unit designs in this installment of the series. During the game, I noticed that a unit's design changes automatically as research progresses. This annoys me! I want to decide what a unit looks like myself, regardless of its combat stats.

In this context, the lack of game acceleration also needs to be mentioned. Dear developers, I know what you're trying to achieve. You want to keep us occupied as long as possible by having us stare at filling bars. But a) it's no fun, and b) I've found a workaround. I choose Ireland, form alliances with four or five major powers, cultivate good relations with the USA, and buy all their research (yes, I could have chosen the USA, but then I wouldn't have been able to observe the progress). After endless clicking (you can only trade one research item at a time – for all weapon types, and it takes a while to catch up with the USA), you can see the designs change. Somehow, this is even less fun than waiting for the progress bar to fill up.

Oh, and while we're on the subject: Even though a destroyer has an ""ö"" in its name, and that's displayed, it's replaced with ""?"" when I name the unit Cologne-class... really strange.

Why can I only set one construction order for a unit? Why isn't there a build loop? I decided to have some fun and built 50 very advanced destroyers and timed it. It took roughly two and a half real-time hours. Two and a half hours of watching a progress bar slowly fill up. During that time, unless you're actively fighting a war and busy controlling your units (more on that later), nothing happens! What the hell is going on?

Unit movement: Imprecise, confusing, slow, and counterintuitive. For a tablet where I'm just tapping around on the map with my fat finger, this might be sufficient, but with a mouse? The units' responsiveness improves with increasing research, but even so, the way they're controlled is an outrage. Sometimes, artifacts from the paths remain visible until you reload. Merging units is truly awful. Nothing happens for minutes, and you think the command never even registered, and you start to doubt the mouse's functionality.

It gets really ridiculous when you want to annex a country. Dear developers, if all of a country's military units have been destroyed, but mine haven't, then I have military control over the entire country, not just the region where my units are located. If you have to make it this stupid, then please include the option to right-click on my unit and select ""Occupy Territory"" (like in SP2), instead of having to manually occupy each territory individually (which is truly fun with the aforementioned suboptimal controls) before I can even begin the annexation.


Politics or something like that:

The slider issue has already been mentioned in numerous reviews, so let's try something with a bit more depth. Unfortunately, you can't really say anything profound about superficial things. The effects of settings or investments (always in dollars, regardless of the country) are, at least to me, invisible. I have no idea what's going on, and despite numerous tooltips, I have no clue what I'm doing or whether it's actually made any difference or will make any difference at all.

I once annexed Cuba, and since then, my unemployment has skyrocketed to 100%, meaning no income. After spending hours paying off my country's debt (because even if you had the money, you couldn't just pay off the debt immediately; you have to wait until it's gradually paid off), I'm racking up debt again without end. I have absolutely no idea how to cope. Even investments in the eleven-figure range in various sectors don't seem to be making any difference, or maybe I just can't see them. I have no idea what's going on.


I've spent hours trying to reduce my country's debt (because even if you had the money, you couldn't pay off the debt immediately; you have to wait until it's gradually paid off), and now I'm racking up debt again like crazy. I have no idea how to deal with this. Even investments in the eleven-figure range in various sectors don't seem to be having any effect, or maybe I just can't see them. I have no idea what's happening.
... Why do I get trade offers from my allies about every two minutes, asking me to transfer my entire cash balance to them for nothing? It's incredibly annoying. It gets even worse when I reload the game. Then I get about 30 of these requests. Several from each of my allies. Fantastic!

Combat system:

I have no idea which units are fighting which other units, let alone which ones are cooperating and potentially strengthening each other. I'm not sure who does how much damage, when, or why the whole thing takes place in a square area that completely ignores territorial boundaries, sometimes dragging countries into the conflict that I didn't intend to involve. It's all a complete mystery to me. The combat system is absolutely terrible. I much prefer the little clouds and the amusingly animated unit comparisons from SP2.

By the way, my graphics card (RTX 3080) sounds like a jet engine in afterburner while playing this game. Why? Because nothing's actually happening. No unit movement from other countries, terrible resolution, and a lack of detail. Despite all that, my graphics card sounds like I'm running Elden Ring four times on Ultra settings. WTF!

Honestly, I haven't mentioned everything that struck me as odd or annoying, but despite all that, the game has a lot of potential. There are many good elements (character creation, which affects popularity, for example) that I can't all mention due to space constraints. If they significantly improve these aspects, it could still become a good third installment in the series. In its current state, it's more like an Early Access title. Leave it alone until it's finished.

P.S. I had to cut the first three parts of the review (after 2, 3, and 6 hours of playtime) due to space limitations. Sorry about that.

Addendum to the addendum: There's a game manual!

Войны - ЧТО ЭТО ТАКОЕ? ВЫ ВООБЩЕ САМИ ИГРАЛИ В ЭТО?
Оптимизация - Её нет...
Всё урезали. Всё ушатали...

Я ждал от игры только то, что допилят и улучшат SuperPower 2, а в итоге они мало того, что недоделали игру, так ещё и урезали то, что было в SuperPower 2, а я напоминаю, что игра выходила в 2004 году и имела понятный интерфейс, приятную музыку, да даже война была куда интереснее, чем в SP3.

За час игры в SuperPower 3, я разочаровался, пока играл, я всё сильнее хотел уйти играть в SuperPower 2.

У вас же была основа SuperPower 2, почему её не взять и не допилить, а не изобретать велосипед, как вышло...

The politics are so bad I can't even choose a ruling party at the beginning;

Wars - WHAT IS THAT? HAVE YOU EVEN PLAYED THIS?
Optimization - There's none...
They've cut everything. They've ruined everything...

I was expecting only that they would polish and improve SuperPower 2, but in the end, not only did they unfinish the game, they also cut everything that was in SuperPower 2. And I remind you that the game was released in 2004 and had a clear interface, pleasant music, and even the war was much more interesting than in SP3.

After playing SuperPower 3 for an hour, I became disillusioned. As I played, I became increasingly tempted to play SuperPower 2.

You had the foundation of SuperPower 2, why not just take it and polish it instead of reinventing the wheel, as happened...

But this game is pretty bad. I know that a bunch of other people already gave this a bunch of awful reviews and that's because the game deserves it. This is my first entry into the SuperPower games and it was not a good one.

The game is broken in so many ways it's hard to list them all. It's missing in so much content that it feels empty or super Early Access.

Scroll up real quick, look at the advertisements for the game? See those? Don't they look cool? They're not in the game at all, and the game is NOTHING like the advertisements. It's basically like a boardgame without turns. Half the time your commands don't work, half the time nothing you do matters at all. I conquered Mexico and no one in the world cared. IT was a pointless, nonsensical invasion with no real reason and my approval rating actually went up by 3 percent and the rest of the world didn't notice or care.

The game wouldn't let me use nukes. When I scrolled in I only got a vague shadow picture of my troops and couldn't see cities at all. Apart from the cutscenes there are no sound effects and no other voice acting. The only thing you get is simple background music. THe game doesn't let you choose which political party you belong to. The game doesn't let you make a lot of choices and even then you're choices seemingly don't matter to anything. I was able to get america out of debt, increase my approval rating, and  completely take over another country and there were ZERO consequences for any of my reckless actions to get us that far. And...it only took a couple of clicks to completely improve my country in every way possible.

The game is missing so much, and it's so buggy that it's more annoying than fun to play. Pass on this one. Either pass on it completely, or come back in a year or two after some serious updates. If you're new to the series then just run away as fast as you can. This super complicated confusing game offers no tutorials and no teaching to help you learn how to play.

While the developers of that time (2003 - 04) are not longer with us in working towards the new SuperPower, I can't get the feeling of having that same level of game-play in SuperPower 3.

1. For starters, the game has stabilization issues on some windows PC's. Crashing and freezes during load-up is common, and unfortunate. It's hard to get into the game without having issues as mentioned above.

2. The game-play is really slow, like reaallly slow, and the absence of fast-forwarding time makes SP3 really boring right at the beginning, it's hard to get into tense moments without having to get up from your chair, or do something else while you wait. The fact that SP2 has a fast-forwarding option, while SP3 doesn't is confusing and frustrating.

3. Having a R7 5800x, and RX 6650 XT, theres no reason for SP3 to having FPS issues, the game will occasionally stutter from troop build-up on multiplayer, or battles that are near by, and the budget bar for whatever reason is unresponsive during multiplayer, performance is lacking.

4. The AI behaves very strangely in SP3, I don't know if its because of Server lag, but conquering or nuking nations you'll expect the AI to behave accordingly, but it doesn't, and thats the issue, the AI doesn't respond to these scenarios.

I don't know if SP3 will continued to be worked on or if the developers will try to fix the game, but at the current state, the game is a disappointing mess.","Superpower 2 was an extremely fun game to play, with the community and in-general, it was a game to enjoy and sit back to relax.

UI又简单又复杂，主界面的选项按钮藏在右上角，对新玩家很不友好。
捏脸系统比较鸡肋，唯一有用的是小人的语言和信仰对游戏难度有影响，当然女性角色捏脸的界面像没设计完，发型和衣服的预览图都是男性角色照搬过来的，只能一个一个试，很不方便查看！
游戏加载速度比较慢，进入游戏大概花了5分钟。可能是我开了最高的画质吧，但这画质也不是很高，放大缩小到一个点还会有明显卡顿。
游戏时间只有暂停和运行，游戏里的一天大概是5s。
进入游戏后也没有二代的教程，我这个老玩家都有些一头雾水，我知道有官方的视频，但是替代不了直接操作的教程。
查看地图类别也不方便，原先右键可以直接解决，现在要在右下角，一串密集的UI，很容易点错。图例也相当摆设，举个例子，查看国家关系地图，图例的颜色都是黄色，从浅黄到深一点的黄，辨别颜色能到美术生狂喜的程度，像二代有的关系数值也是不存在的，玩一局我觉得我能色弱。其他图例大体也都这毛病（只有核实力地图很直观清晰，原因大家都明白...）
各个面板内容新增的内容很少，和二代相比多了互联网控制，媒体控制，建立使馆，进口国家选择，机场，第一二产业等。但是！各个面板都删除了更多的东西，法律，宗教，语言，首都，政体，利率，贸易，进出口控制等等，可玩性减半。
以上是我游玩40分钟的发现，可能有疏漏。总之一句话，玩的很别扭，要不是2的老玩家肯定会退款。坐等下一次更新吧","I wouldn't recommend it at least for now; it's completely different from the second generation.

The UI is both simple and complex. The main menu options are hidden in the upper right corner, which is very unfriendly to new players.

The character creation system is rather useless. The only useful aspect is that the character's language and beliefs affect the game's difficulty. The female character creation interface seems unfinished; the hairstyle and clothing previews are copied from male characters, so you have to try them one by one, which is very inconvenient!

The game loads slowly; it took about 5 minutes to get into the game. This might be because I was using the highest graphics settings, but even those aren't very high quality. Zooming in and out to a specific point results in noticeable lag.

The game time is only paused and resumed; a day in the game is about 5 seconds.

There's no tutorial like in the second generation. Even as a veteran player, I was a bit confused. I know there are official videos, but they can't replace a direct tutorial.

Viewing map categories is also inconvenient. Previously, right-clicking was easy, but now you have to go to the lower right corner, where a dense UI makes it easy to click the wrong thing. The legends are also quite decorative. For example, when viewing the map of national relations, the legends are all yellow, ranging from light to darker shades. Distinguishing between colors would be a nightmare for art students. Some relationship values ​​from the second game are also missing. Playing one game, I think I'll become colorblind. Most other legends have the same problem (only the nuclear power map is clear and intuitive, for reasons everyone understands...). The various panels have very few new additions. Compared to the second game, there's internet control, media control, establishing embassies, choosing importing countries, airports, and primary and secondary industries. However! Many more things have been removed from each panel: laws, religion, language, capital city, political system, interest rates, trade, import/export controls, etc., halving the replayability.

These are my findings after 40 minutes of gameplay; there may be omissions. In short, it's very awkward to play. If I weren't a veteran of the second game, I would definitely request a refund. Waiting for the next update."

Rating: ★☆☆☆☆

Superpower 3, the latest offering from GolemLabs, sadly fails to rise above the disappointingly low expectations set by the developer's previous track record. Despite being the successor to a series with some potential, this game stumbles and falls, unable to reach the basic threshold of what constitutes an engaging gameplay experience.

The game feels woefully incomplete, more reminiscent of a student project or a pre-alpha build rather than a fully-fledged game ready for commercial release. It's like the skeleton of a game, with bare-bones mechanics and an unfortunate lack of fleshed-out content. The gameplay, or rather the lack of it, is startling, leaving players navigating through an empty shell that promises much but delivers little.

In retrospect, the absence of gameplay showcases in their promotional material makes more sense. There's simply not enough substance to the gameplay mechanics to create engaging and exciting moments for the players. What is presented is so minimalistic and underdeveloped that it gives an impression of an unfinished product that was prematurely rushed to the market.

GolemLabs, unfortunately, seems to have taken a significant step backwards with Superpower 3. Instead of building upon past experiences and rectifying issues from previous entries in the series, they seem to have regressed, delivering a game that is even less polished, immersive, and enjoyable than its predecessors.

In conclusion, Superpower 3 is a massive letdown. It feels incomplete, lacks engaging gameplay, and doesn't offer any semblance of the depth or complexity that one would expect from a game in this genre. Sadly, this game might very well be the final nail in the coffin for GolemLabs. Unless there's a significant overhaul and a multitude of improvements made post-release, it's hard to see any redemption for this title. A disappointing outcome for a game that had the potential to be so much more.","[b]Falling Far Short of Expectations[/b]

This game, whilst impressive in some regard visually, is very poor.

The map looks like a Paradox game with all the 3D buildings, a large deviation from the previous game which just used dots on the map, which I significantly dislike.

The controls are incredibly clunky, I couldn't even defeat Taiwan's military after nuking it with 16 ICBMs as China and fully occupying and annexing the country, what? Why are random helicopters and submarines still alive? Makes zero sense to me.

The UI is exaggerated and too large, SuperPower 2 was very quick and even dare I say simple compared to this, the layout is just too confusing here.

You can only build one unit design at once, China, which has one of the largest shipbuilding industries and largest steel industries in the world, can only build 10 destroyers (and nothing else, not tanks, not missiles, not infantry at the same time) at once.

There is no actual content, AI actions and decisions seem to be random, there's no event feed like in SP2 so you can't really tell what's going on.

Lots of world leaders are (no joke) just named John and Jane Doe, why do so many cultures lack names? This game was marketing itself on its character creation and demographics.

SuperPower 2 is significantly stronger gameplay wise and design wise than this hollow corporate money grab shell of a game.

I'm not developing mods for this, not until it gets significant patches.

- The whole cultural stuff (each culture has a bunch of affinities that make them like certain laws and ways of governing more or less) is pretty cool, I don't think any game tried anything similar before.

You can easily improve relations with other countries and get into an alliance with almost everyone and so far i have not seen any conflict in the game without starting it myself.
When Territorial.IO is a more realistic representation of the world than your management/wargame then you must have seriously dropped the ball.

I don't think there will be a sequel to The Guild 2 or Super Power 2, so I'll just relegate them to the distant past.

I don't think I'll ever buy another Golem Labs game again."

123498189,schinese,2022.09.07 22:50,❌,✅,0.5,1,"我是第一次接触这个系列的游戏，所以没有老玩家的那种期待，且我除了一个拖拽地球会出BUG以外暂时还没遇见卡顿，UI模型错误的问题。我觉得我应该给中评，这也仅仅想表示对其的一个较低价格（相比P社）的肯定和未来开发的鼓励。

但是很明显这个游戏目前来说就是个半成品，这点跟行业龙头P社学的很像。不仅仅是缺乏有效的新手引导，有些游戏的细节很显然说明制作方查证资料并不到位，比如中国的核力量，打击范围竟然连东亚都出不了，我看着那三个小圈圈就蚌埠住了；再就是经典的地图私货，台湾彻底是个国家了，藏南也不出意外成了印度的一个邦...

除了主权问题以外最大的问题就是，入门引导去哪了？谁来告诉我们怎么做？我作为一个刚入门这个系列的新玩家，就只能干巴巴地拔一下各种预算条条，开放一下什么集会权LGBT结婚认可，看一下国内支持度是增长还是减小，看看能不能敲诈一下小国家签条约...然后在各种机制不清晰（补一点，连倍速都没有）的情况下，我最终只能放弃打算就来评论区看看，结果就是一片“不值得”。

我对这个游戏的潜力还是很看好的，如果发行商和制作组能够像《地球不屈》一样与玩家及时沟通并快速做出一些补救措施的话，我还是会继续玩下去的，就怕开发商和制作组直接沉默跑路了。准备看看后续情况再决定改不改评测以及是否退款。

我怀疑今天就是25号的演练，到时V3怕是要把今天大家的愤怒给重演一遍。。。","This is my first time playing this series, so I didn't have the expectations of a veteran player. Aside from a bug where dragging the globe causes lag or UI model errors, I haven't encountered any issues yet. I think I should give it a neutral rating, simply to acknowledge its relatively low price (compared to Paradox Interactive) and encourage future development.

However, it's clear this game is currently an unfinished product, much like Paradox Interactive, which seems to have learned from industry leaders. It's not just the lack of an effective tutorial; some details clearly indicate the developers' inadequate research. For example, China's nuclear capabilities are depicted as having a strike range that doesn't even extend beyond East Asia—I felt like I was going to stay in Bengbu looking at those three small circles. Then there's the classic map bias: Taiwan is practically a country, and South Tibet is unsurprisingly an Indian state...

Besides the sovereignty issue, the biggest problem is: where is the tutorial? Who's going to tell us how to play? As a new player to this series, all I could do was mechanically adjust various budget constraints, explore things like granting assembly rights and LGBT marriage recognition, check domestic support for the game to increase or decrease, and see if I could pressure smaller countries into signing treaties... Given the lack of clarity in various mechanics (and even with some updates, there's no speed-up function), I ultimately gave up and came to the comments section, only to find a sea of ​​""not worth it.""

I still have high hopes for this game's potential. If the publisher and development team can communicate with players promptly and take remedial measures like they did with *Earth Unbreakable*, I'll continue playing. My only fear is that the developers and team will simply disappear without a trace. I'll wait and see how things develop before deciding whether to revise my review or request a refund.

* After concurring all the regions of a nation, they still exist and you are put in a permanent war with them in the diplomacy tab
* Every new year starts at 1/0/20XX
* Troops Randomly Appear and Disappear
* SEEMS FIXED - Troops sometime don't move
* FIXED - Many logos and icons are missing and are replaced with just a checker board
* You can only take one territory per treaty (meaning you have to make many separate treaties to conquer a nation)
* Even at low settings the game seems to lag (might be a hardware problem on my part)
* FIXED - The lack of speed controls is really annoying
* FIXED - The most units you can build at a time is only 10,000 which is basically nothing
* You can't tell your troops to occupy a country's territory (like in SP2)
* Trades in Pending Trades menu are missing text
* Thematic map reverts back to standard after clicking another nation
* SEEMS FIXED - Previous troop movement lines remain after troops finish moving
* KINDA FIXED - (Now they show your flag instead) Capital flags of conquered nations persist after their downfall
* Multiplayer is extremely laggy
* Investing the in economy causes GDP to decrease (might be intentional to show the lowering of profits, not sure)

* The new ""battle zone"" tactical maps

SuperPower 2 is better (even though you can't play in full screen and therefore can't see the whole game). There's only one musical theme that repeats every 10 seconds. There's only one game speed. You can't pause with the spacebar; everything has to be done with the mouse (in 2022, yes...).

Tecnicamente:

1. Ya nada empezar no he podido abrirlo, aunque reintentadolo lo he logrado, pero no es un buen comienzo.

2. No se ve en resoluciones altas, es decir el juego da la opción de ponerlo en 4K pero luego no lo muestra en pantalla.

3. Mal optimizado, lento, lag, bugs, etc...

En fin, de momento muy mal lanzado, como viene siendo  habitual por parte de la gran mayoría de las compañías desarrolladoras.

En lo personal:

Se queda muy corto en simulación política, a penas hay opciones en lo que a politica se refiere. En investigación militar está bien detallado, pero es tanta la diferencia entre una parte de la simulación y otra, que basicamente acaba siendo un juego para atacar otra  nación y poco más, así que si vas buscando un juego donde puedas tocar todos los palos de un gobierno, tan solo encontrarás militar y un poquito de industria, por lo demás es nulo.

Es una lastima porque estuve muy pendiente de este juego y le tenía ganas, pero o lo arreglan mucho o será otro fracaso.

saludos.","I can't recommend this game for several reasons:

Technically:

1. I couldn't even open it from the start, although I managed to get it working after trying again, but it's not a good start.

2. It doesn't display in high resolutions. The game gives you the option to set it to 4K, but then it doesn't show it on screen.

3. Poorly optimized, slow, laggy, buggy, etc.

In short, a very poor launch so far, as is typical for most development companies.

Personally:

It falls very short in political simulation; there are hardly any political options. Military research is well-detailed, but the difference between one part of the simulation and another is so great that it basically ends up being a game about attacking another nation and little else. So, if you're looking for a game where you can explore all aspects of government, you'll only find military and a little bit of industry; otherwise, it's nonexistent.

It's a shame because I was really looking forward to this game, but unless they fix it drastically, it'll be another flop.

As a tech demo, a pre- or early alpha, this would have shown a lot of potential. But as a finished game? No way. And I am not talking about No Man's Sky style lack of content - there is nothing resembling a serious gameplay loop here. I used to be a voluntary tester for other grand strategy games by another publisher, and let me tell you: their earliest test releases had a lot more going on than this released game.

I'll add a few issues I posted about in the community forum just to illustrate what kinds of issues I am talking about:

1. The world feels very passive. It doesn't seem like the AI is doing much or that there's even an AI at all. Someone else reported the AI not responding even to a nuclear attack, and I can confirm that.

2. That leads into the other major issue: information. The game does not give you any meaningful information about what's going on around the world, and if it does, it's just a very dry, small notification on the respective area of the screen. If you're used to Paradox titles where there's always something happening somewhere in the world and you can follow along, this is not doing a great job.

3. Add ot that lack of meaningful information about your own nation. The game tells you that unemployment is due to population groups preferring to work in industries that are underdeveloped, but it doesn't tell you *which* population groups or *which* industries. In general, you don't get a very good idea of what is going on in your country, making it really hard to make informed decisions.

This also affects diplomacy: Good luck finding out where the game shows you another country's opinion of yours, and good luck figuring out if another country is likely to accept your proposal or what your proposal even does. Diplomacy is *technically* there, but is not usable at all.

4. Finally, I've noticed there's a distinct lack of customization. Which is baffling, because they spent all the dev time on choosing a hat for my avatar, but I can't even name or choose my party? I can however name treaties and unit designs (a feature I don't think works reliably right now), but I'd rather be able to change information about my country such as its name or, getting really crazy here, flag.

5. Oh, and on another footnote: yes, there's only one game speed, no, pause is not bound to space, and most irritatingly, typing (e.g. when naming the aforementioned treaties) *triggers camera movement*, so the game doesn't even lock keyboard input to a text box when editing one.

There's no multi-speed mode, and it's ridiculously laggy.

Each page seems to have a lot of content, but it's actually more rudimentary than a browser game. If Super Power 2 was already rough, then Super Power 3 is a half-cut version of the second.

The character creation system could be completely removed. This part is entirely unnecessary for the game, and the character models are terrible. I thought it would be like Tropico where you create a character with strengths and weaknesses, but currently, you can't see your created character anywhere except on the character creation page. In other words, they've made a purely gimmicky feature while making the game itself a mess.

I've requested a refund. The overall content and playability are even worse than some casual games, like Sunrise.

I rarely find a game that makes me want to swear after less than an hour, but this one absolutely has to.

After entering the game, the few bars at the bottom of the UI are your main operation options. The world map doesn't have the interactive or provincial information pop-up when you click on another player's territory like in similar games. It just lights up briefly and then disappears.

All the interaction relies on those few bars at the bottom. Once you click them, the overall gameplay experience is like a garbage browser game, worse than that free Cold War political browser game made by the French, or that kind of ""simulation management"" browser game from 2008 in China.

Clicking on the military page just shows huge soldier models, laughable.

No tutorials, no guidance, just a jumbled mess of buttons, a few ""Off"" and ""On"" switches, and a budget bar.

It's truly laughable. THQ should just go back to the grave. They've published so many pieces of garbage in a row. Now, seeing THQ as a publisher makes me uneasy; it's likely to be another piece of garbage.

The graphics aren't better than the second game, the content is less, and the optimization is worse. I suggest renaming it ""Super Power 1.5""."

보통 가장 처음으로 접하게 될 버그가 해상도 버그일텐데..
옵션 - 설정에서 해상도 변경이 안될겁니다.

이건 우선.. 창모드로 바꾸면 해상도 변경란이 활성화 됩니다.
그 이후 해상도를 설정하고, 다시 전체화면으로 바꾸면 됩니다.

덤으로 제가 3080ti를 사용중인데 그래픽카드 팬이 미친듯이 돌아갑니다. 그래픽카드를 얼마나 갈구는 것인지... 다른 고사양 게임을 돌릴때도 이렇게 미친듯이 팬은 안돌아갔었습니다.
더군다나 최적화도 안되있는 듯 프레임도 제대로 안나오네요. 좀 끊김현상이 발생합니다.

창모드로만 해상도 조정이 가능한 똥겜. 거기다 튜토리얼 따위 역시 없습니다. 
기존 슈퍼파워2 즐기셨던 분들이라면 어느정도 즐기실 수 있겠지만 처음하시는 분들은 진입장벽이 좀 있으실 겁니다.

게임속도 조절? 그런거 없습니다.

UI는 한글화 되어있으며 번역 퀄리티는 훌륭하다고는 못하지만, 그럭저럭 괜찮은 느낌입니다.

아직은 버그도 많고 여러모로 부족한 게임입니다. 
현재 출시 특가로 10% 세일하는데, 찍먹한 제 느낌으로선 좀... 버그 수정 좀 이루어지고 나면 그때 가서야 할만한 게임이 될 것 같습니다.

한줄 요약 : 현재로선 전작인 슈퍼파워2보다 못한 게임.","This game still has many bugs and many shortcomings.
The first bug you'll encounter is usually the resolution bug.
You won't be able to change the resolution in Options - Settings.

First, switch to windowed mode to activate the resolution change option.
After that, set the resolution, and then switch back to full screen.

As a bonus, I'm using a 3080ti, and the graphics card fan is spinning like crazy. It's amazing how much the graphics card is demanding... Even when I played other high-spec games, the fan didn't spin like this.

Furthermore, it seems poorly optimized, with poor frame rates. There are some stuttering issues.

This is a crappy game that only allows resolution adjustment in windowed mode. There's also no tutorial.

Those who have played the original Super Power 2 will probably enjoy it to some extent, but beginners will find it a bit challenging.

There's no game speed control.

The UI is in Korean, and while the translation quality isn't perfect, it's still decent.

The game still has a lot of bugs and is lacking in many ways.

It's currently on a 10% launch sale, but in my humble opinion, it's a bit... I think it'll only become worth playing once some bug fixes are made.

Summary: Currently, it's worse than its predecessor, Superpower 2."

And overall this looks like an unfinished buggy mess. You can not create new unit designs in the form of actually designing the model of your units. The AI can also be unresponsive, I walked right into territory most of the time and the country I invaded just let me take their land. I have also seen very basic grammatical issues as well. (Not a grammar nazi but some of these are just plain bad.) 

I do not intend to find out what else is wrong with this game as I have seen enough in the rough 30 minutes I have played to figure out I will not enjoy this game and will regret buying it.

Když jsem se díval na trailery hry, pochopil jsem, že opravdu moc chci si zahrát tuto hru. To znělo jako dobrý a zajímavý strategický simulátor politiky. Ale co máme ve skutečnosti?

Samozřejmě, já doufám, že vývojářům ještě se podaří opravit hru a za pár týdnů nebo měsíců ještě jednou se podívám jestli ve hře něco se opraví. Ale stručně řečeno, to nemá cenu hrát tuto hru v dnešním stavu. Jo, určitě, můžete trochu zahrát a pak udělat refund, jestli hra se nebude vám líbit. No, doporučil bych vám jiný nápad: používat možnost refundu později, když už budou nové patchy a opravy.

První věc, kterou jsem si všiml, že tady nebyly žádné tutoriály. To asi už bude existovat v první dny po vydaní. Tady jsou spoustu sliderů, tlačítek a složek, ale dost málo užitečnou informaci o tom, jak to fungue. Ale vliv různých parametrů je divný a skoro vždycky žádný.. Například, když jsem hrál za Česko, tak jsem nastavil 100% daň z mezd a kromě toho, vůbec vynechal všechny možnosti pro rozvoj a stabilitu země z rozpočtu. To trvalo dva roky. A jak výsledek, podpora od občanů více, než 50% a pak jsem měl vyhrané volby.

No, ok, možná hra má problém jen z vnitřní politikou? Ale, bohužel, ne. Rozvoj vztahů je moc jednoduchý tady. Jestli chceš dobré vztahy tak jen můžeš nabídnout ostatním zemí otevřít ambasádu, pak mít kulturní výměnu, a společný rozvoj. A to vyřešeno. Teď můžete mít spojeneckou smlouvu. To funguje tak divně, že když jsem hrál za Severní Koreu, tak vynechal všechny restrikce uvnitř zemi, pak moc rychle dostal jsem spojeneckou smlouvu z Německem a ještě měli jsme dohodu, že moje armáda může se nacházet v Německu. Hrál jsem na normální obtížnosti.

Jak tady fungují války a taky nerozumím. Na mapě jsou obrázky vojáků, ale s nimi vždycky jsem měl bugy. Často z mapy mizely a znovu se objevovaly. Proces bojování je automaticky a není zajímavý.

Když díváš se na SuperPower 3, tak to vypadá jako dobrá hra pro mobil, když nevíš co dělat večer a chceš podrobit si svět. S tím je taky divný moment. Vývojáři píšou, že tato hra nejen o válkách, ale taky můžeme hrát pro ekonomický rozvoj zemí. Ale všechny scénáře jsou o válkách. 

Já opravdu doufám, že ta hra ještě se nějak opraví. Ale dneska, bohužel, nestojí to za to.","This is a mobile clicker.

When I watched the game trailers, I realized that I really wanted to play this game. It sounded like a good and interesting strategic political simulator. But what do we actually have?

Of course, I hope that the developers will still manage to fix the game and in a few weeks or months I will check again if something is fixed in the game. But in short, it is not worth playing this game in its current state. Yes, of course, you can play a little and then get a refund if you don't like the game. Well, I would recommend another idea: use the refund option later, when there are new patches and fixes.

The first thing I noticed was that there were no tutorials. That will probably be in the first days after the release. There are a lot of sliders, buttons and folders, but very little useful information about how it works. But the influence of various parameters is strange and almost always none. For example, when I played for the Czech Republic, I set a 100% tax on wages and, in addition, completely omitted all options for the development and stability of the country from the budget. That lasted two years. And as a result, support from citizens more than 50% and then I won the elections.

Well, ok, maybe the game has a problem only with internal politics? But, unfortunately, no. Developing relations is very simple here. If you want good relations, you can just offer other countries to open an embassy, ​​then have cultural exchange, and joint development. And that's solved. Now you can have an alliance treaty. It works so strangely that when I played for North Korea, I omitted all restrictions inside the country, then very quickly I got an alliance treaty with Germany and we also had an agreement that my army can be in Germany. I played on normal difficulty.

I also don't understand how wars work here. There are pictures of soldiers on the map, but I always had bugs with them. They often disappeared from the map and reappeared. The fighting process is automatic and not interesting.

When you look at SuperPower 3, it looks like a good game for mobile, when you don't know what to do in the evening and want to conquer the world. There is also a strange moment with this. The developers write that this game is not only about wars, but we can also play for the economic development of countries. But all the scenarios are about wars. 

I really hope that the game will be fixed somehow. But today, unfortunately, it's not worth it."
