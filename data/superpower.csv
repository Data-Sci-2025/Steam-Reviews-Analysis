I have chosen to leave a negative review of this game for a few reasons:

1. When you want to change the graphics settings, the game will crash. It doesn't just hang and take a minute to change them, it straight-up CTDs. So you're stuck playing the first mission in 800*600 and minimum graphics, even if you change them using driver suite software.

2. The new mechanics force you to choose a class. Support, Offence, or Defence, and build units. Wouldn't be an issue but you only have a limited number of swaps per instance. So if you're playing solo and are new to the game, this will get you caught out at least once.

3. Camera zoom is way too high. This is personal preference, of course, but it doesn't allow you to really see much going on outside of the immediate zone of control, severely hampering tactical awareness.

4. Story writing is bad. Just poorly written, badly acted, and not immersive in the way the older games were.

Overall, pick this up on sale, have a laugh for nostalgia's sake, then forget you own it. Never buy at full-price.","Most of the reviews about this game are around having to make an account to launch and play, it's 2025, every major publisher requires this. It's daft, but them's the breaks.

Em 2062, o Tiberium espalhou-se de forma descontrolada e ameaça a vida na Terra, com previsão de tornar o planeta inabitável até 2068. 
A humanidade encontra-se à beira da extinção..
Kane líder Brotherhood of Nod (Nod), chega à sede da GDI com uma proposta irrecusável, com o artefato Tacitus e os recursos da GDI para construir uma rede que controla o Tiberium.
Assim juntos criaram: Tiberium Control Network (TCN), com o objectivo de controlar o Tiberium e transformá-lo numa fonte de energia barata. 
A campanha em si começa 15 anos após a formação da aliança, quando a Rede de Controle de Tiberium se aproxima da conclusão.
No entanto, extremistas de ambas as facções GDI & Nod começam a causar agitação, o que desencadeia a Quarta Guerra de Tiberium.
O jogador assume o papel do Comandante: Parker, oficial militar da GDI que recebe um implante óptico após ferimentos em batalha que teve uma perca total da visão.

As a Command & Conquer game, it removed resource gathering and added a population limit. I play Destiny simply for the unlimited population. Besides, isn't Destiny's power system just another way to play the game? Destiny 4 is completely out of place. I'm not playing StarCraft, I'm playing Tiberium Wars. What on earth did these guys at EA come up with? As a 2010 game, its quality isn't even as good as Red Alert 3 (2008), C&C3 Tiberium Wars (2007), or even Command & Conquer: Generals (2003).

“Tiberium Twilight” is the last instalment of the famous Command & Conquer real time strategy series. Officially dubbed “C&C 4”, it’s actually number 9 if counting all the main games bearing the title (including the first-person shooter “Renegade” and excluding add-ons). Looking back at a long history and tradition of fast-paced base building, resource gathering and amassing big armies, at least in the 2D isometric games. The latest ones were trying to bring more of the “rock-paper-scissors” mechanics into the gameplay, with C&C Generals Zero Hour and Tiberium Twilight as the highest form of it. That also meant reducing or even eliminating the base-building and resource-gathering components. Generally speaking, C&C 4 is hence somewhat the last (yet in my view unfinished) step in a journey to adjust the series to a different play style with a potential reboot that was being discussed around the time of the release in 2010. The latter was dropped quickly after the commercial failure of C&C 4 and the demise of RTS in general.

The plot of the game continues and concludes the alternate future time line in which the world was dominated by two factions, Nod and GDI, picking up right after “C&C 3 - Tiberium Wars” quite well. Otherwise, unfortunately, the game itself feels incomplete and unbalanced on several accounts as well as falling short again on long-needed improvements on year-old problems such as a limited graphics engine and very low unit AI. Additionally, all the fans of the series who have loved the game especially because of the traditional mechanics might have their issues because of the new play styles. 

After about 13 hours of play time in a normal approach, here’s my pros/cons list:

Pros: 
+ seamlessly continues story after C&C3 and its add-on
+ high quality cutscenes and good quality actors
+ last and final appearance of Kane
+ interesting conclusion of the timeline, Tiberium infestation, the Nod cult and the legendary figure of Kane
+ great graphics
+ new strategic elements of mobile bases (= crawlers)
+ mutant area mission level design well done and detailed
+ interesting story in general
+ 3 tactics styles to choose from (offensive, defensive, support)
+ great unit detail
+ generally kept look & feel of C&C series

Cons:
-	Game mechanics feel like they were geared towards teams of up to 3 players cooperating in multiplayer matches against others, especially since some units and tactical advantages are missing when playing as single player
-	Kane by now definitely had many more lives than a cat
-	Apart from Kane, his cult and Tiberium conclusion, the plot remains shallow and rather bland
-	Rock-papers-scissors mechanics not working in single player missions due to missing variety in units available by only being able to choose 1 tactic at a time, limiting options drastically
-	Level-up to unlock higher units in most cases unobtainable and hence a player would choose a different approach --> balancing issue
-	Stealing big units from the enemy NPC can become main tactic in winning the single player campaign
-	Command points (= max unit number) limitation too low in single player missions to be able to stand a good chance against the enemy early on in many cases --> balancing issue
-	Missing option to tilt crawler position --> unfinished game element
-	Many missions are trail & error of each of the 3 tactical choices --> balancing issue
-	Unfair nuclear rocket behaviour in last GDI mission --> balancing issue
-	Super overpowered Arcus GDI enemy unit in last Nod mission making it nearly unbeatable --> balancing issue
-	Very unfair Nod pre-order bonus mission “Night Moves” --> balancing issue
-	Game is missing explanation of what the advantages are to capture some buildings on the map, players need to find out by themselves
-	Graphics engine is fixed to 30 fps due to necessary internal game speed regulation
-	AI of units still super low which requires lots of micromanagement (they can’t even pick the enemy which they are the strongest against or move in formations without blocking each other all the time)
-	Micromanagement of units decreases real tactical orders and behaviours to be expected of a modern RTS
-	AI still has wayfinding issues on the map
-	Despite resource gathering and base building eliminated, funny enough, the gameplay feels much slower compared to predecessors
-	Campaign missions rather boring and uninspired which is very sad compared to the super fun, varied missions of Red Alert 3
-	Tedious campaign missions, especially because of re-spawning crawlers (= mobile bases)
-	Soundtrack without any C&C characteristics, sounds more like a mix of Star Wars, Indiana Jones and psychedelic Japanese singing
-	Missing detailed explanation of 3 tactics, including differences in units etc.
-	Graphic bugs appeared several times, persisting throughout whole missions
-	Some game crashes
-	Annoying double login forced on player before game start and just before the main menu without option to save login information
-	Story ending of Kane somewhere between stupid (GDI part) and well done (general conclusion)
-	The protagonist’s wife is such a silly damsel in distress, unlike all the other strong women in earlier instalments

Conclusion:
Although C&C 4 wraps up the Tiberium timeline quite well, the plot is very shallow and boring. The new mechanics introduced appear to be unfinished and badly balanced, making many missions very tedious and sometimes even highly frustrating. I generally liked the look & feel of the game and was eager to try out a new tactical approach to the game play, but the downsides tainted my experience quite a lot. Hence, I can only recommend the game to anyone who wants to know about the conclusion of the series from a plot standpoint. From an RTS perspective, the game is rather disappointing, especially after an amazing Red Alert 3.

Conclusion:
Although C&C 4 wraps up the Tiberium timeline quite well, the plot is very shallow and boring. The new mechanics introduced appear to be unfinished and badly balanced, making many missions very tedious and sometimes even highly frustrating. I generally liked the look & feel of the game and was eager to try out a new tactical approach to the game play, but the downsides tainted my experience quite a lot. Hence, I can only recommend the game to anyone who wants to know about the conclusion of the series from a plot standpoint. From an RTS perspective, the game is rather disappointing, especially after an amazing Red Alert 3.

I bought the C&C Bundle with the interest of trying out the classics and C&C:4. 

I tried to boot up C&C4, same problems as other C&C games thanks to E.A scuffage of the IP - requiring online access and an EA account at all times with no offline option. Requires 2 separate login screens - the 2nd login screen is where the game-breaking bug occurs.

According to the Community, C&C4's 2nd login screen only accepts E.A Account passwords under 7 characters. Passwords over 8 characters will fail, and there is also a Character limit of about 14 characters.

There is no known bypass or fix for this bug.

I hope there is a fix, because I doubt this is the only C&C game affected by E.A's blasted logins and online-only enforcement.

Maybe a cracked version somewhere on the high seas exists without the Online requirement and E.A's nonsense.

Registration via email already exists - fine, I'll enter the password, that's even correct, but we'd rather send the code to the email (which didn't arrive). I think OK, I don't really care what email I play it on, so I put a new registration on a new email. There (after about 30 minutes of useless registration) I got to the ""riddles"" that I am a person. It took me a while to understand in broken Czech (the best thing is when the AI ​​generates a verifier that verifies that I'm human, I consider that a real goal), what the goal is, after clicking off I had to go through two more similar puzzles and finally I learned that I'm not human.

Tiene 2 Campañas, la GDI y NOD, cada una progresa de acuerdo a como va la historia del C&C, podes hacer misiones cooperativas, lo cual esta bastante interesante Y tiene workshop y editor de niveles.

What does this title offer? Something a little more in the vein of Warhammer 40k-like gameplay. Dawn of War 3 has RTS elements, but more simplified when it comes to base building.
It maintains the visual style already established in the last installment, which moves away from traditional warfare to a more futuristic approach, in the style of Starcraft, Dune, and, to a lesser extent, Warhammer.

It has two campaigns, GDI and NOD, each progressing according to the C&C story. You can do co-op missions, which is quite interesting, and it has a workshop and a level editor.

Unfortunately, it doesn't have achievements or trading cards, and there are some issues with logging in, but other than that, it's a great title; you have to know how to enjoy it.

Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight had the potential to be something unique, but the execution is missing something crucial. Instead of refining classic RTS mechanics, it replaces them with a limited, shallow system where strategy takes a backseat. The removal of base building and resource management leads to restrictive, small-scale battles that lack depth. The mobile base (Crawler) concept could have been interesting, but in practice, it makes everything feel constrained rather than dynamic.

The campaign doesn’t help. The story is rushed and unsatisfying, and the characters are bland with lifeless performances. Even Kane, usually a commanding presence, feels dumbed down and uninspired. There’s no real emotional weight to the narrative, and none of the characters leave a lasting impact.

I have tried the multiplayer, but it made the game a bit less boring. If the core gameplay is this flawed, no amount of online play can fix it.

This game could have been something fresh and exciting, but instead, it feels incomplete and uninspired. Even on its own, it just doesn’t hold up as a good strategy game.","Wasted Potential, Poor Execution

The way this plays is like anything but the previous titles that came before this abomination. It is fully deserving of having the negative review score that it does along with just never being mentioned about in the C&C fan base as an official game. Allow me to list as to why this is one of the worst RTS games I have ever played.

The leveling progression system:
Unlike the previous titles, where the way you unlocked more units and structures throughout the campaign, the way the progression system works is what I would expect to see in a MMO RPG game like World of Warcraft, not in a RTS game. In order to unlock more units, structures, and upgrades, you have to earn XP in game and level up to unlock more. Which makes this game outrageously difficult starting at the beginning. Especially in the campaigns, where AI enemies are absurdly strong having everything unlocked in the first missions, while you're stuck with the most basic of units that can barely do anything. This ultimately turns the game into a grind fest for the campaign missions and skirmish matches, just to be able to unlock more units and tech to make the game easier. And of course, levels you gain through NOD and GDI are earned separately, so you're having to grind as each faction to unlock more tech.

Unit cap and game play mechanics:
The unit cap in this game is absolutely obnoxious and unnecessary, especially since none of the prior titles ever had unit limits integrated into them (except for the console versions of RA3 and Tib wars 3 & Kanes Wrath due to hardware limitations on Xbox and Playstation), which makes the game feel smaller since you're now commanding only small squads of units instead of whole armies. The most you'll ever get for unit cap is around 50-60 unit points for campaign, and up to 90 unit points in skirmish or online matches. And it is horribly small, especially since a lot of the units take around 6-8 unit points, so you don't get to really build much of an army, as much as you get more of just a large squad of units instead. Of course, this can easily get broken if you get the husk repair upgrades while playing as Offense crawlers.

Speaking of which, instead of MCVs, you get a production unit/structure called a ""crawler"" instead. These just build all your vehicles, infantry, and aircraft instead of traditional productions buildings in prior games. This mechanic is one I hate the most, as I enjoyed having like 8-10 barracks or war factories just pumping out a massive army of units. Instead, you only get to build one unit at a time, with a max of five being able to be stored in your crawler while it's mobile. And the only crawler that can even build any sort of structures is the defense crawler, but that only builds bases defenses and nothing else.

Game play experience:
The fact that C&C 4 is an always online game means that you have to log into an EA account in order to get online and play this game. It doesn't matter how or which platform you use to play this, you still need an EA account just to be able to even fully launch this game. Even then, good luck trying to get on, as I've had multiple times where I'd randomly get forced out of a game due to connection issues and be forced to log back in, losing any experience that I gained during the middle of a match or campaign mission.

Overall summary:
I wouldn't consider this even an official C&C game. The way it plays and functions strays so far away from the C&C game series that it shouldn't even classify as one. The game play mechanics aren't enjoyable and generic at best, the level progression system makes this game grindier than it ever needed to be, and there's so many technical issues that it makes it honestly difficult to play. This is a game I would honestly recommend any C&C fan to steer clear from.

TL;DR
If I was given the choice to watch grass grow for a week or play this game for an hour, I'd rather watch grass grow.","This is by far one of the worst Command & Conquer games that is in existence, besides the garbage that is the mobile games.

In order to unlock more units, structures, and upgrades, you have to earn XP in game and level up to unlock more. Which makes this game outrageously difficult starting at the beginning. Especially in the campaigns, where AI enemies are absurdly strong having everything unlocked in the first missions, while you're stuck with the most basic of units that can barely do anything. This ultimately turns the game into a grind fest for the campaign missions and skirmish matches, just to be able to unlock more units and tech to make the game easier. And of course, levels you gain through NOD and GDI are earned separately, so you're having to grind as each faction to unlock more tech.

Unit cap and game play mechanics:
The unit cap in this game is absolutely obnoxious and unnecessary, especially since none of the prior titles ever had unit limits integrated into them (except for the console versions of RA3 and Tib wars 3 & Kanes Wrath due to hardware limitations on Xbox and Playstation), which makes the game feel smaller since you're now commanding only small squads of units instead of whole armies. The most you'll ever get for unit cap is around 50-60 unit points for campaign, and up to 90 unit points in skirmish or online matches. And it is horribly small, especially since a lot of the units take around 6-8 unit points, so you don't get to really build much of an army, as much as you get more of just a large squad of units instead. Of course, this can easily get broken if you get the husk repair upgrades while playing as Offense crawlers.

Speaking of which, instead of MCVs, you get a production unit/structure called a ""crawler"" instead. These just build all your vehicles, infantry, and aircraft instead of traditional productions buildings in prior games. This mechanic is one I hate the most, as I enjoyed having like 8-10 barracks or war factories just pumping out a massive army of units. Instead, you only get to build one unit at a time, with a max of five being able to be stored in your crawler while it's mobile. And the only crawler that can even build any sort of structures is the defense crawler, but that only builds bases defenses and nothing else.

Game play experience:
The fact that C&C 4 is an always online game means that you have to log into an EA account in order to get online and play this game. It doesn't matter how or which platform you use to play this, you still need an EA account just to be able to even fully launch this game. Even then, good luck trying to get on, as I've had multiple times where I'd randomly get forced out of a game due to connection issues and be forced to log back in, losing any experience that I gained during the middle of a match or campaign mission.

Overall summary:
I wouldn't consider this even an official C&C game. The way it plays and functions strays so far away from the C&C game series that it shouldn't even classify as one. The game play mechanics aren't enjoyable and generic at best, the level progression system makes this game grindier than it ever needed to be, and there's so many technical issues that it makes it honestly difficult to play. This is a game I would honestly recommend any C&C fan to steer clear from.

TL;DR
If I was given the choice to watch grass grow for a week or play this game for an hour, I'd rather watch grass grow."

193271976,german,2025.03.21 19:13,❌,✅,0.5344129801,2,"Spiel via Sammelbox im Angebot erhalten.

Nach der Installation musste ich mir erstmal einen EA-Account erstellen.

Nachdem ich nach ca. 2 Stunden endlich schaffte über den Launcher hinaus das Spiel zu starten,
durfte ich mich erstmal 4 mal hintereinander mit beträchtlichen Ladezeiten bei EA anmelden.
Dazu kam, dass das Spiel danach mehrere male abstürzte.
Das 4 malige Anmelden bei EA war jedoch nicht vergänglich und musste bei jedem Neustart erneut durchgeführt werden.

Die Lösung des START-Problems liegt mir übringens nicht vor. Kurz bevor ich es aufgeben wollte versuchte ich es noch ein allerletztes mal ohne jegliche Änderungen. Das Spiel selbst lässt sich übrigens ohne Internet-Zugang nicht starten.

Als ich dann zum allerersten mal das Menü zu sehen bekam,
erinnerte es mich ein wenig an eine komplett abgespeckte Version von C&C-Generals, nur in richtig billig.

Ein riesiger trostloser Chat, permanent aktiv, am unteren Bildschirmrand, angebliche Spieler die darin durchgehend angezeigt werden, aber keiner schreibt noch reagiert.

In den Optionen musste ich erstmal die Grafikeinstellungen hoch drehen.
Denn das Spiel schien mein FullHD-Display mit einer Auflösung von 860x640p und komplett minimalen Einstellungen als empfehlenswert zu betrachten. Danach wurde es aber auch nicht schöner.

Um rein zu kommen wollte ich zuallererst mal ein Gefecht gegen die KI starten,
bis ich die Option fand vergingen Minuten. Die Struktur des Menüs wechselte plötzlich von Hoch/Runter nach Links/Rechts.

Es gibt augenscheinlich keine richtigen Einstellungen für Gefechte,
ist aber auch egal, denn mehr als einen 3 Minuten ""Bitte Warten"" Timer bekam ich über eine Stunde Wartezeit nicht zu sehen.
Gefechte gegen die KI lassen sich einfach nicht starten.

Also startete ich den Story-Modus,
bei dem die ersten 3 Missionen scheinbar das Tutorial sind, waren mega schlecht, und waren gleichzeitig eine Einleitung in die Geschichte. Die Zwischensequenzen kommen in der gesamten Breite in Qualität nach C&C-1.

Die Grafik des Spiels ist absolute Katastrophe und schaut aus wie an C&C-Generals angelegt,
aber um mehr als 80% reduziert. Die Effekte und Bewegungsanimationen der Einheiten sehen so dermaßen schei...., billig aus, dass niemals das Gefühl aufkommt man würde mit schwerer Kiregsmaschinerie über das Schlachtfeld ziehen.

Wie bereits bekannt der nicht existierende Basisbau,
Gott sei dank gibt es keinen Basisbau, ich glaube ich hätte bei dieser schlechten Grafik/Animation das kotzen bekommen.
Nein ernsthaft... WO IST DER BASISBAU ???

Da es keine Bau-Voraussetzungen via ""baue DIES und bekomme Zugang zu DAS"" mehr gibt,
müssen Einheiten jetzt im gesamten Spiel, wie bei einem Multiplayer-EgoShooter, via Prestige-Ranking freigeschaltet werden.

Zusatzoptionen wie Untertitel funktionieren auch nur Just for Fun.

Ich hab nach nicht mal 3 Stunden das Spiel wieder aus gemacht.
Davon habe ich rund mehr als die Hälfte im Menü, in den Optionen, am meisten in Warteschleifen und ein wenig im Chat verbracht in dem ich hoffte mal jemanden zu erwischen der auch mal auf meine Fragen reagiert.
Bis auf eine Hand voll fragwürdiger Reaktionen auf Englisch, gehe ich davon aus das es sich wohl möglich um Bots handelt.

Fazit: Absolut kein bisschen zu empfehlen, nicht einmal ansatzweise. !!!!!!

PS: Ich suche immer noch die Funktion das Spiel wieder auf normalem Wege vom Rechner zu DEINSTALLIEREN.","Received the game via a collection box.

After installation, I first had to create an EA account.

After about two hours, I finally managed to launch the game from the launcher,
I had to log in to EA four times in a row, with considerable loading times.
On top of that, the game crashed several times afterward.
However, the four-time EA login wasn't temporary and had to be repeated with each restart.

By the way, I don't have a solution to the START problem. Just before I was about to give up, I tried it one last time without making any changes. Incidentally, the game itself won't start without internet access.

When I saw the menu for the very first time,
it reminded me a bit of a completely stripped-down version of C&C Generals, only really cheap.

A huge, dreary chat, constantly active, at the bottom of the screen, supposed players constantly displayed in it, but no one was writing or responding.

I first had to turn up the graphics settings in the options.
Because the game seemed to consider my Full HD display with a resolution of 860x640p and completely minimal settings to be recommended. After that, things didn't get any better.

To get started, I first wanted to start a battle against the AI.
It took minutes until I found the option. The menu structure suddenly changed from up/down to left/right.

There are apparently no proper settings for battles,
but it doesn't matter, because I didn't see anything more than a 3-minute ""Please Wait"" timer after waiting for over an hour.
Battles against the AI ​​simply won't start.

So I started the story mode,
where the first three missions seem to be the tutorial, were incredibly bad, and at the same time served as an introduction to the story. The cutscenes are, across the board, of C&C 1 quality.

The game's graphics are an absolute disaster and look like something from C&C Generals,
but reduced by more than 80%. The unit effects and movement animations look so crappy and cheap that you never feel like you're roaring across the battlefield with heavy war machines.

As already mentioned, the nonexistent base building.
Thank God there is no base building. I think I would have vomited at the terrible graphics/animation.
No, seriously... WHERE IS THE BASE BUILDING???

Since there are no more building requirements like ""build THIS and get access to THAT,""
units now have to be unlocked throughout the game via prestige ranking, like in a multiplayer first-person shooter.

Additional options like subtitles only work for fun.

I turned the game off after less than 3 hours.
I spent more than half of that time in the menu, in the options, mostly in queues, and a little in the chat, hoping to find someone who would actually answer my questions.
Apart from a handful of questionable responses in English, I'm assuming they're probably bots.

Conclusion: Absolutely not recommended, not even remotely. !!!!!!

PS: I'm still looking for the function to uninstall the game from my computer the normal way."

1 Вы хотите узнать концовку серии игр.
На этом всё

Минусы
1 Это сам геймплей теперь у вас нет денег все войска бесплатные но всё завязано на лимите войск
2 Нужен интернет при чём входить нужно дваждый при каждом запуске к игре! 
3 1 день зашёл играл норм, 2 день выбило какую то ошибку но игра зашла день 3 игра выдала ошибку несоответствие непонятно чего и решила больше не запускаться! Заебись! Виндовс 11 официальный 
4 Однообразный сюжет  Фактически мы играем в одни и те же миссии но по разные стороны, а концовка для главного героя одна.... То есть для нас а также для сюжета в целом... (У нас типо есть тело а сюжет это История тиберия и побелитель он не изменен!)
5 Вы не захотите играть в это онлайн да и врядли найдёте соперников. Игра в онлайн это захват точек и всё. (По скрипту игру проходил всю на пиратке на старом ПК лет 10 незад.) 

Худшая игра в серии игр!
","Reasons for purchasing

1. You want to know the ending of the game series.

That's all.

Cons

1. The gameplay itself: now you have no money, all troops are free, but everything is tied to a troop limit.

2. You need an internet connection, and you have to log in twice each time you launch the game!

3. I logged in on day 1 and played fine. Day 2. I got some kind of error, but the game launched. Day 3. The game returned an error about an inconsistency and decided not to launch anymore! Awesome! Windows 11 is official.

4. Monotonous plot. We essentially play the same missions, but from different sides, and the ending for the main character is the same... That is, for us and for the plot as a whole... (We supposedly have a body, but the plot is the History of Tiberius and Whitewasher, it hasn't changed!)

5. You won't want to play this online, and you're unlikely to find opponents. Online games are just capturing points, that's all. (I played the entire game using a pirated version on an old PC about 10 years ago, according to the script.)

The worst game in the series!

Steam would only allow me to review it once i installed and try to play the game.  I bought the C&C collection as I don't have to use a cd/dvd to play any of the games.

I forgot you had to login twice to play this game.  I just remember playing this game for 2 weeks, completing it and never playing it again.

so from C&C 1 to C&C 3 and generals, the games basically got better and the best game I found was the Red Alert series, but this game was so bad there was no C&C 4 Red alert.

so back in 2010 when I had bought this game, I was angry, I had completed this game, never wanted to play the game again and at the time, it was possible to sell games on the 2nd hand market, but this game I was stuck with.

All I remember this game was a completely new concept at the time, it was a shame it was not tested, but it was no longer building a base, but having a mobile control station and having a defence and offence command post and you no longer had to build a base, or gather resources.

so one of the best C&C games was generals and this game basically was the sad death of command and conquer.

If it was a good game, I might have been able to tolerate the digital rights management, but I basically played it for 2 weeks from release.

The only reason I have this game on steam is because it came with the complete C&C collection.

this game in the series is universally hated.

It is a real shame that EA did not go back to the tried and tested C&C, but just stopped the franchise dead.

I can't remember in 2010, if I had to install the physical game from DVD and there was a massive update that was needed to be installed before I even got to play the game and I think I needed to have the disc in my pc drive, log in to the EA account and maybe a further login, well this was at the time of really slow broadband.

The positive I can say about the game is, I managed to complete it and if I played it now, I probably still hate it, but my new pc would be able to run it at full graphics.

I still play Command and Conquer Generals and Red Alert 3, it is just disappointing that the multiplayer has been switched off due to the games age, but I have not played this game after completing it when it was first released.","I played this game when it was first released back in 2010

1.优化一坨翔。分辨率愣是没整明白，各种进不了游戏，搞个窗口化简简单单，或者弄个启动器设置选项。别整钥匙在宝箱里了行么？
2.游戏性总的来说，是一个让人拼操作的伪高玩游戏。让你迅速凑十几个相生相克的飞机坦克，然后搭配各种属性的技能，占塔或者搬宝石+比微操。太小众，入门难，没2个月别想玩明白，劝退99%的人。
3.最搞笑的是，兵种和技能要你升级经验才能获得，真TM搞笑中的搞笑，不然你就机枪兵VS对面各种战舰和要塞吧。
同样RA2，一个公司，你看看生命力。真别瞎作，创新是双面刃，创新创死的公司，远比一成不变被淘汰的公司多。
当然差评如潮也不是随随便便能得到的，而这个游戏就是那个王中王。","Pros:
The quality is decent, the art is decent, the music is decent, and it's built to AAA standards.

Cons: Everything else is just as bad.
1. The optimization is a mess. The resolution is completely messed up, and I can't get into the game. I'd rather simplify the windowing or add a launcher settings option. Can you please stop putting keys in treasure chests?
2. The gameplay, in general, is a pseudo-high-level game that demands skill. You quickly assemble a dozen or so mutually exclusive planes and tanks, then combine various skills with various attributes to capture towers, move gems, and even micromanage. It's too niche and difficult to get started. Don't expect to master it for less than two months, and it's a turnoff for 99% of people.
3. The funniest thing is that you have to level up experience to gain units and skills. It's hilarious! Otherwise, you'll be a machine gunner versus all the enemy ships and fortresses.
Same with RA2. Just look at the vitality of a company. Don't mess around. Innovation is a double-edged sword. Far more companies die from innovation than those that perish by simply sticking to the old ways. Of course, it’s not easy to get a lot of negative reviews, and this game is the king of kings."

My verdict is that this game is probably more fun for casual gamers and not serious RTS players. The gameplay was definitely watered down from the previous installments. I am a loyal C&C fan, so I wanted to play it to keep up with the overall storyline and check out some of the units.

PROS:
1. I did not think the units were that cartoony. I was impressed to see how they advanced. 
A. TITANS are back. Got to love mechs! Everything is bigger and more mechanized than before.
2. Excellent graphics that don't require a super expensive graphics card.
3. Classes can be fun to play and less stressful if you are a casual player. The whole game is very relaxed for a C&C game. I realize this is not the intent of most RTS games. Lol

CONS
1. Acting is awkward and stiff. Eg; Commander's wife.
2. While I like the soundtrack somewhat better than C&C 3's, it will never measure up to Frank Klepacki's backing tracks.
3. Mobile MCV game style is annoying. I miss building bases.
4. Female voice overs are annoying. I think it was clear the devs are trying to boast girl power, which I dislike and am strongly against having this kind of undertone in one of my favorite games.

5. The plot is interesting enough, but not great. It is all about the containment of tiberium on Earth and Nod forces are cooperating with, but also betraying, GDI forces. This is sort of a repeat of some of the last game's storyline. There are no scrin in this game because they had been pushed out and retreated in the last game. Still, it would have been more interesting to see them return. I guess this leaves room for a potential C&C5.

I won’t lie, I actually like the gameplay concept. It’s fun and less stressful, which is about the only thing I genuinely enjoy about this game.

What Doesn’t Work for Me?

1. Cringeworthy Storyline
The storyline is painfully awkward. Was it really necessary to add a romance subplot? Every time I see a cutscene where the commander (player) interacts with his wife, I cringe. The worst moment comes at the end of the NOD campaign when she cries over her hubby's death. It just feels so forced and unnatural.

2. Disappointing Music
The soundtrack is a letdown. The GDI music is passable, but the NOD tracks completely miss the mark. Instead of capturing NOD’s signature dark and intense vibe, it sounds more like tribal chanting from some random village in Kuvukiland.

3. Strange Unit Scaling
The proportions of some units are way off. Certain vehicles are unnecessarily large.. take The Forgotten's ""school bus"" for example. It’s somehow the same size as a Mammoth Tank, which is just ridiculous.

4. Weak Sound Design
The weapon sounds are underwhelming. Guns, cannons, rockets—none of them have the impact they should. Even the legendary Obelisk of Light no longer gives off that powerful ""ZWEEENG"" sound. And the rocket visuals? They're so tiny, they look more like fireworks than deadly projectiles.

At the end of the day, I know I’m wasting time reviewing a 15-year-old game that will never get updated. But still, what a missed opportunity.","This game likely wouldn’t have received so much hate if the developers hadn’t included the ""4"" in the title.

Четвёртая часть выпущена на новом движке, да и сама суть игры претерпела ряд изменений: не нужно теперь зарабатывать деньги, не нужно строить базы (оборонительный краулер - исключение, но об этом позже), стройцентр или штаб теперь заменили краулеры, которые совмещают все функции базы в себе. Краулеры бывают оборонные, наступательные и поддержки. По сути - игра сводится к скорейшему созданию юнитов и их быстрейшей прокачке. Количество бойцов ограничено, только в этом и сложность.","[Kane looks at you with a smirk]

If If you're familiar with the Tiberium Wars series, it's probably no secret that these strategy games are captivating. The fourth installment is released on a new engine, and the core of the game has undergone a number of changes: there's no longer any need to earn money or build bases (the defensive crawler is an exception, but more on that later). The construction center or headquarters have been replaced by crawlers, which combine all the functions of a base. Crawlers can be defensive, offensive, or supportive. Essentially, the game boils down to quickly creating units and leveling them up. The number of units is limited, and that's the only challenge."

So, overwhelmingly negative status, huh? You don't see that often. Also, it's a well-known fact that this game is a series killer. That's right. One of the most influential and important series for the RTS genre, the one that shaped and defined it the way we know it today was destroyed by this little fella here. How did that happen? To understand that we should first go for a quick summary.

1992 – [b]Dune II[/b] is released. Based on [b]David Lynch[/b]'s adaptation of [b]Frank Herbert[/b]'s novel, it introduced series' core gameplay. We were collecting [b]Spice[/b] with out harvester vehicles to earn credits and then spending those credits to build ourselves base and an army. 1995 – the first [b]C&C[/b] is made. While being spiritual successor of [b]Dune II[/b], the game had much more serious tone, while also including FMV elements. 1996 – [b]Red Alert[/b]. Pretty much the same thing with [b]C&C[/b], just with some improvements, naval battles [i]and[/i] an important backstory to [b]C&C[/b] villain – [b]Kane[/b], who was revealed as evil mastermind behind the humanity's major history events. 1997 – [b]Sole Survivor[/b]. Failed attempt for online-only deathmatch experience based on the original [b]C&C[/b] game.

1999 – [b]Tiberian Sun[/b]. The first game after [b]EA[/b] acquisition. Originally planned as much more complicated project, it ended up feeling a bit rushed, but still, in many ways it was a sequel everybody waited for. 2000 – [b]Red Alert 2[/b]. Made mostly by new members under [b]EA[/b], it rebooted the [b]RA[/b] series. Shared universe was no more. 2002 – [b]Renegade[/b]. Failed attempt to make next-gen mixture between RTS and FPS genres. 2003 – [b]Generals[/b]. The first game after the series' creators were shut down by [b]EA[/b]. Rather weird attempt to reboot series by dropping the old lore and altering core mechanics from [b]Dune II[/b]. 2007 – [b]C&C3[/b]. A pretty smart U-turn for the series that brought it back to its roots and felt a lot like remake of the 1995 game. 2008 – [b]Red Alert 3[/b]. A consoles-oriented game that felt more like [b]Generals 2[/b] and also introduced us to co-op. Thanks to which it felt more like online-oriented spin-off. Yet it was a very good game that lots of people loved. And [i]that[/i] was the beginning of the end.

How's the good game is a bad thing you may ask? You see, it made [b]EA[/b] believe that quick online sessions is what people wanted. You may expect them to learn from [b]Sole Survivor[/b]'s failure, but it was an ancient history, while at the moment [b]RA3[/b] was selling really well, so... Yeah. [b]C&C4[/b] was planned as a co-op-oriented project. Which... Isn't a bad thing per se. I mean, [b]RA3[/b] was good, right? Unfortunately, the fact that people swallowed [b]RA3[/b] being more [b]Generals[/b] than the original [b]C&C[/b], gave [b]EA[/b] another idea. An idea that... *SIGH* But OK, let's finally take a proper look at what we've got. And what we've got is... Anything but [b]C&C[/b].

I know, I know, it comes from a person who keeps saying that [b]Generals[/b] was not really [b]C&C[/b], but this here? It took every single [b]C&C[/b] element and flushed 'em down the toilet. Resource gathering? Believe it or not, it's no more. Remember the days we were arguing about [b]Generals[/b] having resource management similar to [b]WarCraft[/b] instead of our usual [b]Dune II[/b] thing? Well, resources are no more. No resources – no problem by [b]EA[/b] logic. Technically, [b]Tiberium[/b] ([b]C&C[/b]'s counterpart of [b]Spice[/b]) is still here, but it's just some crystals you'll be able to pick up now and then to upgrade units. Like I said, resource gathering? Not a thing. And so is a base building. Again, remember that old argument about how in [b]Generals[/b] we were able to build anywhere (similar to [b]WarCraft[/b] too), while “real” [b]C&C[/b] was all about the construction yard and things we were building around it? In this game we can't build at all. Well, technically, there [i]is[/i] one building. And the whole game revolves around it.

Everybody who played [b]C&C[/b] is familiar with the [b]MCV[/b]. So-called mobile construction vehicle was pretty much a portable construction yard. The original idea was to let us choose place for our new base to get the advantage we wanted. Now? Now it's more like our portable all-in-one base. Not only we can move it at any time ([b]StarCraft[/b] anyone?), it also acts like all other buildings from previous games. We build units, we purchase upgrades, we use powers... You've got the idea. Our whole base is just that – one fat [b]MCV[/b]. Where do we get money to produce units, you may ask? Well, that's a very good question, because in this game? You don't need money. You're free to build as many units as you want. There's a very strict population limit now, though, much more strict than in those [b]BLIZZARD[/b] titles. But that's just a thing. Forget about those big armies. Our goal in this game is, while only having a few units, to figure out perfect combination to outsmart our enemy.

But OK, you may say that simplified take on [b]Company of Heroes[/b], while not being a [b]C&C[/b] at all, may still be a good game. True. And that's where our second problem comes in. See, [b]C&C4[/b] is not a well-made product. Not even thought-through. The first thing you'll notice after the initial shock is... how hard this game is. Which... isn't even true. The problem is – single player campaign here is tied to your online profile. Remember the challenges from [b]RA3[/b] expansion? The ones, where you started with close to no technologies (units)? That's the stuff. You start single player campaign with nothing. Yet doing some skirmish grinding first will make it much easier. And a lot of grinding? You guessed it, there are no limits. Grind for the highest commander level (may take quite some time, especially since [b]GDI[/b] and [b]Nod[/b] are leveled separately) and get big advantage for your single player experience. What. The f*ck? Pretty sure single player experience implies dealing with properly calculated conditions. Here? It's a lot like playing story in some MMO. You stuck? Go grind somewhere else and come back later. Like I said, WTF?

Thankfully, most likely, you won't even get a chance to suffer through all that. Why? *SIGH* Did you play [b]Anthem[/b], guys? [b]C&C4[/b] was exactly that long before it. Starting [b]C&C4[/b] goes like this – launch the game, enter login and password for your [b]EA[/b] account, get an error, change password to fit eight symbols (don't ask me why) and voilà! The game works. Is it, though? Right after launch you'll be asked to enter login and password [i]again[/i]. Only this time even the short password won't help. Why? Because you need to have [b]EA[/b] app running on background. Again, don't ask me why (it doesn't look like the game interacts with it). Even after all that, there's still a chance for a game to tell you to go f*ck yourself. Hello, [b]Anthem[/b]. How you doin'?

So here we are. Not only this game dropped everything that we fell in love back in 1992, it also feels rushed (naturally, it's buggy and imbalanced too) and, well, it's half-broken. And it's all pretty sad, you know? The atmosphere here is quite solid. Moreover, the story is quite creative. It has FMV cutscenes, it's told from the first-person perspective and we, the commander, are the main character. The one who plays the most important role. We [i]finally[/i] got [b]Kane[/b] explained, there [i]is[/i] a proper ending for the [b]Tiberium[/b] saga... Sure, it's too short (game only has seven missions per faction), but still, with some proper gameplay, it'll be quite enjoyable. Unfortunately, [b]C&C4[/b] is a mixture of the unfortunate coincidences and bad decisions. When you look back, you see that such a mistake was inevitable. But it [i]is[/i] [b]EA[/b]'s fault that shot ended up being deadly. Dixi.","[h1][i]“Peace through powe... 💥”[/i]

Остання частина легендарної серії ігор, і цей факт робить усе моє та й більшості фанатів всесвіту Command & Conquer ще більш засмученими та кислими від досвіду проходження. Я й не буду дивуватися, що EA спеціально поховали надію на продовження у майбутньому та продовжили доїти більш прибуткові франшизи.

Почну зі сюжету. C&C не славилася своїми історіями та персонажами, але все одно вони привертали нашу увагу й нам було цікаво стежити за подальшими діями. Четвірка не дає ніякого чіткого розвитку всесвіту тіберія. Персонажі сірі та не відокремлюються від одне одного, навіть Кейн не може скерувати цю всю мішанину у правильне русло. Відсутні деталі та загально обізнані межі історії від завершення попередньої гри Kane's Wrath. Дані також не повернулися. А про скріннів взагалі мовчу - їх просто немає(тільки згадки), хоча величезний натяк на їх повернення був продемонстрований у кінці їхньої кампанії. 

Геймплей перетворився фундаментально й сам факт цього розізлив багатьох гравців, але на мою особисту думку проблема не в цьому, а в реалізації, Кульгає динаміка гри та гейм-дизайн місій разом зі картами й режимами звичайних матчей(а режим є тільки один - контроль точок). Не відчувається міць усіх юнітів та будівель, навіть бойові одиниці останього, третього рівня не показують страх на полі бою. Апогеєм розчарування стали культові робот ""Аватар"" та танк ""Мамонт"". Деякі війська мені здаються зовсім марними та не розумію нащо вони були створені(як сеймснік НОД) Присутність очків командування значно обмежує гравця та свідомо робить гру менш бажаною. Завдання, які нам даються впродовж проходження по сюжету, малоцікаві, а додаткові взагалі мають практично ніякого сенсу свого існування. Єдине необов'язкове доручення, яке було гідним виконання - це рятування полонених у місії. де ми ловимо Гідеона(""Нагорода за єресь""), а найцікавіше - вбивство снайпера(""Стікаючи кров'ю"").

Графіка приємна та не розчаровує, а дизайн юнітів є навіть іноді креативними. Саундтрек - єдина частина гри, яку можна та треба хвалити. Композитори не робили свою працю, плюючи на кінцевий результат.

У підсумку я скажу лише одне - мене поглинає смуток за цей фінал. Ставлю 4 з 10.

EN

The last part of the legendary game series, and this fact makes me and most of the fans of Command & Conquer universe even more upset and sour from the experience of playing it. I will not be surprised that EA deliberately buried the hope for next part in the future in order to continue milking more profitable franchises.

Let's start with the plot. C&C was not famous for its stories and characters, but still they attracted our attention and we were interested in following further actions. The fourth one does not give any clear development of the Tiberium universe. The characters are gray and are inseparable from each other, even Kane cannot direct this whole mess that is plot into the right direction. There are no details and well-known plot points of the story from the end of the previous game - Kane's Wrath. Data also did not return. And I won't say anything about the Scrin - they are simply not there (only mentioned), although a huge hint of their return was demonstrated at the end of their campaign.

The gameplay has changed fundamentally and the very fact has angered many players, but in my personal opinion the problem is not in this, but in the implementation. The dynamics of the game and the game design of the missions are lame, along with the maps and gamemodes of regular skirmishes (and there is only one  - point control). The might of all units and buildings is not felt, even the combat troops of the last, third level do not show fear on the battlefield. The apogee of disappointment were the iconic robot ""Avatar"" and the tank ""Mammoth"". Some seem completely useless to me and I do not understand why they were created (like NOD's aftershock). The presence of command points significantly limits the player and deliberately makes the game less desirable. The tasks that are given to us during the walkthrough are of little interest, and the additional ones generally have practically no meaning of their existence. The only optional ones that were worthy of completion are rescue of prisoners in the mission. where we try to catch Gideon (""Heresy's Award""), and the most interesting one is where we kill the sniper (""Bleed Out"").

The graphics are nice and do not disappoint, and the unit designs are creative, sometimes. The soundtrack is the only part of the game that can and must be praised. The composers did care about the end result.

In the end, I will say only one thing - I am consumed by sorrow because of this end. I give it 4 out of 10.",

Nun geht auch der Login warum auch immer ... Im Spiel endlich angekommen man denkt Cool ich kann zocken hehe nee wäre ja zu schön.
Mann muss erstmal alles einstellen Grtafig usw. ist das geschafft kann es endlich los gehen. Wenn mann aber denkt es ist wie C&C 3 wird leider auch sehr eintäuscht. Das ganze Spielprinzipien mit diesen sogenannten Croller ist mal sowas von blöd man hat Offensiv, defensiv  und Support. will man zwischen diesen wechseln muss man den zu vorgebauten Croller immer zerstören. Da diese alle Gebäude in einen vereinen. Man hat keine Kraftwerke mehr oder Fahrzeugfabriken  einfach nichts. Man ist beschränkt was die Einheiten angeht usw. C&C Scharm ade !

This hassle with the login alone is a disaster. The game doesn't even start when you install it from Steam. So I uninstalled it and reinstalled it via the EA app. But when you think it's starting, it's unfortunately not working. The EA app has to be open, and from there you have to launch the game once and wait for the error message from the EA app. Close the error and start the game from the desktop. Now you can log in, for whatever reason... Finally getting into the game, you think, ""Cool, I can play, hehe, no, that would be too good.""
You have to set everything up first, etc. Once you've done that, you can finally get started. But if you think it's like C&C 3, you're unfortunately very disappointed. The whole gameplay with these so-called scrollers is so stupid: you have offense, defense, and support. If you want to switch between them, you always have to destroy the pre-built scroller. Because they combine all the buildings into one. You no longer have power plants or vehicle factories. You're limited in terms of units, etc. Goodbye C&C charm!

Also wenns denn dann doch mal läuft wies soll...
Habe die komplette Reihe für 6 Euro bekommen und bin gespannt ob mich bei allen Spielen die gleichen Probleme mit dem Passwort erwarten... einfach nur nervig!
Die Missionen sind bisher (8 Stunden) sehr abswechslungsreich und mir offenbaren sich immer neue Taktiken.
Grafisch sehr gut gelungen und die Maps machen Lust zu erkunden statt direkt den Feind platt zu machen und weiter gehts - Das lässt der dauernde Zeitdruck aber irgendwie nicht so wirklich zu. 
Wer normalerweise riesige Armeen in die Schlacht schickt hat noch einen Grund zum umdenken denn die kriegt man einfach nicht zusammen.
An die guten alten Zeiten mit ""Generals"" wird es definitiv nicht anknüpfen können aber die Story zocken is Pflicht.
Das Spiel könnte noch sehr lange nach der Weihnachtszeit Freude bereiten... wenns denn startet XD","Actually, it's a worthy successor!

Well, if it finally works out as it should...
I got the complete series for 6 euros and I'm curious to see if I'll have the same password problems with all the games... just annoying!

The missions so far (8 hours) have been very varied, and new tactics keep revealing themselves to me.

Graphically, they're very well done, and the maps make you want to explore instead of just annihilating the enemy and moving on - but the constant time pressure somehow doesn't really allow for that.

If you normally send huge armies into battle, you have another reason to rethink things, because you just can't get them together.

It definitely won't be able to emulate the good old days of ""Generals,"" but playing the story is a must.

The game could provide enjoyment long after the Christmas season... if it ever launches. XD"

终于知道为什么这代要叫王八战争了
第一点，GDI和nod的MCV移动起来确实挺像一个乌龟的，移动贼慢，而且陆行MCV还有四条腿
第二点，这代的战役需要经常换家换地点，甚至你有三种类型的MCV，属于乌龟换壳了
第三点，这代战役经常需要你那MCV充当人肉护盾，因为这代MCV实在太硬了，硬的就像乌龟

移动速度，坚硬程度，作息规律，还真就是个王八

如果不叫《命令与征服》的话，设计的其实挺有创意和点子的，跟前作无脑堆兵冲点不同，这代你需要占领各种据点，据点可以为你提供火力掩护，你需要经常的去占领对面的据点，然后把自己的MCV开过去驻扎在那从而做到自己的领地向前推进的效果，因为这代没有资源采集玩法，而且单位有数量限制，你只需要专注于指定推进计划，如何占领地盘并把自己的MCV向前推进就行

也是因为这点，游戏节奏真的被拖沓死了，在前作你可以做一个囤囤鼠，在攒够一大波兵力后猛冲对面老家非常有爽点，而这代因为单位限制和玩法思路的转变导致传统的CNC爽点荡然无存，值得一提的是这代的满编轰炸机依然很带劲，推起单位来效率依然很高

总的来说这是一部不那么传统的CNC，如果它不叫《命令与征服》我或许会对这款游戏有较高的评价，但很可惜本作的一些转变让它玩起来不是那么“传统”，其核心爽点也应设计思路的转变而丢失，很可惜它叫CNC！","7.4 hours to beat. This is the most promising C&C game. It's not a bad game, but it's just a shame it's called ""Command & Conquer""!

I finally understand why this game is called ""Turtle Wars.""
First, GDI and NOD's MCVs move like turtles—very slowly, and the land-based MCVs have four legs.
Second, this campaign requires frequent relocations. You even have three types of MCVs, like a turtle changing its shell.
Third, this campaign often requires your MCV to act as a human shield because it's incredibly tough, like a turtle.

The speed, toughness, and regularity—it's truly a turtle.

If it weren't called ""Command & Conquer,"" the design would actually be quite creative and ingenious. Unlike the previous game's mindless troop-heavy rush, this game requires you to capture various strongholds, which provide cover fire. You need to frequently capture enemy strongholds and then station your MCV there to advance your territory. The effectiveness of the push is quite different. Because this game lacks resource gathering and has a limited number of units, you simply focus on a specific push plan, capturing territory, and pushing your MCV forward.

This also makes the game's pacing feel incredibly slow. In the previous game, you could be a hoarder, amassing a large wave of troops and charging into the enemy stronghold, which was incredibly satisfying. However, this game's unit restrictions and shift in gameplay philosophy have completely eliminated the traditional CNC thrill. It's worth noting that a full complement of bombers is still very powerful, and pushing units is still very efficient.

Overall, this is a less traditional CNC game. If it weren't called ""Command & Conquer,"" I might have given it a higher rating, but unfortunately, the changes made this game feel less ""traditional,"" and its core thrill has been lost due to the shift in design. It's a shame it's called CNC!"

遊玩性也是差, 和紅3一樣繼承了 ""將軍"" 的bug, 而且還弄了指揮官升階系統, 不是""將軍""那個, 是像網遊/手遊那種, 你自己的帳號有階級提升, 而且又分為GDI和NOD 各自一個, 只有解鎖更多遊戲內的成就才能提升更快;
雖然不用收集資源徵兵, 但徵兵有限制50~60單位, 但每種兵一個皆個佔不同數量的單位, 這就導致一場可能只有十個兵就不能再徵兵, 即時戰略這樣玩真的是...

Each time I enter the game, I have to log in to my EA account twice. Sometimes, it says ""error"" or ""wrong password"" when I log in (even though it's not wrong). I have to log in multiple times before I can even connect and enter the game. But I only play the single-player campaign, and the constant login requests are really annoying.

The gameplay is also terrible. Like Red Dead Redemption 3, it inherits the ""General"" bug, and it also has a commander advancement system. Not the ""General"" kind, but more like an online/mobile game. Your account has rank upgrades, and there's one for GDI and one for NOD. You level up faster by unlocking more in-game achievements.

While you don't need to collect resources to recruit soldiers, the recruitment limit is 50-60 units. However, each type of soldier takes up a different number of units, so you might only have ten soldiers in a game before you can't recruit any more. Playing real-time strategy like this is truly...
The game collects resources in each battle to unlock your own commander abilities...

作为cnc系列官方所搞出来的正传，违背祖宗之法打改游戏玩法，取消了建筑系统，经济系统，加入了人口限制（大概是工t1步兵3，t1单位6，t3大型单位12，总人口50），让系列本来宏大的战斗场景不复存在。剧情更是逆天中的逆天。本来好端端的科技树硬是拆成3份（进攻型，防守型，支援型），让单人基本上很难达成步坦协同，陆空协同。然后作为结局作，最后决战更是一点感觉没做出来。

即使抛开cnc这个系列印象也是一坨，作为一个rts游戏居然单位靠指挥官等级解锁，而且gdi和nod等级分开算。初始只有t1的低级单位，战斗力低不说属性克制都凑不出来，本来以为对战里拿着t1单位去和t2t3打以及非常逆天了，结果连过战役的单位都要靠等级解锁，没有等级非常难办。（不过也不算特别难办，因为就连最后一关都能锁科技上限为t1）

不过单位的外形还是不错，为各种mod提供灵感思路，也算是为数不多的贡献吧。","The biggest issue is whether it runs. Beyond that, other aspects are also unsatisfactory.

As the official sequel to the CNC series, it defies traditional gameplay conventions by removing the building and economic systems and introducing population limits (roughly 3 Tier 1 infantry, 6 Tier 1 units, 12 Tier 3 large units, for a total population of 50), completely destroying the series' typically grand battle scenes. The plot is even more absurd. The previously well-organized tech tree is forcibly split into three parts (offensive, defensive, and support), making it virtually impossible for a single player to achieve coordinated infantry, tanks, or land and air forces. Furthermore, as the finale, the final battle feels completely unrealistic.

Even putting aside the CNC series itself, the impression it leaves is still a mess. For an RTS game, units are unlocked based on commander level, and the levels for GDI and NOD are calculated separately. Initially, there were only low-level tier 1 units. Not only were their combat power low, but they also lacked any stat counters. I thought using tier 1 units against tier 2 and tier 3 units would be incredibly powerful, but it turns out even the units needed to pass the campaign must be unlocked by level, making it incredibly difficult without them. (Though it's not particularly difficult, since even the final stage locks the tech cap at tier 1.)

The units' aesthetics are still quite nice, though, and they've provided inspiration for various mods, which is one of their few contributions."

Je sais que beaucoup d'entre vous n'arrive pas à jouer à ce jeux, mais je suis là pour vous aider, c'est le C&C qui à encore des serveurs actif sans mode qui marche alors suivez ce petit ""tuto"" pour jouer au jeu.

Premiére chose importante, votre mot de passe du compte EA doit faire moins de 16 caractères. Le jeu est vieux et il faut vous authentifier dans le jeu et l'encadré qui contient ce mot de passe ne peux pas accueillir plus de 16 lettres (ne vous inquiétez pas pour votre @mail la c'est bon)

Deuxiéme chose si vous avez votre mot de passe qui est bon et que votre jeu vous affiche ""Erreur de sytéme générale"" ou un truc comme ça, réessayer  en faisant une erreur de mot de passe exprés: par exemple votre mot passe est ""truc1234"" le jeu affiche ""Erreur du systéme générale"" vous marquez a la place ""trcu5555"" il vous dit ""Mauvais mot de passe ou nom de compte"" et remettez votre mot de passe. Si ça ne marche toujours pas réessayer plusieurs fois en redémarant le jeu.

Voilà normalement ça marche, si vous voulez me poser des questions envoyer en MP je repondrais.

Bonne chance mes amis et donnons à cette licence la gloire qu'elle mérite parce que putain de merde EA de con de pire d'entreprise

How to run C&C 4 tutorial, for English people who want to play convert this following text into English:

I know many of you can't play this game, but I'm here to help you. This is the C&C that still has active servers without a working mode, so follow this little tutorial to play the game.

First important thing: your EA account password must be less than 16 characters. The game is old and you have to authenticate yourself in the game, and the box containing this password can't hold more than 16 letters (don't worry about your @email, it's fine).

Second thing: if your password is correct and your game displays ""General System Error"" or something like that, try again by deliberately entering the wrong password: for example, if your password is ""truc1234,"" the game displays ""General System Error."" Enter ""trcu5555"" instead. It tells you ""Wrong password or account name"" and enter your password again. If it still doesn't work, try again several times by restarting the game.

That's it, it should work. If you have any questions, send me a PM, and I'll answer.

Good luck, my friends, and let's give this franchise the glory it deserves because, damn it, EA, the worst idiot of a company.

Once you actually get it working you will be forced to log in not once but twice every time you launch the game, which will always be connected to the internet. I guess EA was worried that some people would pirate this masterpiece.

 When you actually start playing you will see that the gameplay does not resemble a C&C game whatsoever. No real base building or resource gathering. What do you think this is a C&C game or something? Well, it really does not feel like one at all. When I found out that this was originally an online only game made for the Asian market, which had a story attached to it to sell more copies during production. It all made more sense.
This brings me to the next point.

But Vogel, besides the gameplay C&C always had a fun story, Full motion video cutscenes, are those any good? The answer to that question my friends is a solid negative. The story feels like some lazy fanfiction that you would find on the internet. The cutscenes obviously have much lower production values compared to Tiberian Sun and C&C 3. Here is a good visual example of what I mean when I speak of lower production values.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=522954423

As I was watching these cutscenes I was wondering if Joseph Kucan (Kane) was thinking about the good old days when this franchise would feature Hollywood actors like Michael Ironside, J.K. Simmons, James Earl Jones, Billy Dee Williams and Ray Wise. I can't say I have heard of any of the actors who were cast for C&C 4 and frankly besides Joe Kucan,  most of them were not very memorable in this game. 
I like Joseph Kucan as an actor and I was always surprised that he did not have more roles in Hollywood movies, he would have been great as a villain in a James Bond movie during the Pierce Brosnan era, but I digress. It is just a shame that C&C 4 was the sendoff that a character as iconic in PC gaming as Kane and the C&C franchise got.

Some people would bring up the music as an example of something  good about this game but honestly, I thought it was trying too hard to sound ""epic"" and after a few hours of play I just wanted to turn it off. Especially the Nod soundtrack. Give me Frank Klepacki’s soundtrack for C&C 95 over this games soundtrack any day. Tracks like “Act on Instinct”, Remember the track that kicked off the whole C&C series? :)

Seriously unless you are a completionist like me and feel the need to play every C&C game, just avoid C&C 4 like a blue Tiberian field during an ion storm.","Saying C&C 4 is subpar is not news to longtime C&C fans, but after over a decade of pretending this game did not exist, I finally tried it.

Sure, it’s a departure from the classic C&C formula, but isn’t that what makes it unique? They ditched base-building and resource-gathering—yeah, it was bold—but the new Crawler system adds a fresh dynamic that keeps the gameplay moving. Instead of turtling in a base, you're constantly on the move, which makes things feel more tactical and tense. This constant forward momentum really changes the strategy in interesting ways, especially with the three distinct unit types: Offense, Defense, and Support. It really makes every battle feel different depending on which role you take on.

The story? Classic C&C drama. Kane’s back, GDI and Nod are still at each other’s throats, and there’s this whole apocalyptic vibe with Tiberium threatening to destroy Earth. I mean, it’s the end of the Tiberium saga! Sure, the cutscenes have less of that campy charm we loved from earlier games, but they still hit the mark for me. The narrative is darker, but fittingly so for a series finale.

As for the visuals, they might not pop as much as Red Alert 3, but come on, it’s still solid for a 2010 game. The unit designs are cool, especially the upgraded Nod Avatar walkers. People complain about the graphics, but hey, that’s hardly the point of a strategy game, right? It’s about the gameplay and that’s where C&C 4 shines in its own way.

Okay, I know the game has its quirks—logging in every time is annoying (especially when there are technical issues), and sure, the campaign can be a grind if you're not into the whole ""leveling up to unlock better units"" thing. But if you're patient, it’s totally worth it. The multiplayer and co-op are where this game thrives, offering some seriously fun moments once you get the hang of things.

All in all, Tiberian Twilight isn’t perfect, but it’s definitely not the trainwreck people make it out to be. If you’re a die-hard C&C fan, give it a shot with an open mind. It’s different, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing! It’s a refreshing twist on the formula and a great way to end a legendary saga.","Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight is such a misunderstood gem, I think it honestly gets way too much flak from the community.

泰伯利亚的史诗结局——直接一作把一个传奇RTS系列给埋了
------------------------------------
剧情怎么样暂且不谈。[spoiler] 给GDI打工，转正后就立刻死了老婆 [/spoiler]
只说遭遇战部分，取消掉经济运营和对抗，直接塔塔开和占点，然后通过强单位克制让玩家进行微操和调整部队编成，这套设计思路其实还挺有意思的。
但是将单位和升级解锁与等级直接挂钩的失败的逼肝机制真的毁了一切体验。等级不高你只能海低级兵造低级建筑，升级也没啥可点的东西，你的游戏体验是严重残疾的——劝退效果满分。
战役部分你能使用的单位同样跟这个等级系统绑定，而且制作组还自作聪明地加入了获取经验限制······进一步劝退。
所以对于想找个RTS游戏正常玩玩的玩家来说，本作不值得购买。如果你是想收集齐CNC系列、出于猎奇心态、打包买或者喜加一的话，倒是可以入一下——毕竟这游戏还能正常的启动和玩嘛（虽然不是每一次）","Level up and welcome the epic conclusion of the Tiberium saga.

Let's not talk about the plot for now. [spoiler] I worked for GDI, and my wife died immediately after getting hired. [/spoiler]
Just talking about the skirmishes: eliminating economic management and confrontation, focusing solely on tower defense and point capture. Then, through strong unit counters, players can micromanage and adjust their troop composition. This design concept is actually quite interesting.

However, the failed grind-forcing mechanic that directly ties unit and upgrade unlocks to level really ruins the experience. If you're not at a high level, you can only use low-level troops and build low-level buildings, and there's nothing to upgrade. Your gaming experience is severely crippled—a complete turn-off.

The units you can use in the campaign are also tied to this level system, and the team even cleverly added experience gain restrictions... further discouraging you from playing. So for players who are looking for an RTS game to play normally, this game is not worth buying. If you want to collect the CNC series, buy it for curiosity, buy it in a package, or buy it as a bonus, you can buy it - after all, this game can still be started and played normally (although not every time)."

First off, how did the cut scenes go down in quality fro C&C3? I know the cut scenes were never anything better than a subpar B rated movie, but these are poorly designed even by Westwood standards.

After these steps, I logged into the game on Windows and played it for a bit.
Got curious if I do the same for Steam Deck, if it would work ? It did. I didn't do any of the launch options for Windows and it just worked. I have no explanation. If you are a steam deck user, just wanted to throw this idea out there so you can maybe have a fighting chance.

Here is the SteamOS launch option version change the executable folder to yours: gamemoderun mangohud ""/mnt/n_drive/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Command and Conquer 4 Tiberian Twilight/Data/CNC4.game"" -config ""../CNC4_English.SkuDef"" %command% 

These are copy pasted through the Steam Forums credit goes to MaxSixTux.
Some people say that they were able to get it working without this but sadly for me, all of the steps below had to be done. I like the C&C series and with the price this one has, normally I would recommend it but because its so broken and it might become completely unplayable really easily, I can't recommend it any shape or form.


--------------------
1) Went inside the C&C4 installation folder (where CNC4.exe is), and inside the compatibility tab, enabled the Administration mode for the executable.
2) Logged on inside ea.com with their account (not through Google account token or whatelse etc.) but with an account registered inside their servers. Changed the password in order to have just 8 characters and no special characters (like &%@ etc.)
3) Surfed on the net and found this website: https://gist.github.com/JeodC/cb7d632d1f20646defd0b2d180d43beb

Went in the ""Tiberian Twilight"" section and read what they wrote there. They stated that you have to go on Steam and put an start-up line:

cmd /c """"PATH-TO-GAMEFOLDER\Data\CNC4.game"" -config ""..\CNC4_English.SkuDef"" %COMMAND%

if you check, there two "" after /c. Leave them there, is not a typo. Change only the part ""PATH-TO-GAMEFOLDER"" with the path directory of C&C4 (if it contains spaces it doesnt matter). For example mine is: cmd /c """"E:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Command and Conquer 4 Tiberian Twilight\Data\CNC4.game"" -config ""..\CNC4_English.SkuDef"" %COMMAND%

Put the line inside the start-up command line inside Steam and double-check Steam got it right.

4) Launch the game. If everything is right, you should see a CMD prompt opening and the foreground window shrinking to 800x600. That's normal. The game will launch. THERE, you have to place the UserID (not the EA ID, the User ID that usually is an email address) and then the 8 character password. It should launch then login (like what happened to me). There's not much people connected, so it should work pretty smoothly.

5) Register a ""commander"" name and then continue with the main menu.

战斗模式大改到被称为“王八竞技场”的程度，当然现在都知道本作是衍生品转正，也不知道EA高管抽的什么风。我寻思CC系列EA可没少榨，页游手游都有，怎么非要把这玩意转正啊。导致本作单人赶工的不像话还要套个莫名其妙的升级机制，终局之后也没新东西玩，经典的EA游戏生命周期。
可惜的是在当年简化RTS或者RTS转MOBA大潮中本作算是不那么拍脑袋而且有可玩性的那种，三种类型的基地把步兵/建筑、装甲/战场拾捡、空中/指令技拆开，人口限制规模简化操作，单位建造只需要时间方便转型，胜利点和科研点（泰晶）的博弈，刚出那阵5V5玩起来还是挺有意思的，但没有后续的东西自然是凉了个透。值得一提的是本作的单位是系列里最情怀的，什么都往里丢，2的悬浮导弹、巨像、NOD的钻地都扔里了，反正衍生作不需要在乎设定。如果当成独立作品长线运营说不准能把CC系列整个全塞进去，不过EA的长线……哈。

剧情不会写可以不写，设定改的天翻地覆赖不到赶工上，完全是存心的。凯恩从枭雄便乘有家回不去的可怜思金人，等了几千年最后成功润回去，思金巨塔的开启效果居然变成了消灭地球上所有泰晶恢复生态？虽然思金设定是挺俗的但这让思金变成啥了？宇宙环保大使么？于是凯恩升天成了双赢。而由此产生的十万个疑问中最重要的一条显然是：这个让三次泰伯利亚战争以及参战方便乘小丑的鬼故事到底是怎么通过审核并且真拍出来的？这就是他们的史诗结局？和质量效应3一样史诗是罢，突然开始担心龙腾4仂。

让回忆停留在CC3吧。","No one plays this game anymore. Why hasn't EA shut down the servers and switched it to a purely single-player game? You still have to log in to your EA account twice to access it.

The battle mode was overhauled to the point of being called ""Turtle Arena."" Of course, everyone knows this is a spin-off game being formalized. I don't know what's going on with EA executives. I think EA has been squeezing a lot out of the CC series, with both browser and mobile games, so why are they so desperate to formalize this one? This single-player game was rushed to completion, with a ridiculous leveling mechanic. There's nothing new to play after the endgame—a classic EA game lifecycle.

Unfortunately, in the era of simplified RTS or RTS-to-MOBA trends, this game was one of the less fussy and more playable. The three base types separated infantry/buildings, armor/battlefield pickup, and air/command skills. The population size limit simplified control. Unit construction took time to build, making it easy to transform. The battle between victory points and research points (Taijing) was quite fun in 5v5 when it first came out, but without further development, it naturally fizzled out. It's worth mentioning that this game's units are the most sentimental in the series. Everything is thrown in, from the hover missiles and Colossi from Tiberium 2 to the burrowing machine from Nod. After all, spin-offs don't need to worry about the setting. If it were a standalone, long-term project, it might even be able to fit the entire CC series into it, but EA's long-term plan... haha.

They can just leave it out if they can't write the plot, but the drastic changes to the setting can't be blamed on rushing; it's completely deliberate. Kane, ever since he was a tyrant, has been taking advantage of the poor Scrin, unable to return home. After waiting for thousands of years, he finally succeeds in returning. The activation of the Scrin Tower actually destroys all of Earth's Tiberium to restore the ecosystem? While the Scrin setting is rather cliché, what does this make the Scrin? Ambassadors of the universe's environment? So, Kane's ascension is a win-win for all. Of the 100,000 questions that arise, the most important one is obviously: How did this spooky story involving three Tiberium Wars and the clowns who participated in them get approved and actually filmed? Is this their epic ending? As epic as Mass Effect 3, right? Suddenly, I'm worried about Dragon's Ascension 4.

Let the memories stay in CC3."

[h2] Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5) [/h2]



As a long-time fan of the Command & Conquer series, I approached Tiberian Twilight with a bit of trepidation, given the mixed reviews it received upon release. However, I was pleasantly surprised by what the game offers and found it to be a unique and engaging experience that deserves a positive nod.

Innovative Gameplay:
One of the most striking aspects of Tiberian Twilight is its shift away from the traditional base-building mechanics that defined earlier titles in the series. Instead, the game opts for a more dynamic, mobile approach to gameplay through the use of ‘Battlefield Commanders’ and a focus on unit-based strategies. This fresh take encourages players to adapt to the rapidly changing battlefield and think on their feet, which keeps the experience exhilarating and fast-paced.

Compelling Storyline:
The narrative in Tiberian Twilight ties up many loose threads from the Tiberium saga, providing closure to long-standing story arcs involving familiar characters. The voice acting and cutscenes are engaging and well-produced, immersing you in the conflict between GDI and Nod. It’s thrilling to see how the game integrates its lore into the gameplay, making decisions matter in the context of the overarching narrative.

Rich Multiplayer Experience:
The multiplayer component is another standout feature. With comprehensive co-op missions and competitive modes, the game brings a sense of community and competition that can be incredibly rewarding. Forming alliances and strategizing with friends adds layers to the gameplay, making it an ideal choice for those who enjoy team-based tactics.

Visuals and Sound:
On a technical note, Tiberian Twilight boasts impressive visuals for its time. The environments are detailed, and the unit designs are striking, reflecting the series’ signature aesthetic. Coupled with a robust soundtrack and sound effects, the game creates an immersive atmosphere that draws players into the conflict.

While Tiberian Twilight may depart from the classic C&C formula, it introduces innovative mechanics and a rich narrative that have left a lasting impression on me. If you’re open to new gameplay styles and appreciate a compelling story within the C&C universe, this title is worth diving into. It may not be perfect, but it certainly stands out as a worthy installment in the legendary franchise.

The Tiberium story was originally long and extensive, but it was brought to a drastically abrupt end in this game. This behavior, coupled with the already weak RTS genre, and the release of such a low-quality title essentially doomed the entire Tiberium series. Therefore, the impact of this game's failure was far-reaching and devastating. DC Comics could reboot, and now, nearly 20 years later, I hope Tiberium 4 will do the same, deleting this game's single-player story before releasing the next game."

Stattdessen bekommt man ein Spiel das ständig abstürzt oder mit steigender Anzahl von Objekten auf dem Spielfeld (nicht im Bild!) immer langsamer wird, bis es völlig unspielbar wird - auf einem System mit Ryzen 5800 X3D, Radeon RX 6900XT und 16GB RAM wohlgemerkt. Schon lange vorher fangen alle Texturen an zu flackern oder komplett zu verschwinden. Dann ist ein Neustart des letzten Savegames angesagt,

Das sich auch das Spielprinzip geändert hat, sollte sich schon herumgesprochen haben. Es gibt keinen Basisbau mehr und auch kein sammeln von Ressourcen. Das hätte dennoch Spaß machen können, wenn alles andere gepasst hätte.

Inhaltlich bietet C&C4 eine hauchdünne Story mit überwiegend einer einzigen Cut-Scene-Kulisse für GDI und NOD. Von den coolen Zwischensequenzen der Vorgängerspiele ist nichts mehr übrig. Man hat nicht mehr das Gefühl in einen globalen Konflikt um das Überleben der Menschheit involviert zu sein. Selbst die einzelnen Maps wirken wie ein beengter Sandkasten in dem man mit einigen wenigen Einheiten herumspielt.

Auch der Sound ist kaputt. Bei mir waren keine Kampfgeräusche zu hören. Keine Schüsse, keine Explosionen, nur Musik. Die Nod-Kampagne hat ein wenig mehr Charakter durch die atmosphärischere Musik, aber das kann auch nichts mehr retten.

Aktuell kann man das Spiel nicht mehr kaufen, sollte sich das aber wieder ändern: Es ist absolut rausgeschmissenes Geld!



","C&C 4 unfortunately didn't deliver the brilliant ending to one of the most popular real-time strategy series with breathtaking graphics and a satisfying conclusion to the story of GDI, the Brotherhood of Nod, and their leader, Kain.

Instead, you get a game that constantly crashes or slows down with increasing numbers of objects on the playing field (not pictured!) until it becomes completely unplayable – on a system with a Ryzen 5800 X3D, Radeon RX 6900XT, and 16GB of RAM, mind you. Long before that, all textures start flickering or disappear completely. Then you have to restart the last save game.

It should have been clear by now that the gameplay has also changed. There's no more base building or resource gathering. It could still have been fun, if everything else had been right.

In terms of content, C&C 4 offers a wafer-thin story with mostly a single cutscene setting for GDI and NOD. Nothing remains of the cool cutscenes from the previous games. You no longer feel like you're involved in a global conflict for the survival of humanity. Even the individual maps feel like a cramped sandbox where you play around with a few units.

The sound is also bad. I couldn't hear any battle sounds. No gunshots, no explosions, just music. The Nod campaign has a bit more character thanks to the more atmospheric music, but that can't save it.

The game is currently unavailable for purchase, but if that changes: It's a complete waste of money!

Your best bet is organize a game on DISCORD find some C&C servers there. Discord  desktop app web app or cell phone your preference. And first google some Tiberian Twilight discord servers you can find people and organizing matches with perhaps.

Although you can use the support base skill to give free engineers to occupy the population limit of advanced ground units, it is of no use. They are not even as good as the archbishop next door.

For starters, to start *enjoying* this, you need to login with your Origin or whatever EA has to this day, twice, first in launcher, then ingame. Next up, you'll be met with music and cinematics whose tone doesn't match previous CnC games at all but does match the EA's executives at the time ideas of what people would like, the faction conflict of GDI and Nod is being diluted by personal drama of main character who gets to loose a wife that previously showed up for ten seconds but she's a woman saying a nice thing in your face so I guess gamers will forever remember her, and then troopers you serve with get pretty emotional too except the actors aren't the best at it so it comes off goofy and pathosy, and the forst first person perspective with neural network UIs is just over the top with it's flashyness. The art direction in particular seems very influenced by at that time EA's most successful Mass Effect series, you can see it in UI in particular. Music is also way more orchestral and pompastic than anything ever delivered by Frank Klepacki.

Now, the gameplay, it gets a lot of hate. I must say, but as a team-based, online RTS with focus on dynamic shift of frontlines and no preset bases it's kinda sound, conceptually, plus three distinct types of ""crawlers"" the mobile bases in a single unit, with one being able to push trough with best armored unit, another getting to deploy defenses and infantry that can garrison structures, and yet third getting mostly aerial units and special abilities. It feels kinda like a sci-fi take on World in Conflict, more gamey, but with defined player roles and sides constantly harassing and pressuring each-other. Problem is, the online scene never lasted with how badly this game was received, there's this absolutely insulting grinfingg mechanic where you need to complete missions, skirmishes or online battles to unlock new units, not as some alternative loadouts but as part of core progress, demanding many more games to be played than just going trough a campaign, and all unified for both online and single play, and finally, this gameplay just doesn't translate to as very enjoyable experience in singleplayer, you get to have a small, very modest array of like 8 to 16 combat units at a time, there's some situational additions like husks of wrecked heavy units like in CnC4 to capture if you can afford engineers for it, but ultimately you're just pumping samey units and treating it all like some micro-intensive small squad breaktrough thing even though your units don't have any micro-intensive abilities or benefit from taking cover or something, plus unless necessity dictates you need to defend a single point or need to cover impassable terran with aerial units, you'll be playing all missions with Offensive crawler, so you won't use the free occupyable structures the game has, nor will you be using special ability most of time - and since you'll often deal with more numerous enemy forces that replenish as fast as you, it usually all boils down to building the exact units that counter enemy's forces, collecting veterancy upgrades dropped by enemies, and keep pumping reinforcements while hoping you can hold up. Even repairs don't feel worth it when performed by your easy to destroy engineers, takes too long, so you're better off ordering new units that microing back for repairs, and let me tell you clicking one or two unit buttons endless is a downgrade for CC, going way back to tank spam days.

And going back to presentation, I must say levels look pretty nice, the supermassive industrial construction sites and futuristic green cities make for nice arenas, but the structures and units you get? They range from way more toyetic takes on something you've seen in CnC3 or even earlier games, to genuinely embarrassing, goofy designs. The developers had to even replace the pre-release Nod engineer because it looked like a goofy cartoon worm with a jetpack - and yet, many other designs in this one could have used similar reworks back in the day. And the story? Yeah, Command and Conquer cinematics always felt cheap and hard to take seriously but this one really feels like a new low with team just filming ""citizen interviews"" with dev team members on streets of LA, blatantly modern day LA without a single postprocessed-in thing all while ingame cities look radically different from modern urban environments. Oh and the very last cinematic is just a white void.

People say this one killed the CnC series and harmed the RTS as a genre for years. I agree. I don't think it's worth your time, if you grabbed the CnC collection you should have a whole load of great games, don't hesitate to pass on this one even if you're a true penny pincher.","This was loathed on release and where some games actually redeem themselves with time and effort or just don't feel as controversial in retrospective, this one still sucks, to this day.

Yeah, Command and Conquer cinematics always felt cheap and hard to take seriously but this one really feels like a new low with team just filming ""citizen interviews"" with dev team members on streets of LA, blatantly modern day LA without a single postprocessed-in thing all while ingame cities look radically different from modern urban environments. Oh and the very last cinematic is just a white void.

People say this one killed the CnC series and harmed the RTS as a genre for years. I agree. I don't think it's worth your time, if you grabbed the CnC collection you should have a whole load of great games, don't hesitate to pass on this one even if you're a true penny pincher."

C&C has some of the most iconic RTS titles of all time. This, sadly, is not one of them.

C&C 4 took everything great about the series and just sort of tossed it aside and went in a completely different direction. Instead of building a traditional base, you have this strange mobile command vehicle, where you recruit all your units and do everything. It's sort of like an all-in-one base. And BOY is it not fun at all. A big part of RTS games is building a base and managing your resources, but this game is like ""nah, we don't need that.""

Furthermore, there's also no resource gathering. You just gradually earn points that allow you to recruit more units. The unit limit, by the way, is incredibly low. This game seems to want you to micromanage just a few units, which I don't personally find nearly as fun. This also means, that there's no ""worker"" or ""harvester"" unit, and there's no way to attack your opponent's economy, other than gradually taking control of the map to earn your points faster.

If this had been a standalone game, people might have been mildly interested. But calling this abomination a ""Command & Conquer"" game was just a giant slap in the face to fans.

Sì, ammetto che anche io avrei preferito che questo capitolo avesse avuto il classico gameplay RTS come i precedenti Tiberium Wars e Kane's Wrath, ma complessivamente mi piace. Il gioco è molto incentrato sulla cooperazione e si basa su un concetto di 'azione/controllo' in cui si sceglie il proprio ruolo sul campo di battaglia (attacco, difesa o supporto).

Il Tiberium è sempre presente, anche se qui non è la risorsa usata per costruire le unità, ma serve per acquistare i relativi potenziamenti.

Yes, I admit that I too would have preferred this installment to have had the classic RTS gameplay like the previous titles, Tiberium Wars and Kane's Wrath, but overall I like it. The game is heavily focused on cooperation and is based on an action/control concept where you choose your role on the battlefield (offense, defense, or support).

En segundo lugar, hay poquísimas opciones a la hora de hacer estrategias variadas, solo hay creo; unas 11 unidades. Además, (aunque esto sea quizás cosa mía) la interfaz a la hora de hacer una escaramuza, no se entiende muy bien, oséase: no sé como cambiar la facción y otras cosas varias.

En tercer lugar: el juego no está en Español, aunque cierto es que eso quizá haya que mirarselo en la configuración. Yo lo he mirado muy por encima y no he descubierto nada relacionado con el idioma.

En cuarto y último lugar: necesitas crearte un perfil de E.A. para jugar, pero a mí al menos, me ha dado muchísimos problemas, en el sentido de que daba un error extraño cuando iniciaba sesión, estando bien la contraseña y el nombre de usuario. Es más, de los 28 minutos que sale que he jugado, 7 son porque mientras intentas iniciar sesión te cuenta tiempo de juego.

Conclusión: no te lo compres a menos que te cueste menos de 000,00 euros, y aunque así sea, dudo que lo vayas a jugar más de 20 minutos, como yo y las pobres millones de almas perdidas que compraron esto pensando que era un C&C solo por el título. Espero que te haya sido útil, aunque casi todas las otras reseñas dicen cosas parecidas.","This game is CRAP. I've only played it for about 20 minutes, but it's already made me sick.

First of all, the gameplay has changed completely. It's no longer a classic RTS of building your base and developing your technologies, but rather, you go with a single building and deploy units from there. Also, there are no more ""Tiberium fields""; in fact, there aren't even any resources; units are free.

Secondly, there are very few options when it comes to creating varied strategies; there are only, I think, about 11 units. Also, (although this may be just me) the interface for starting a skirmish isn't very clear; I mean, I don't know how to change the faction and other various things.

Thirdly, the game isn't in Spanish, although it's true that you might have to check that in the settings. I've looked at it very briefly and haven't discovered anything related to the language.

Fourth and last: you need to create an EA profile to play, but for me, at least, it's given me tons of problems. It gave me a strange error when I logged in, even though my password and username were correct. What's more, of the 28 minutes I've played, 7 of them are because it counts your game time while you're trying to log in.

Conclusion: Don't buy it unless it costs you less than €1,000.00, and even if it does, I doubt you'll play it for more than 20 minutes, like me and the poor millions of lost souls who bought this thinking it was a C&C just for the title. I hope it's been helpful, although almost all the other reviews say similar things."

Худшее завершение культовой франшизы и придумать сложно. Осталось всего две стороны конфликта, три МСЦ (оборонительный, наступательный и поддержка) для производства войск и горстка юнитов на карте, поскольку теперь появился лимит. Графика стала хуже, звуковая составляющая тоже. Сюжет шит белыми нитками, количество миссий слишком скудное, дизайн карт и юнитов безыдейный, безвкусный и не вписывается в общий лор вселенной. К тому же типы войск не соответствуют пилотам, сидящим внутри, а общие размеры машин огневой мощи. Ресурсы теперь добывать не надо, лишь удерживать точки интереса, прямо как в Company of Heroes. Зеленые и красные кристаллы тиберия подбираются только в специально отведенных местах и нужны для прокачки характеристик юнитов. Даже Джо Кукан в лице любимого всеми Нодовцами Кейна не вытягивает своей харизмой проект.
Это очень примерный образец того, что если маркетологи берутся за что-либо, то получается пятикратно переваренная субстанция. Поэтому можно сказать, что финал истории открыт, ибо эта часть неканон.
Брать только ради помещения данного образца в игрокунсткамеру!
P.S. Во славу Кейна!","[h1]WANTED A MOBA, BUT GOT ASS...[/h1] 
It's hard to imagine a worse ending to the iconic franchise. There are only two sides to the conflict, three MSCs (defensive, offensive, and support) for troop production, and a handful of units on the map, thanks to a new limit. The graphics have deteriorated, as have the sound. The plot is thinly woven, the number of missions is too meager, the map and unit designs are bland, tasteless, and out of sync with the overall lore of the universe. Furthermore, the troop types don't correspond to the pilots inside, and the overall size of the vehicles doesn't match the firepower. Resources no longer need to be mined, only points of interest need to be held, just like in Company of Heroes. Green and red Tiberium crystals are collected only in designated locations and are needed to upgrade unit stats. Even Joe Kukan, played by Kane, beloved by all Nodovites, can't carry the project with his charisma.

This is a prime example of how, when marketers take on something, the result is a substance that's been overcooked five times over. Therefore, one could say the story's ending is open-ended, as this part is non-canon.
It's worth picking up only for the sake of placing this example in the player's chamber!

В этой игре плохо абсолютно всё.

Сюжет плох. От третьей части идёт абсолютно нелогичный скачок, зачем-то вставили бесполезную любовную линию. Кейн потерял харизму, на видеовставках тоже видно экономили. Сюжет начинается с ничего и заканчивается максимально вяло.

От игрового процесса тянет закрыть игру поскорее. Строительства баз нет, добычи ресурсов нет. Теперь это МОБА. После шедевральной третьей части и дополнения к ней это выглядит как плевок в душу. От скриннов есть только упоминания в сюжете, играбельную фракцию выкинули на помойку.

Графически игра тоже стала хуже. Стилистика третьей части потрясающая, и когда включаешь после неё четвёртую, задаёшься вопросом, а это вообще та серия игр?

В общем, в этой игре абсолютно ничего не стоит внимания, сюжет проще посмотреть в записи за 15-20 минут. Ради геймплея играть в это точно не надо.","It was disgusting. I finished one campaign in four hours. I watched the second storyline on YouTube.

Everything about this game is absolutely bad.

The plot is bad. The jump from the third game is completely illogical, and they somehow inserted a useless love story. Kane has lost his charisma, and they clearly skimped on the cutscenes. The plot starts with nothing and ends in a completely sluggish manner.

The gameplay makes you want to close the game as soon as possible. There's no base building, no resource gathering. It's a MOBA now. After the masterpiece of the third game and its expansion, this feels like a slap in the face. The screenshots are only mentioned in the story, and the playable faction has been thrown out.

The game's graphics have also gotten worse. The style of the third game is stunning, and when you play the fourth game after it, you wonder, is this even the same game series?

Overall, there's absolutely nothing worth paying attention to in this game; the story is easier to watch in a recording in 15-20 minutes. You definitely shouldn't play it for the gameplay."

First, the connection is a hassle, and I have to install patches to get it stable (I registered an EA account ages ago, but rarely use it).

Sheffield tanks, Avenger tanks. Using a T1 tank against a T3 tank—what a ridiculous setup. I came here just to play the campaign, and it's just so awful.

Troops are very limited in terms of quantity, so I wonder how I'll get through a level where I have a maximum of 15 units against 4x the enemy's. It's still an initial mission, so in short, there's not much to train or improve... Unfortunately, it's unbalanced;
I don't want to say this about the game, but for me, it's a game far removed from C&C, and bad too. It's playable, but there are moments that irritate the player...
If you want a good C&C with good graphics, C&C 3 is definitely the best, or even the classics, which are also very good, are worth trying, even C&C 2, which I divided between love and hate...
My friend, C&C 4 was the worst I've ever played. If you get tired of all C&Cs, then play this one. You'll find a different experience, which for me was strange and unpleasant, but at least it's something different to try and take your mind off the frantic battles of the other games in the franchise!"

Como secuela y epílogo de la saga Tiberian puede resultar decepcionante, pero como juego en sí mismo es medianamente pasable y entretenido. A título personal, está lejos de ser el desastre que la crítica general apuntó allá en el 2010, año en el que se estrenó. 

El principal problema -si exceptuamos las comparaciones con otros juegos de la misma saga- radica en que 
replantea todo su sistema jugable que tradicionalmente consistió en gestión de bases de combate y unidades a favor de un sistema orientado al multijugador -no hay control de bases, solo un número limitado de unidades y un sistema de puntos-, así como defensa y conquista de torres. La jugabilidad que plantea es cómoda, más o menos se aprende rápido pero carece de profundidad porque apenas deja al jugador opciones para enfrentarse a los desafíos. El tono es lineal y de escasa maniobra. Es decir, es un título de estrategia RTS pero sin estrategia, solo dejando la parte de acción.

A día de hoy los pocos alicientes que un jugador puede encontrar para jugarlo es... la campaña, el modo historia porque el multijugador está poco más que muerto. Si eres fan de la saga Command and Conquer vale la pena jugarlo -aunque genere sentimientos encontrados-. Su modo historia tiene un planteamiento interesante -dramático, seria y con cierto carácter épico-; el gran inconveniente es su escasa duración y la falta de un mayor desarrollo. 

Un último apunte, solo necesitas introducir tu cuenta de EA/Origin para iniciar el juego -puede surgir algún error de inicio pero se solventa fácilmente volviendo a introducir los datos o esperando un rato-. 

Recomendado para el fan de la saga Command and Conquer. Por lo demás, un título pasable y jugabilidad anecdótica.","Tiberian Twilight is a title with many highlights and many shadows. As a sequel and epilogue to the Tiberian saga, it may be disappointing, but as a game in itself, it's moderately passable and entertaining. Personally, it's far from the disaster that critics generally pointed out back in 2010, the year it was released.

The main problem—if we exclude comparisons with other games in the same series—lies in the fact that it rethinks its entire gameplay system, which traditionally consisted of combat base and unit management, in favor of a multiplayer-oriented system—there's no base control, only a limited number of units and a points system—as well as tower defense and conquest. The gameplay is comfortable, more or less quick to learn, but it lacks depth because it leaves the player few options to face challenges. The tone is linear and limited in maneuverability. In other words, it's an RTS strategy title without strategy, leaving only the action aspect.

As of today, the few incentives a player can find to play it are... the campaign, the story mode, because the multiplayer is practically dead. If you're a fan of the Command and Conquer series, it's worth playing—even if it generates mixed feelings. Its story mode has an interesting approach—dramatic, serious, and with a certain epic quality; the major drawback is its short length and lack of further development.

One last note: you only need to enter your EA/Origin account to start the game. Some startup errors may occur, but they're easily resolved by re-entering your details or waiting a while.

Recommended for fans of the Command and Conquer series. Otherwise, a passable title with mediocre gameplay."

-Keep trying to log in, it will fail the first 3-4 times, but you will eventually get in.

2) played a few missions and then i got to this gdi one called cold hard truth, good god that one is annoying as hel cause the secondary objective requires you to stop this excavation teams from pulling up some old tanks from a previous war. okay i thought do that and nab them for myself no problems, only there is the sodding problem right away cause it goes one of two ways - either the ai bottles you up in a corner until they can nick these things or if you do actually bum rush them and get the tanks guess what, the ai spams these commando drone things that run up, disable and then out right nick them from you. oh and did we mention that these little buggers have an insane health/armour pool on them .... yeah have fun numbnuts cause if you do actually manage to kill the thing they just nicked, no biggy for them cause they will just run over and nick another tank in like 5 seconds. so your playing 5 mins of ""WILL YOU BLOODY KILL THAT IDIOT ALREADY"".

3) final point - tiberium is now pretty much useless what the heck, what i mean by this is in the previous game tiberium was everything. if you didn't have it your weren't building/upgrade/training anything so it was pretty much a necessity and i loved that cause it made me be strategic about what the heck i was doing and helped me control my enemies cause they too were bond to the need for tiberium but in this game is just a temporary power shiny thing and thats it. you want units oh no probs just use command points instead oh and your enemies have that too so good luck with the constant army spamming.

Pro tip: You can return the game at https://help.steampowered.com/de/. And only this one game from the bundle (there you suddenly have the option to select individual games). At least you can get €1.99 back, which the game wouldn't have been worth even if it worked."

1. Right-click your Steam game library, change the language to ""Traditional Chinese,"" and wait for the download to complete (if it doesn't work, switch to a US node).
2. Download ""Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight"" from 3DM. Traditional Chinese Version Offline Crack

3. Right-click the game and run the patch as an administrator to install it in the game's home directory.

4. Right-click the game in your Steam library, go to Properties, verify the game's integrity, and wait for the download to complete.

5. Open the game's home directory and run CNC4SERVER.exe (do not close this program while playing).

6. Log in to the game using the account in your home directory/Accounts/Mailbox/account.xml file (the external launcher still requires your legitimate EA account).

7. In-game, check the following settings: Options/General/Show Subtitles.

(Detailed tutorial link: zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/689964118)

[Notes]
1. The external launcher still requires your EA account.
2. The offline patch will modify your system's hosts file. To restore online functionality, please clear the hosts file.
3. Unlocking units in this game requires experience. You can modify the experience value in account.xml. Increasing it unlocks all units. However, the value cannot be too high, otherwise you will be unable to enter the game (you can simply reduce it in this case).
4. Please use the save/load function, as offline patches will prevent your level progress from being saved to EA servers. You will need to load a save to continue playing from where you left off.

*!-Wichtig-!* für den Ingame-Login, hier herrschen Unterschiede zu den heutigen Passwortrichtlinien  von EA!

Man braucht ein EA-Konto zum spielen, was eigentlich nicht erklärt werden muss. Benutzt dazu ein Passwort mit mindestens 8 Zeichen (aber nicht länger als 24 Zeichen), Groß- u. Kleinbuchstaben, eine Zahl und ein Sonderzeichen. Ich musste mein komplexeres längeres Passwort anpassen, da ich damit auch nicht ins Spiel kam. Viele schreiben hier, dass man nicht mehr auf den EA-Server kommen würde, aber wenn man das mit den Passwort beachtet, sollte es reibungslos mit dem einloggen klappen.

Mir persönlich macht der vierte Teil von C&C keinen großen Spaß. Hier wollte man wohl damals das Spiel für E-Sports Events anpassen, was nicht sonderlich gut funktionierte. Kein echter Basenbau mehr, sondern mobile fliegende Bauhöfe, hektischeres Gameplay und strategische Kartenpunkte die man zeitlich mit Einheiten besetzen muss. Das seltsame Skillsystem passt auch nicht wirklich in die Reihe. Ein absoluter Bruch mit der ursprünglichen C&C - Formel.

Wenn man das C&C-Bundle erworben hat, ist es halt dabei. Von einem Einzelkauf dieses Titels würde ich persönlich auf jeden Fall abraten, auch wenn Kane eine coole durchgeknallte Socke ist.","You need an EA account to play.
*!-Important-!* for in-game login; this differs from EA's current password policy!

You need an EA account to play, which doesn't really need explaining. Use a password with at least 8 characters (but no longer than 24 characters), upper and lower case letters, a number, and a special character. I had to adjust my more complex, longer password because I couldn't get into the game with it either. Many people write here that you can no longer access the EA server, but if you pay attention to the password, logging in should work smoothly.

Personally, I'm not having much fun with the fourth installment of C&C. They apparently wanted to adapt the game for e-sports events back then, which didn't work out particularly well. No more real base building, but mobile, flying construction yards, more hectic gameplay, and strategic map points that you have to occupy with units at a certain time. The strange skill system doesn't really fit in with the series either. A complete break with the original C&C formula.

If you've purchased the C&C bundle, it's included. Personally, I would definitely advise against buying this title individually, even though Kane is a cool, crazy character."

It's been out since 2010, but I've never played it until now, and now I know why. What you've done here isn't C&C, it's some cheap load of crap... how can you set a limit (50) on units that's quickly reached when some cost 1 unit and others about 5, meaning you only have a handful, and then there's this lousy single-player mode where you're the only one allowed to compete against two crawlers (construction yards). Even on easy difficulty, it's not easy. One thing I know for sure: when the game was being developed, nobody was sober. The cool thing is that you have to have an EA account, then log in twice at the beginning, and then you lose the server in the middle of the game, so you have to start the whole thing all over again.

Der Sarg Nagel der Command & Conquer Reihe...  Jeder Billige abklatsch wäre besser als dieses Spiel,

Der Erste Grund ist der Online Zwang.. beim starten muss man einen Account haben bei EA und sich  einloggen, aber nein nach dem starten Direkt nochmal einloggen und Passwort eingeben bevor man ins Hauptmenü Kommt.. Welcher Geistesgestörte Vollidiot hat sich  so ein scheiß ausgedacht???? Der müsste sofort ein Berufsverbot bekommen.
Als wenn das nicht schon Schlimm genug wäre, Bricht das Spiel Sofort ab wenn auch nur eine Sekunde mal das Internet abbricht, und schon darf man sich  wieder neu Einloggen..... Das Ist das Aller Letzte....

Zum Spiel Selber der Basis Bau wurde abgeschafft und es gibt ein Radikales Einheiten Limmit, Also Das Kern und Herz Stück der Reihe wurde einfach Herausgerissen,.  Dieses Spiel ist überhaupt eine Schande, Es Ist eine Schande das es überhaupt Command & Conquer heißen darf. Es Hat diesen namen nicht verdient,
Warum Hat man Nicht Lieber  C&C Generals 2 Gemacht den Generals ist eine meiner Lieblings Teile mit Alarmstufe Ror 2 und 3.

Hätte man dieses Furchtbare Spiel gleich im Keim erstickt gäbe es heute vllt noch  Die Command & Conquer Serie, aber mit dieser Schande wurde Die Reihe Begraben.

Die Story ist mega Platt und Langweilig das Ganze Spiel Prinzip macht keinen Spaß da man weder Gebäude Bauen kann noch viele Einheiten.

Ich Kann nur abraten dieses Stück Schande der Geschichte zu Kaufen....

Ich Hoffe  sehr das nach dem Remastert der ersten Beiden teile auch  weitere Folgen vor allem Tiberium Sun - Renegade und Alarmstufe Rot 2 und ganz Wichtig Generals mit Stunde Null....... 

An Die Entwickler dieses Spiels Schämt euch das ihr so etwas überhaupt auf den Markt gebracht habt und dafür auch noch Geld verlangt... Selbst als Geschenk ist dieser Teil eine Bestrafung...     Wascht euch rein und macht endlich  wieder gute Teile und Remakes der Alten Reihe, dann bekommt die Reihe Hoffentlich  wieder neuen Aufschwung.
Mir Blutet bei diesem Spiel wirklich  das Herz :-( Ich trauere heute noch um das Geld was ich  Damals zu Release dafür ausgab.....","I'm truly the biggest C&C fan since the beginning of the series, but this installment is the absolute last straw...
The nail in the coffin of the Command & Conquer series... Any cheap rip-off would be better than this game.

The first reason is the online requirement... When you start the game, you have to have an EA account and log in, but no, after starting, you immediately have to log in again and enter your password before you can get to the main menu. What kind of demented idiot came up with this shit???? They should be banned from their profession immediately.
As if that wasn't bad enough, the game crashes immediately if the internet drops for even a second, and then you have to log in again... This is the absolute last straw....

About the game itself: Base building has been abolished, and there's a radical unit limit. So, the core and heart of the series has simply been ripped out. This game is a disgrace. It's a disgrace that it's even allowed to be called Command & Conquer. It doesn't deserve that name.
Why didn't they make C&C Generals 2 instead? Generals is one of my favorites, along with Level 2 and 3.

If this terrible game had been nipped in the bud, the Command & Conquer series might still exist today, but the series was buried in this disgrace.

The story is incredibly flat and boring, and the whole gameplay isn't fun since you can't build buildings or many units.

I can only advise against buying this disgraceful piece of history....

I sincerely hope that after the remastering of the first two installments, there will be further installments, especially Tiberium Sun: Renegade and Red Alert 2, and most importantly, Generals with Zero Hour.......

To the developers of this game: Shame on yourselves for even bringing something like this to market and charging money for it... Even as a gift, this installment is a punishment... Clean up yourselves and finally make good installments and remakes of the old series again, then hopefully the series will get a new lease of life.
This game truly makes my heart bleed :-( I still mourn the money I spent on it back when it was released....."

Furthermore: Other games from the ""bundle"" that is for sale right now suffer from comparable problems. Like no widescreen support, no borderless windowed modes, crashes, instabilities...

Quick history about this title: This game was supposed to be a C&C game originally tailored for the Asian market, sort of a spin-off sorts with fast-paced battles and persistent online. However, in EA's infinite wisdom decided to make this into the next mainline entry to C&C and you can clearly see how that turned out.

First, the bad: Biggest one, there is no base building. Absolute heresy to me considering this is a C&C title, even their last big title Red Alert 3 stuck to the ways of the MCV! 

Second, the always online requirement. You need to be online to play this game, even in single player missions. This to me makes no sense if you do not intend to play multiplayer as when the servers eventually go offline, you have no way to play this game! 

Third, the intended design of this game. This game is heavily reliant on rush tactics, even if you play defense class. Since your MCV is the only major building you have to take care of, turtling tactics are not an option.. Plus, there's a unit cap which is also silly in a C&C game. 

Fourth, the storyline. Oh boy, did they screw this one up bad. Not spoiling anything but this game ignores a major plot point in C&C 3 which completely changes how the story progresses. Honestly, only the cutscenes with Kane are the only thing that saves this from being utterly forgettable, but even then it feels like the whole thing was rushed.

There are some good things I can say about this game. Firstly, the music. While not appropriate for a C&C game (lots of orchestral music), it does provide some semblance of competency for each track composed.

Second, the graphics. Ignoring the downgraded sound design (which seems to be lacking from C&C 3), the graphics do have the visual flair from what I assume is an upgraded engine from what EA has been using from Red Alert 3 and C&C 3. There seems to be some effort to really step up the graphics from all the previous games, shame that it's basically squandered here.

There is a reason a lot of fans consider C&C 4 to not be the conclusive ending to this great series and I do not recommend you go out of your way to play this game unless you're willing to deal with the always-online requirement and a sub-par storyline. Multiplayer may be fun at times if you know what to expect, but there are way better games that do this kind of gameplay. Unless you're here because of the bundle for all the other C&C games then in that case, understandable.","Ah yes, the much maligned final main entry to the Command and Conquer series that started from 1995.

Юниты по количеству ограничены, строительства как такового нет, так ещё и нет саундтрека от Фрэнка Клепаки (к слову сказать саунд всё же был более-менее неплохой, эдакая переработка классики).
Также не понравилось, что добавили классы (по три для GDI и Nod: оборонительный, наступательный, поддержка и у каждого класса свои юниты), из-за чего нельзя менять тактику при любой возможности во время игры и это как показалось сильно ограничивает разнообразие геймплея.

Геймплей был рассчитан на кооператив, но можно было проходить и на пару с компом, что и было сделано в первый раз в момент выхода игры. Второй раз уже проходил с другом, благодаря чему стало чутка интереснее, даже с учётом того, что проходил почти сразу после первого раза.

Сюжет в целом мне понравился, но из-за того, что большая часть игры всё же составляет её геймплей было не шибко интересно играть.

Очень понравилась проработка видеороликов, которые были сняты не со штатива, как обычно. Только вот финальные ролики с белым фоном как-то выглядели помню сомнительно и странно. Да и актрисы в этой части не особо интересные, если вы понимаете о чем я.

5 успешных вознесений Кейна из 10'ти.

P. S. Пересмотрел на днях все видеоролики на Ютубе и могу отметить, что сделаны они более интересно, чем раньше. Там больше движухи и меньше ""штативной"" съёмки. Единственное что в них худо - это очень мало компьютерных кинематографических видеороликов и нет красивых актрис, как раньше. Ну и русский голос дубляжа Кейна в C&C 3 мне понравился больше.","The most controversial of all the C&C games due to its new gameplay style. Units are limited, there's no building as such, and there's no soundtrack by Frank Klepacki (which, by the way, was still pretty good, a sort of reworking of the classics).
I also didn't like the addition of classes (three each for GDI and Nod: defensive, offensive, and support, with each class having its own units). Because of this, you can't change tactics at any opportunity during the game, which seemed to greatly limit gameplay variety.

The gameplay was designed for co-op, but you could also play it with a computer, which was the case the first time around when the game was released. I played it with a friend the second time, which made it a bit more interesting, even though I finished it almost immediately after the first time.

I liked the overall story, but since the majority of the game is gameplay, it wasn't particularly engaging.

I really liked the production quality of the cutscenes, which weren't shot with a tripod, as usual. However, the final cutscenes with the white background looked a bit dubious and odd, I remember. And the actresses in this part aren't particularly interesting, if you know what I mean.

5 successful Kane ascensions out of 10.

P.S. I recently rewatched all the videos on YouTube and I can say that they're more interesting than before. There's more action and less tripod-based filming. The only downside is that there aren't many computer-generated cinematic cutscenes and the lack of beautiful actresses like before. I also liked Kane's Russian voice acting in C&C 3 better."

Give him another 17th anniversary, and he can continue to profit from the studio he personally disbanded. On March 8, 2023, EA abruptly released the Command & Conquer Collection.

The result was a game with prehistoric resolution and unremarkable optimizations that sent players back to their childhoods. Even Red Alert 2 couldn't be purchased separately, requiring the entire collection to be purchased. Tiberium Twilight was a complete mess, and the login screen, which hadn't been updated in over a decade, demonstrated the conscientiousness of EA's actions.

A tank couldn't even hit the enemy engineers. Attacking bases basically meant watching the enemy engineers forcefully trade vehicles under fire. Even more impressive was the fact that even if a vehicle was destroyed, the enemy engineers could still emerge intact and forcefully trade. Even a three-star vehicle was no match for any armored vehicle; it was effectively a dead giveaway.

Switching to a defensive strategy, the bunkers were like paper against the enemy vehicles. Every machine gun shot was destroyed. The armored soldiers assigned in the mission took over ten rounds of fire to destroy the enemy humanoid mechs. The enemy engineers continued to forcefully trade vehicles under fire. The three-star mechs they stockpiled had no real room for damage. The three-star infantry squad that was supposed to clear the enemy engineers was instantly destroyed by the flamers...

In the spaceship crash stage, no matter what troops we sent, we couldn't defeat the enemy. Finally, we defended the mutant facility and spawned suicide bombers to demolish both enemy bases. The 50-powered defensive facilities couldn't stop three enemy soldiers from occupying the buildings... The infantry squad behind us was instantly destroyed, unable to stand for five seconds. We immediately sent support and blasted the engineers to capture the wreckage, finally defeating the enemy's baseless assault. Then, as soon as the enemy base spawned engineers, I exploded...

I looked for guides online... Hmm? Where did the mammoth come from?

I went out and saw that technology isn't unlocked with quests, but globally. You have to level up. Without a level, you only have the same troops in all modes... You have to farm GDINOD separately, and there's a population cap...

With a global lock, you can only play more skirmishes and farm. The skirmish population cap is 80, and the campaign population cap is 50... Even with a global lock, I get crushed in battles, and I can only level up to level 2. Even after leveling up to level 2, there's no tech unlocking.

I really don't want to grind with a global lock, so I'm going to just watch the story online.

真可惜没有介于“推荐”与“不推荐”之间的选项，游戏并不是特别差，只可惜被经营到一个半死不活的状态。
《命令与征服4：泰伯利亚黄昏》可以说是对该系列进行了一次大胆创新的变革。突破了传统的RTS玩法，也打破了曾经的CNC的游戏模式。但是变革也必将伴随着痛苦与质疑，尤其是顶着“《命令与征服》”这一沉重而辉煌的名号。
【“王八大战”的利与弊】
巨大的变革都在于此。
没有了前系列作的扩张基地建筑群的满足感；也没有了在同等时间大量堆兵的碾压快感；更没有了建造超级单位和武器的激动心情……
取而代之的是3种不同功能的移动MCV；双方共同被限制的单位人口；以及地图上固定时段刷出的升级资源……
基于种种改变，游戏的玩法也发生了巨大的变化。在本作中则更注重于不同MCV的功能与机动，并且玩家也需要在人口资源的限制之下决定在不同的时段应该怎样分配单位的生产与作战时的组合，再者就是该怎么利用手上现有的力量来完成升级资源的抢夺或者是达成任务目标等等目的。
由此可见，这一作更注重的是单位与功能的组合与资源分配，并且也大大提升了其网游化的程度，更推崇玩家之间的合作与对抗，尤其在团队对抗时，不同玩家选择不同的MCV也会有不同的分工与搭配，使得游戏性有了质的飞跃。
但是从反向来看，这样的改变也是带来了很多不利因素。头一个就是老派的CNC玩家可不一定认账，从内容上看则是有太多的简化，而且玩法上的差异也并不会让人立马适应而觉得玩起来会很舒服。而且地图的设计也变得更加死板，几乎是清一色的竞技向地图，大大减少初始站位的偶然性，使得其过度电竞化。最大诟病的因素之一就是糟糕的人口限制，虽说在一定程度上抑制了人海堆兵，但也减少了单位组合多样化的可能性，降低了战术尝试过程中带来的容错率。
总的来说，针对如果真的是找不来朋友，或者不能快速适应新模式的玩家来说，这一系列的改动则是失败的。
【旧碗装新饭】
一个“4”字可以说是正传的正统延续，但制作组却并没有因此去使用新的引擎，而是沿用了CNC3的老引擎来制作CNC4，所以不论是在界面操作，以及游戏内的操作都透漏着一种没什么进步的感觉，甚至会让玩家觉得这是用旧的东西改出来大型官方模组。一度还夹杂着赶工与减料的嫌疑。
【平淡却不得不叙说的故事】
作为最终章来说，故事内容是合格的，最大的缺点就是短小急促。但因CNC3和《凯恩之怒》的素质就已经摆在那里，所以本作作为最终章能做到这个程度也是实属不易。演员的演技似乎只有凯恩和妻子在线，其他演员略微有些尬演，而GDI司令弄一个黑人大妈来扮演多少有点zzzq的味道，而且整体看来显得相当违和。拍摄布景虽然显得简略，但表演者的镜头感则是相当的不错，也算是对此有另一方面的弥补。
故事依然是GDI 和NOD之间的对抗，但随着全球环境的恶化，人们也不得不在不同的理念中做出抉择。而主角“指挥官”就是其中重要的一位。他曾解救GDI的上司与其一同起义来阻止敌人的野心；也曾为NOD铲除叛党替身凯恩实现升天大计。终于信徒们去往新的世界，而地球也结束了战乱的循环。
如果说伴随着长达15年的陪伴最终要以这一作来画上句号，那应该就是在升天传送门打开时，凯恩对玩家说的那句包含了诸多意义的：
“谢谢你”。
不想完全压死这个游戏，只能说：
好玩，但并不耐玩","Since its ""dawn"" in 1995, the Command & Conquer series has reached its final ""twilight.""

It's a shame there's no ""recommended"" or ""not recommended"" option. The game isn't particularly bad, but it's been left in a state of near-death.

""Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight"" can be said to be a bold and innovative transformation of the series. It breaks through traditional RTS gameplay and shatters the old C&C gameplay formula. However, change is inevitably accompanied by pain and doubt, especially with the weighty yet glorious name of ""Command & Conquer.""

[The Pros and Cons of ""Turtle Wars""]

The huge changes lie here.

Gone is the satisfaction of expanding base complexes from previous games; gone is the thrill of overwhelming troops with a massive army in a given period of time; gone is the excitement of building super units and weapons...

Instead, there are three mobile MCVs with different functions; a population limit shared by both sides; and upgrade resources that spawn at fixed times on the map...

Based on these changes, the gameplay has undergone a dramatic shift. This game places greater emphasis on the functions and maneuverability of different MCVs. Players must also decide, within the constraints of population resources, how to allocate unit production and combat combinations at different times. Furthermore, they must determine how to utilize existing forces to acquire upgrade resources or achieve mission objectives.

This demonstrates a greater emphasis on unit and function combinations and resource allocation, significantly enhancing its online gameplay, fostering both cooperation and competition. This is particularly true in team battles, where different players choose different MCVs, resulting in diverse divisions of labor and combinations, leading to a substantial improvement in gameplay.

However, these changes also come with several drawbacks. First, traditional CNC players may not appreciate the changes. The content is overly simplified, and the gameplay differences don't make for an immediately comfortable experience. Furthermore, map design has become more rigid, with almost all maps oriented towards competitive play, significantly reducing the chance of initial positioning and making the game overly esports-oriented. One of the biggest criticisms is the poor population limit. While it somewhat curbs the ability to pile up troops in large numbers, it also reduces the variety of unit combinations and the margin for error when experimenting with tactics.

Overall, for players who struggle to find friends or adapt quickly to the new mode, this series of changes is a failure.

[New Rice in an Old Bowl]
The ""4"" character could be considered a legitimate continuation of the original series, but the development team chose not to use a new engine, instead reusing the old CNC3 engine for CNC4. As a result, both the interface and in-game controls feel largely unchanged, even leading players to believe this is a large-scale official mod reworked from old software. There's even a sense of rushing and cutting corners.

[A Plain, But Compelling Story]
For a final chapter, the story is passable, its biggest flaw being its brevity and rushing. However, given the quality of CNC3 and Kane's Wrath, achieving this level of quality is truly remarkable for a final chapter. Kane and his wife seem to be the only actors with strong acting chops; the others are a bit awkward, and the fact that the GDI commander is played by a middle-aged woman is a bit too jarring, making the overall effect rather awkward. While the sets are sparse, the actors' camerawork is quite good, compensating for this somewhat.
The story continues with the conflict between GDI and NOD, but as the global environment deteriorates, people are forced to choose between differing philosophies. The protagonist, ""The Commander,"" is a crucial figure in this conflict. He rescues his GDI superiors and joins them in an uprising to thwart the enemy's ambitions; he also helps NOD eliminate the traitorous stand-in, Kane, and realize their Ascension plan. Finally, the believers journey to a new world, and Earth's cycle of war ends.
If this game is the final culmination of 15 years of companionship, it would be Kane's profound words to the player as the Ascension portal opens:
""Thank you.""
I don't want to completely dismiss this game, but I can only say:
It's fun, but not very engaging."

Но она все равно может в любой момент разорвать соединение с сервером. Даже в сингле. А это для always online игры очень плохо.

В общем, она все равно уг по всем статьям.

***
Купил игру на релизе, но тогда поиграл 5 минут и понял, что она УГ. Спустя много лет решил все-таки узнать чем именно ""закончилась"" C&C, но это уже много лет практически невозможно сделать, потому что игра работает через сервера ЕА и они - вроде как - отключены уже долгие годы. Кто-то на форумах утверждает, что сумел пробиться в игру (не через первый логин перед игрой, а через второй - внутри игры после вступительной заставки - лол, да, тут два раза логиниться надо), но это похоже на байки уровня ""в моей версии GTA можно заходить в каждый дом, но я тебе ее не дам - папа не разрешает"".

Этой проблеме уже сто лет, она была в ориджине, теперь вернулась в стим. Есть еще в интернете какие-то танцы с бубнами с ""оффлайн сервером"", но на ориджине у меня в свое время не сработало, а тут даже проверять не хочу. У меня только один вопрос есть.

Как вообще валв позволяет продавать откровенным мошенникам игру, которую невозможно запустить?","Update: I found a tip online about deleting/renaming a file in the Windows folder – it worked, and the game reaches the main menu. But it can still disconnect from the server at any time. Even in single-player. And that's very bad for an always-online game.

Basically, it's still crap on all counts.

***
I bought the game on release, but after playing for five minutes, I realized it was crap. Many years later, I finally decided to find out how exactly C&C ""ended,"" but it's been practically impossible for years because the game runs on EA servers, and they've supposedly been down for years. Someone on the forums claims to have gotten into the game (not through the first login before the game, but through a second one – in-game after the intro cutscene – lol, yes, you have to log in twice), but that sounds like a story like, ""In my version of GTA, you can go into every house, but I won't give it to you – my dad won't let you.""

This problem is a long-standing one; it was in Origin, and now it's back on Steam. There's some online hype about an ""offline server,"" but it didn't work for me on Origin, and I don't even want to try it here. I just have one question.

How does Valve even allow outright scammers to sell a game that's impossible to launch?"

Для тех кто хочет  просто  узнать историю Кейна и сберечь подгорающий стул и не утираться от такого ведра помоев вылитых на вас разработчиками, то лучше просто посмотреть ролики на youtube.
Еще раз - это не Command & Conquer, а совсем другая игра, на которую натянули легендарное имя серии и сюжет. К покупке категорически не рекомендуется, разве что за халяву для коллекции. 

Теперь о игре:
Плюсы: только название и Кейн

Минусы - это буквально ВСЕ :
1. Базы - нет, вместо них ущербные краулеры (своеобразный ходячий цех) 3-х видов - атака,защита,поддержка. В итоге будете использовать только один (скорее всего первый - атака). Краулер защиты использовал один раз и то где требовалось по сюжету построить бункер (долго тупил как призвать этот крацлер, оказалось надо предыдущий уничтожить!!! кнопка [Del] в интерфейсе нет! или я не нашел), все остальное время атака (наземная техника) и немного для разнообразия поддержка (авиация). 
2. Сбор ресурсов - нет, если не считать выпадающие боксы из врагов(для улучшения юнита) и огрызков тиберия для развития технологий 
3. Постройка юнитов - абсолютное ограничение по количеству, причем не в штуках, а в  фиксированных количествах очков (каждый юнит свое количество очков)
4. Юниты - дизайн это что то  извращенное практически никак не похожее на предыдущие серии, кроме нескольких видов (таких как мамонт-танк, мастодонт и тп). Например танк скорпион - это реально по виду насекомое с обелиском на хвосте ) В процессе игры вы будете из всего разнообразия использовать только пару видов + ремонтник 
5. Геймплэй - забудьте то зачем мы пришли в С&С, больше нет того очарования строительства баз, сбор такого драгоценного тиберия,  отслеживание этих неуклюжих харвестеров, требующих постоянной опеки, рэйды авиацией,  накопление сил, защиты базы, атаки на врага ударной группировкой, запуск ядерной ракеты или удары спутником....... ничего этого нет.  Больше не испытать того чувства  когда вырастает только что построенный обелиск в пылу защиты вашей базы и такой чарующий звук зззззззззз-пиу. Будут только небольшие локальные стычки по всей карте ограниченным контингентом юнитов.
6. Графика - как движок нормально, как дизайн - ужас. Художественное оформления начиная от меню, карты и заканчивая юнитами совершенно не в стиле С&С. Ощущение другой игры будет вас преследовать на всем протяжении истории.
7. Видеоролики - как по мне так на троечку. Занудно, непонятно зачем вплетена, довольно несуразно, линия отношений Коммандера и его жены. 
8. Музыка - это пипец и днище, не потому что плохая, а потому что классическая музыка и композиции с фолк (Фолк Карл!!!) мотивами выглядят чужеродно для этой  игры. 
9. Постоянно  при запуска требует ввода пароля от EA, причем одного раза мало - дважды!  Регистрация тоже квэст, который нужно пройти через лаунчер EA и там ввести сначала ключ из Стима (есть руководство как это сделать можете найти)

Если ЕА действительно хотела закончить серию, то покончить с ней ей действительно получилось в отличии от самой игры.","In short, this isn't C&C (Command & Conquer), it's a slap in the face to the entire fandom of the series.

For those who simply want to learn Kane's story and save their burning chair, rather than have to deal with the developers' filth, it's best to just watch the videos on YouTube.
Again, this isn't Command & Conquer, but a completely different game, stretching the series' legendary name and plot. It's strongly not recommended for purchase, unless you're looking for a freebie to add to your collection.

Now about the game:
Pros: just the name and Kane.

Cons: literally EVERYTHING:
1. There are no bases, instead there are crippled crawlers (a kind of walking workshop) of three types – attack, defense, and support. Ultimately, you'll only use one (most likely the first – attack). I used the Defense Crawler once, and that was when the story required me to build a bunker (I struggled with how to summon this crawler for a long time, but it turns out I had to destroy the previous one!!! There's no [Del] button in the interface! Or maybe I couldn't find it). The rest of the time, I'm attacking (ground vehicles) and, for variety, supporting (aircraft).

2. Resource collection - none, unless you count the boxes dropped by enemies (for unit upgrades) and Tiberium cores for technology development.
3. Unit construction - an absolute limit on quantity, not in units, but in fixed points (each unit has its own point value).
4. Unit design is something perverse, practically unlike previous series, with the exception of a few types (such as the Mammoth Tank, Mastodon, etc.). For example, the Scorpion tank actually looks like an insect with an obelisk on its tail. During the game, you'll only use a couple of different types and a repair tank.
5. Gameplay - forget why we came to S&S in the first place. The charm of building bases, collecting precious Tiberium, tracking those clumsy harvesters that require constant care, air raids, amassing forces, defending a base, attacking the enemy with a strike force, launching a nuclear missile, or launching satellite strikes is gone. None of that is there. You won't experience that feeling of a newly built obelisk rising in the heat of defending your base, accompanied by that enchanting zzzzzzzzzzz-pew sound. There will only be small, localized skirmishes across the map with a limited number of units.
6. Graphics - the engine is fine, but the design is terrible. The art, from the menus and maps to the units, is completely uninspired by S&S. The feeling of playing a different game will haunt you throughout the entire story.
7. The cutscenes are a C, in my opinion. The storyline between the Commander and his wife is tedious, and the storyline is woven inconsequentially and awkwardly.

8. The music is abysmal, not because it's bad, but because classical music and compositions with folk (Folk Carl!!!) motifs feel out of place in this game.

9. It constantly asks you to enter your EA password upon launch, and once isn't enough – twice! Registration is also a quest, requiring you to go through the EA launcher and enter your Steam key first (there's a guide on how to do this, you can find it here).

If EA really wanted to end the series, they really succeeded, unlike the game itself."

[b]ремастер категорически рекомендую!  [/b]   [/i] 


играть в C&C начал с red alert на первой PS сто тысяч лет назад, с этой rts  у меня любовь на века. прошел  C&C вдоль и поперек.

Generals вызывал по-началу небольшие сомнения, но уже после пары миссий  пролетел всю кампанию на одном дыхании, а после и адон заценил. исключение только одно-уродливый выкидыш с цифрой 4, его бросил через 10 часов игры и забыл. tiberian dawn, который я почему-то пропустил, стал настоящим подарком от разрабов.  отыграл кампанию за ГСБ на сложной, получив нереальный фан. дальше с большим  удовольствием пройду за НОД, а после обязательно понастальгирую  в red alert.

ремастер получился весьма годный, это все тот же эталон, но с посвежевшей картинкой, которая определенно радует глаз и новым саундом, который так же хорош, как и в класической игре.  хотя я принципиально не беру игры дороже 5-6 сотен рублей, здесь потраченные полтора рубля абсолютно не жалко! 

[b]ЭТО МАМОНТ, ЖДУ УКАЗАНИЙ [/b]","[h1] C&C Remaster Review![/h1]

[i] The beautiful and awesome region block prevents me from reviewing the remaster.
[b]I highly recommend the remaster! [/b] [/i]

I started playing C&C with Red Alert on the first PS4 a hundred thousand years ago, and I've been in love with this RTS for ages. I've played C&C through and through.

Generals was a bit iffy at first, but after a couple of missions, I blew through the entire campaign in one breath, and then I really appreciated the expansion pack. The only exception was the ugly miscarriage with the number 4; I abandoned it after 10 hours of play and forgot about it. Tiberian Dawn, which I somehow missed, was a real gift from the developers. I played the GDI campaign on hard mode and had incredible fun. I'll be thrilled to play through the rest of the campaign with Nod, and then I'll definitely revel in Red Alert.

The remaster turned out quite well; it's still the same standard, but with a refreshed visual style that's definitely pleasing to the eye and a new soundtrack that's just as good as the classic game's. While I generally don't buy games over 500-600 rubles, the extra 1.5 rubles spent here are absolutely worth it!

Als jemand, der als Kind Command & Conquer auf der PS1 geliebt hat und nun die Teile auf Steam nachholt, habe ich mich sehr auf dieses Spiel gefreut. Leider wurde meine Erwartungen nicht erfüllt.

Ein deutliches Problem in Command & Conquer 4 ist das offensichtliche EA-Prinzip, Spieleentwickler zu kaufen und dann Spiele in kurzen Abständen herauszubringen, bis die einst erfolgreiche Spielereihe letztendlich kaputt ist. Dies hat auch hier seine Spuren hinterlassen. Das Spiel fühlt sich nicht mehr wie ein authentisches Command & Conquer an, sondern eher wie ein liebloses Produkt, das nur darauf aus ist, Geld zu generieren.

Die technische Umsetzung von Command & Conquer 4 lässt zu wünschen übrig. Die Grafik ist zwar solide für die Zeit, aber es gibt technische Probleme und Ungenauigkeiten, die das Spielerlebnis beeinträchtigen und den Spaß nehmen. Man quält sich beinahe durch das Spiel.

Alles in allem kann ich Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight nur als enttäuschend bezeichnen. Es ist ein Beispiel dafür, wie eine einst erfolgreiche Spielereihe durch das Einmischen von EA ruiniert werden kann. 

Keine Kaufempfehlung","Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight is a disappointing sequel to a once-great series. As someone who loved Command & Conquer on the PS1 as a child and is now catching up on the games on Steam, I was really looking forward to this game. Unfortunately, my expectations weren't met.

A clear problem with Command & Conquer 4 is EA's obvious policy of buying up game developers and then releasing games in quick succession until the once-successful series is ultimately destroyed. This has left its mark here as well. The game no longer feels like an authentic Command & Conquer, but more like a loveless product designed solely to generate money.

The technical implementation of Command & Conquer 4 leaves much to be desired. While the graphics are solid for its time, there are technical issues and inaccuracies that detract from the gameplay and take the fun out of it. You almost struggle through the game.

All in all, I can only describe Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight as disappointing. It's an example of how a once successful game series can be ruined by EA's meddling.

Not recommended."

Для начало я не играл ни в одну игру из этой вселенной кроме вот этой, но я смотрел так сказать историю происходящего персонажей и как оно появилось и чем закончилось и так же смотрел все ответления от основной части так же смотрел графу и сам по себе гемплей.
Я скажу так мне эта часть игры очень нравится хотя бы по той причине что у неё графика для своего года очень классная и модельки пехоты и строений тоже нравится, единственное что огорчает это лимит на пехоты и строений (насчёт пехоты и строений я не знаю был ли лимит в прошлых частях хотя наскок понял или не было или был но и того и другого можно было создать много) ещё огорчает то что слишком маленький сюжет и честно скажу слишком высокая ценна для этой игры потому что хочется больше сюжета чем графики.
Это было моё мнение насчёт игры чисто субъективное а теперь совет тем кто всё же захочет её купить понимаю что мало и вряд ли понадобится учитывая что игра мёртвая почти но всё же,
если вы играли в прошлые части этой игры то вам вряд ли понравится эта часть из за короткости и маленького лимита на производство пехоты и строений но всё же, если решитесь её купить то только по скидке ибо ценна и в правду кусается","I want to express my opinion on this game. First off, I haven't played any games from this universe except this one, but I did follow the backstory of the characters, how they came to be, how they ended, and I also watched all the spinoffs from the main game, as well as the graphics and the gameplay itself.
I'll say this: I really like this part of the game, if only because the graphics are very cool for its age, and I also like the infantry and building models. The only thing that's disappointing is the limit on infantry and buildings (I don't know if there was a limit on infantry and buildings in the previous games, although I quickly figured out whether there was one, or not, but you could have created a lot of both). Another disappointment is that the story is too short, and frankly, the price tag is too high for this game because I want more story than graphics. This was my purely subjective opinion about the game, but now my advice to those who still want to buy it. I understand that it's not much and is unlikely to be needed, considering the game is almost dead, but still,
if you played the previous parts of this game, you probably won't like this one due to its short length and the small limit on infantry and building production. Still, if you decide to buy it, only at a discount, because it's really expensive."

The gameplay is just... bad... it's very poorly balanced. Since there are no more harvests, at times, the mission boils down to either destroying everything with the small base composition you made with your points because the repairs can be very high with just 2 or 3 repairers... or it boils down to spamming units that are going to slaughter because the AI ​​throws a lot of troops at you.

The game is very short compared to the number of missions we're used to with other C&Cs. A total of 3 GDI missions to start the tutorial shared by both factions, and then 7 missions for each faction...

In short, a disgrace, nothing more, nothing less. I only finished it to see the end of the saga... and again, it's disappointing. The ending is really rushed... My god, what a lousy conclusion to a saga as epic as this one."

Возможно, будь данная прекраснейшая ""четвертая"" часть, не ""четвертой"" для легендарной серии C&C, а первой для какой-нибудь новой вселенной, ВОЗМОЖНО (но это не точно), было бы хоть немного понятно почему всё так плохо (первый блин комом и все дела).

Игра совершенно не пригодна для мультиплеера и сражений с ботами, да и впринципе какого-либо вида соревнований между игроками. Она, скорее, заточена под ""Пройди сюжет и забудь что ты это проходил"", хотя и сам сюжет какой-то рвано-рашно-непонятный. Всё происходит очень быстро, то мы тут, то мы уже там, то всё плохо, то вроде бы жить можно, то Кейн хороший, то плохой...
Уже не говоря о том, что совершенно не рассказывается что же произошло и почему Братство обозлилось на Кейна и почему вдруг Кейн решил отдать Тацит ГСБшникам и вообще как он вышел на сотрудничество с ними. Огромная дыра в сюжете с момента окончания 3-ей и до начала 4-ой части.
[hr][/hr]
Говоря же про сам ГЕЙмплей. Моей любимой частью серии является C&C 3: KW и, думаю, все кто играл в неё и в своё время решили попробовать сей продукт, почувствовали ужасную пустоту внутри, а именно:

* Скринов нет от слова совсем, только ГСБ и НОД (в сравнении с 9 фракциями (3 основные +2 подфракции для каждой) в KW);

* Строительства базы нет - один краулер (типа МСЦ) и тот по сути даже  и не постройка. Их 3 вида, что тоже немного угнетает. Хочешь играть от авиации - вот тебе краулер под это, но нормальные наземки сделать не сможешь. И впринципе это разделение ролей на Танк, Саппорт и ДД убивает какое-либо желание относить эту игру к стратегии. Добро пожаловать в RTS версию Team Fortress, Господа (ну или Overwatch, отзыв всё же в 2022 пишется);

* Экономика, которая в мультиплеере всегда являлась основной целью и по сути побеждал тот, кто лучше построит свою и испортит вражескую? Не - держите кристальчик тиберия, который надо кое-как доставить на спавн, чтобы вкачать свой краулер, чтобы делать войска посильнее и прокачивать те что уже есть.

* Динамика боя? Попытки скрытно подлезть и что-то сделать? Да, как бы, никто не запрещает, но зачем? Захват точек зависит от войск внутри зоны, а не от того, у кого там жива турелька на спавне;
Да и сама механика захвата точек. Я блин играю в Battlefield или в RTS? Моей целью должно быть уничтожение вражеских сил, а не захват и удержание каких-то непонятных точек, особо даже не понятно зачем. Я был бы совершенно не против, будь это частью геймплея, аля ""Будешь держать эти точки - будет тебе преимущество"", т.е. чтобы это было компонентом (как те же Тибериевые Вышки (спайки) в третьей части или Центр управления ЭМИ) для достижения какой-то более крупной цели, а не самоцелью боя;

* Разные стили игры? Макро и Микро? Не, не слышали. Ты можешь быть бесконечно крутым игроком в макро, но какой в этом смысл, если у тебя лимит на юниты? Поспамить не выйдет - да, отчасти это добавляет ""тактики"" в игру - нельзя втупую наспамить юнитов и громить все подряд, это бесспорно плюс такого решения, но, при этом, если мы говорим про чуть более высокий уровень игры, чем совсем нубский, даже при игре от спама, без микроконтроля и тактики ты не выиграешь, а получается мы ""победили"" проблему которой, собственно, и не было, а только лишь ограничили свободу действий игрока, потому что ему, чтобы ""законтрить"" бюлд врага, надо буквально отправить свои войска на фарш, чтобы тебе дало сделать новые.
Сама механика ""контра"" войск тоже сделана прям максимально не комфортно и не понятно на что расчитана. Было всё просто: есть пехота, техника, авиация и постройки. Вот тебе для каждого из этих видов юниты, которые эффективны против них, причем, было достаточно очевидно, кто против кого (пули - пехота, ракеты - техника и авиация, гранаты/огонь - постройки) и отсутствие каких-либо ограничений позволяло быстро отреагировать на то или иное решение противника. 
Сейчас же: легкая, средняя, тяжелая броня и ты смотришь на юнит и не понимаешь кто против него эффективен. Как по мне довольно смешно, когда танк с двумя огромными пулеметами буквально щекочет пехоту врага, потому что у них броня не того типа, против которого пули эффективны - да, можно привыкнуть и придр**читься, но это усложняет и запутывает то, что, как раз таки, лучше оставить максимально простым и интуитивно понятным, дабы в бою ты был сконцентрирован на более важных вещах с точки зрения тактики;

* Опять же, до жути не хватает разнообразия самих юнитов. Если в старой части 9 фракций имели достаточно неплохой набор каждого из типов юнитов (хотя, конечно, кто-то скажет что в сравнении с другими стратегиями их было мало, но лично я считаю, что ""больше"" не значит ""лучше"", особенно для RTS - их было ровно столько, сколько ""достаточно""), то в этой части, мало того, что по сути мы, в основном, получили перерисованные модельки тех же самых с точки зрения механик юнитов, так ещё и без особого их разнообразия. И вот здесь действительно чувствуется отсутствие третьей стороны конфликта в виде пришельцев, слишком однотипными получаются бои, ОСОБЕННО если учесть, что теперь нельзя воевать например НОД vs НОД, каждый матч - это НОД vs ГСБ, что окончательно добивает малейшие надежды на разнообразие.

* Самое ужасное - прокачка. Если в старых частях прокачка отсутствовала и механика блокировки юнитов была только в Кампании и сделана была лишь для того, чтобы преподносить сюжет корректно и ты не громил первые миссии тир 3 войсками, то в этой части, даже для мультиплеера и сражений, тебе необходимо получать уровень, который открывает тебе юниты. Т.е., говоря простым языком: хочешь пойти поиграть против других людей - сначала часов эдак очень много погоняй ботов, чтобы получить ранг, кстати, для НОД и ГСБ он отдельный, т.е. получаем в сумме (эдак очень много)х2 гоняний ботов. Причем, когда ты получаешь ранг, тебе эти юниты становятся доступны и в кампании, что превращает изначально достаточно не простые миссии, в легкую прогулку, если ты достиг максимального уровня. Данную механику я совершенно так и не понял зачем вообще было вводить, ведь эти ранги абсолютно не отражают насколько ты опытен в этой игре, а лишь делают твой ""старт"" в ней более болезненным и долгим, с одной стороны да, продлевая игровые часы в ней, но с другой, эти часы удовольствием явно не наполнены.

* А ещё, запустив сие чудо вновь и буквально зайдя в сражение с ботами, я осознал насколько здесь ужасный интерфейс. Он огромен и занимает почти весь экран (при разрешении 1920х1080 на минуточку), куча кнопок разбросано по разным углам, причем эти кнопки можно было сделать маленькими, либо вообще вынести в хот-кеи и не занимать мой экран ими...

В общем, подытоживая, хотелось бы верить, что разработчики никогда не займутся ремастером этого ""шедевра"", а если и займутся, то скорее сделают из него совершенно другую игру, действительно достойную звания 4 части культовой серии.","[b]An excellent game[/b], demonstrating how not to do things.

Perhaps if this wonderful ""fourth"" part were not the ""fourth"" for the legendary C&C series, but the first for some new universe, MAYBE (but I'm not sure), it would be at least a little clearer why everything is so bad (the first pancake is always a flop, and all that).

The game is completely unsuitable for multiplayer, bot battles, or any kind of competition between players. It's more geared toward ""Complete the story and forget you even played it,"" even though the story itself is disjointed and incomprehensible. Everything happens so fast: one moment we're here, the next we're gone, one moment everything's bad, the next it's ok, Kane is good, the next he's bad...

Not to mention the complete lack of explanation of what happened, why the Brotherhood got mad at Kane, why Kane suddenly decided to hand the Tacitus over to GDI, and how he even ended up collaborating with them. There's a huge plot hole from the end of Part 3 to the beginning of Part 4.
[hr][/hr]
Speaking of the GAMEPLAY itself. My favorite part of the series is C&C 3: KW, and I think everyone who played it and decided to try this game felt a terrible emptiness inside, namely:

* There are absolutely no screenshots, only GDI and Nod (compared to 9 factions (3 main + 2 subfactions for each) in KW);

* There's no base building—just one crawler (like the MSC), and that's not really even a building. There are three types, which is a bit depressing. If you want to play with air power, there's a crawler for that, but you can't build decent ground forces. And basically, this division of roles into Tank, Support, and Damage Dealer kills any desire to consider this game a strategy game. Welcome to the RTS version of Team Fortress, gentlemen (or Overwatch, I'm writing this review in 2022, after all);

* The economy, which in multiplayer has always been the main goal, and the winner is essentially whoever builds their own better and ruins the enemy's? No—here's a Tiberium crystal that needs to be hauled to spawn to upgrade your crawler, make your troops stronger, and upgrade the ones you already have.

* Combat dynamics? Attempts to sneak up and do something? Yeah, no one's stopping me, but why? Capturing points depends on the troops inside the zone, not on whoever has a live turret at spawn.
And the point-capture mechanics themselves. Am I playing Battlefield or an RTS? My goal should be to destroy enemy forces, not capture and hold some obscure points, and I don't even really understand why. I wouldn't be against it at all if it were part of the gameplay, like ""Hold these points and you'll have an advantage,"" i.e., if it were a component (like the Tiberium Spikes in the third game or the EMP Control Center) to achieve some larger goal, not the end of the battle itself.

* Different playstyles? Macro and Micro? No, never heard of them. You can be an infinitely skilled macro player, but what's the point if you have a unit limit? Spamming isn't an option—yes, it adds some ""tactics"" to the game—you can't just spam units and smash everything, which is definitely a plus. However, if we're talking about a slightly higher level of play than a complete noob, even spamming, without micromanagement and tactics, you won't win. So, we've ""solved"" a problem that didn't actually exist, but merely limited the player's freedom of action. To counter an enemy's unit, they have to literally send their troops to the dogs, allowing you to create new ones.
The counter-troop mechanics themselves are also extremely awkward and unclear. Everything used to be simple: there were infantry, vehicles, aircraft, and buildings. Here you have units for each of these types that are effective against them, and it was fairly obvious who was against whom (bullets - infantry, missiles - vehicles and aircraft, grenades/fire - buildings), and the lack of any restrictions allowed you to quickly respond to any enemy decision.

Now: light, medium, heavy armor, and you look at a unit and have no idea which is effective against it. I find it rather funny when a tank with two huge machine guns literally tickles enemy infantry because their armor isn't the type that bullets are effective against. Yes, you can get used to it and become picky, but it complicates and confuses what is best left as simple and intuitive as possible, so that in battle you can focus on more important tactical matters.

* Again, the lack of variety in the units themselves is terribly lacking. While in the old game, the 9 factions had a fairly decent selection of each unit type (although, of course, some might say they were underpowered compared to other strategy games, but I personally believe that ""more"" doesn't mean ""better,"" especially for an RTS—there were just enough). In this game, not only are we essentially getting redesigned models of the same units in terms of mechanics, but there's also little variety. And here, the lack of a third side in the conflict in the form of aliens is truly noticeable; battles become too repetitive, ESPECIALLY considering that you can't now fight, for example, Nod vs. Nod; every match is Nod vs. GDI, which completely destroys any hope of variety.

* The worst part is the leveling. While the older games lacked leveling and the unit locking mechanic was only present in the Campaign, designed solely to convey the storyline correctly and prevent you from crushing the first missions with Tier 3 troops, in this game, even for multiplayer and battles, you need to level up to unlock units. Simply put, if you want to play against other players, you first have to spend a lot of hours chasing bots to gain a rank. Incidentally, there's a separate rank for Nod and GDI, meaning you get a total of (likely a lot) x2 bot chasing. Moreover, once you reach a rank, these units become available to you in the campaign, which turns what were initially quite challenging missions into a breeze once you've reached the maximum level. I still don't understand why this mechanic was even introduced, as these ranks don't reflect your experience in this game at all. They only make your ""start"" more painful and time-consuming. While this extends the gameplay, it's clearly not enjoyable.

* Also, after launching this marvel again and literally jumping into a battle with bots, I realized how terrible the interface is. It's huge, taking up almost the entire screen (at a resolution of 1920x1080, mind you), with tons of buttons scattered all over the place, even though these buttons could have been made smaller, or even placed in hotkeys so they wouldn't take up my screen...

In short, I'd like to believe the developers will never remaster this ""masterpiece,"" and if they do, they'll likely make it into a completely different game, truly worthy of being the fourth installment in this iconic series."

""Twilight? More like Twi-shite!""

---

I remember playing this game when it first came out. I first started playing games from the C&C franchise with Tiberium Wars, and from that day, bought every single one the day it came out. I decided to rebuy Twilight on Steam because I'd since lost the DVD and thought ""maybes its not as bad as I remember"". Wow, that was incorrect.

The game-play is shoddy, and a complete departure from previous C&C games (change isn't a bad thing, but EA made some pretty horrendous changes to the format). The soundtrack is completely unmemorable, and completely lacking in any memorable tracks! Its just got no spirit.

Now, let's talk about a stable of the C&C franchise; the hammy F.M.V. cut-scenes. Well they are certainly hammy, but you can really tell that literally nobody is enjoying the scripts they've been handed - in fact, I'm shocked Joe Kucan didn't walk off set demanding a better set of lines... which leads me onto a bigger issue. The story!

The story has got to be the most boring, lazy waste of space in the history of the franchise, and that's really saying something, since Generals and Zero Hour were just a generic war thriller. What I will say, is that at least those two games had functional stories; 'Twilight' plops you into GDI command and introduces you to your character's wife who does nothing except cry and get sentimental. Its like the writers clearly want you to care about her, but they give you no reason. You feel absolutely no sympathy for her - I thought it was just my issue cause she's not my type, because I'm as gay as a bloody West End musical! But most people seem to hate her character.

Do I recommend this game? No, not even to the hardcore fans of the franchise. I mean if you're really, genuinely curious then feel free to watch a YouTube play-through because its not worth wasting your hard earned cash.","Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight' ~ 2/10

Instead of a regular base you get choice between the three walking tanks - crawlers, that can produce units, build defenses or call up support abilities, like bombing the area or laying down mines. While the concept might sound fun on paper and there are a lot of games built around similar ideas, the game pulls it off completely wrong. Now that your base is walking around the map, there’s no need to collect resources, so you can build whenever you want, but your maximum number of units is limited. This makes the campaign so much harder, because your enemies usually have multiple crawlers and so the bigger unit limit. At times I felt like I was deadlocked into a stalemate, because the enemy produced units at the same time as I destroyed them. However, the stupidness of the AI helps very much in such cases. If you focus your fire on the enemy base, AI will not notice it most of the time and will keep destroying your units, but you can keep replacing them almost at the same rate as they can.

I won’t go into story details here, first of all because it requires at least some knowledge of previous games. Second of all, it’s so bland and generic in this game, that you will probably forget it as soon as you close the game. The graphics look ok, doesn’t feel like they’ve changed much since previous game and it still has a 30 FPS lock, that no one in the modding community bothered to remove, so you’ll be stuck with that if you decide to play it. The FMV cutscenes have changed for the worse, it feels like they cut the budget in half. The original costumes are gone, now soldiers wear the same outfits as in our world, other characters wear plain clothes. A quick reminder that the game takes place in the year 2077 and the cities in the video reports they show you throughout the game look the same as in 2010.

现在Steam商店页面甚至把多人联机标签撕了，那看来EA算是主动放弃售卖了。如果EA就是这种态度的话，我建议TTF的下架麻烦也搞快点。

12.02更新:TTF真下架了？那没事了。","After 11 years, this game has finally been removed from the shelves.

Forget the quality issues themselves. What was the state of the game before it was removed? Servers frequently crashed. Posting to the EA forums to inquire about it, the community managers were either completely clueless or offered useless ""solutions.""

This removal means that players' unit unlock progress and battle records will be lost. More importantly, since the single-player campaign requires a full internet connection to save, even if the story campaign is abysmally awful, it will be impossible to experience this storyline in the CNC Tiberium series through legitimate channels. The series is being presented as a purely online game, and its unreliability speaks for itself.

Now that the Steam store page has even removed the multiplayer tab, it seems EA has voluntarily given up on selling it. If this is EA's attitude, I suggest that TTF's removal be handled swiftly.

12.02 Update: Is TTF really removed? That's all fine."

​Je savais que ce dernier command and conquer n'était pas fort brillant. Mais, je me devais de le jouer, juste pour l'histoire et revoir le célèbre Kane une dernière fois...

Ça fait longtemps que j'y ai joué, mais, il est tellement présent dans ma mémoire que je me dois d'en faire un commentaire ! 

Ceci est probablement l'un.... si non, le PIRE exemple de la fausse ""bonne idée"" dans l'histoire du jeu video!

A la place d'une base, on a un constructeur mobile.

Le jeu se distingue par un côté pierre/papier/ciseaux prononcé. Qui peut avoir de bons côté, mais est totalement ridicule par moment. Ou des véhicules antichar avec quasi aucun blindage sont capables de résister à des obus en pleine face sans problème.

Bref, un constructeur mobile en tant qu'unique base, et on gagne en multi avec des points de capture, parce qu'on n'a pas de resources à gérer.

C'était sûrement pour rendre le jeu plus nerveux et révolutionner le RTS ???
Non ??? Je pari que c'est EA qui voulait investir le minimum possible. Pas de base, pas d'équilibrage à prévoir. Et jeu accessible à plus grand nombre (les non joueurs de RTS).

Sérieusement, pas de base à construire et à GÉRER ? Ceci est la pire idée qu'ils pouvaient avoir.
Resultat, on vadrouille dans la map à l'aveugle, pour capturer des points de contrôle et éviter si possible d'exposer son seul QG.
En plus, si l'ennemi a construit un build ""contre"" le votre, l'effet pierre/papier/ciseaux très prononcé fait que vous ne pouvez tout simplement pas gagner. On sélectionne toute des unités et les supprime lol. Pour construire un nouveau build. Oui, parce qu'il n'a pas de ressources, juste des points de population. Vous pouvez vous débarrasser de vos unités sans remors.

Les unités aérienne sont OP. Et le QG volant l'est tout autant. Il permet d'éviter indéfiniment les ennemis. Ce qui vous permet jouer au petit parasite toute la partie ! Yay ! Le plaisir !... (oui l'équilibrage de ce jeu est horrible)

Même si on joue la campagne, il faut grinder de l'XP pour déverrouiller des unités. Vous obligeant à rejouer des maps solo. Comme si le jeu n'était pas assez mauvais et inintéressant comme ça...

Le multi était mort dès la première semaine.

Enfin, parlons de l'histoire. Sans grand intérêt, voire stupide. Triste final...
Petit spoil :
Kane utilise le portail alien du 3eme volet pour partir définitivement. Fin, et point final à la saga. Tout ce que vous accomplissez au cours de l'histoire ne sert pas à grand chose. Vous avez servi de garde du corps à Kane et vous activez le portail.
Argggggg ! Et ils sont où les aliens ?

Graphiquement c'est... Euh... Pareil que le 3 ? En moins détaillé ???

Bref ""press F"" pour cette franchise, honteusement humilié et massacrée dans ce C&C 4.
Je pense sur c'est le pire jeu, de ma bibliothèque Steam........ Rien que ça....
Et c'est 20 euros! Vraiment ? A ce prix on a des alternatives bien... Bien... Bien meilleures.

Par conte, je vous conseille sans hésitation le C&C remarsterd. Aussi bien que l'original, avec les cinématiques d'optimisées pour les résolutions actuelles. Le gamplay est veuillo mais toujours excellent,  particulièrement pour un nostalgique qui y a joué à l'époque comme moi 😄
Ne prenez pas le 4, l'une des pires déception de l'histoire. Sa note steam est amplement merité.","I'm a fan of C&C from the very beginning. Yes, I played the very first one in 1995. It was a revolutionary game in its time. The FMV, the iconic music, the intuitive design... the cutscenes were magnificent.
​I knew this latest Command & Conquer wasn't very brilliant. But I had to play it, just for the story and to see the famous Kane one last time...

It's been a long time since I played it, but it's so vivid in my memory that I have to write a review!

This is probably one... if not the WORST example of a false ""good idea"" in the history of video games!

Instead of a base, we have a mobile constructor.

The game is distinguished by a pronounced rock/paper/scissors aspect. Which can have its good points, but is totally ridiculous at times. Or anti-tank vehicles with almost no armor are able to withstand shells directly in the face without any problem.

In short, a mobile builder as your only base, and you win in multiplayer with capture points, because you don't have to manage resources.

Surely this was to make the game more responsive and revolutionize RTS?
No? I bet EA wanted to invest as little as possible. No base, no balancing required. And the game is accessible to a wider audience (non-RTS players).

Seriously, no base to build and MANAGE? This is the worst idea they could have had.
As a result, you wander around the map blindly, capturing control points and, if possible, avoiding exposing your only HQ.

What's more, if the enemy has built a build ""against"" yours, the very pronounced rock/paper/scissors effect means you simply can't win. We select all the units and delete them, lol. To build a new build. Yes, because it has no resources, only population points. You can get rid of your units without remorse.

The air units are OP. And so is the flying HQ. It allows you to avoid enemies indefinitely. Which allows you to play the little parasite for the entire game! Yay! The fun!... (yes, the balancing in this game is horrible)

Even if you play the campaign, you have to grind XP to unlock units. Forcing you to replay single-player maps. As if the game wasn't bad and uninteresting enough as it was...

The multiplayer was dead in the first week.

Finally, let's talk about the story. Not very interesting, even stupid. Sad ending...
Small spoiler:
Kane uses the alien portal from the third installment to leave for good. The end, and full stop, to the saga. Everything you accomplish throughout the story is of little use. You served as Kane's bodyguard and you activate the portal.
Arggggggg! And where are the aliens?

Graphically, it's... Uh... Same as the 3rd? Only less detailed???

In short, ""F"" for this franchise, shamefully humiliated and massacred in this C&C 4.
I think it's the worst game in my Steam library........ Just that...
And it's 20 euros! Really? At that price, we have much... much... much better alternatives.

However, I unhesitatingly recommend the C&C Remastered. As good as the original, with the cutscenes optimized for current resolutions. The gameplay is shabby but still excellent, especially for a nostalgic who played it back in the day like me 😄

The mechanics are incredibly stupid; it's not even a strategy, it's some kind of gypsy circus! You just wander around with your base (which is the only building in the game, aside from two cannons and bunkers if you choose the defense module).
There are no decent resources, no familiar buildings. At least nothing is familiar! This isn't C&C. Maybe someone as old as me remembers Strategy Z on the PS1. It's the same, but the maps are much smaller.
The campaign, when played, gives you a complete shambles after the 3rd or 4th mission. It's almost impossible to complete without skill upgrades, and skill upgrades are achieved either by playing the campaign or through long battles in Skirmish mode.
Skirmish mode is a complete bummer. You can't choose a side—it's like GDI, and you can't even stand a chance. Apparently, the ability to play as Nod needs to be unlocked somehow, but damn, this skirmish mode is a lousy one! It's always been like this: choose a map, starting conditions, opponents/allies, and off you go.

-Como C&C es malo, como juego de estrategia también. Y digo ""estrategia"" por decir algo, porque es casi nula. Cada pantalla se basa en un ""toma y daca"" entre tú y la cpu ""defecando"" unidades infinitas sin parar hasta que una aplasta a la otra.

-La historia es la peor de la saga, ya no solo por el sinsentido del argumento si no por lo pésimamente malos que son todos los actores de los vídeos, ni el propio Kane se salva, es su peor papel de lejos. 2 campañas, una larga y la de NOD cortisima que parece un ""pegote"" puesto de relleno y ambas con el mismo final.....

-Tiene ideas que podrían haber sido medio buenas pero si se hubiese planteado de otra forma, lo único salvable es el uso del motor gráfico de Red Alert 3, que este último sin ser perfecto ni mucho menos es bastante mejor juego y más disfrutable.

+Resumiendo: Solo puede interesar a alguien que quiera terminar la saga y saber como se cierra la historia, dejandole el sabor agridulce de lo que podía haber sido y lo que nos han dado. Una lástima ver como esta gran franquicia acabó así de mal.","Weighing the good and the bad, unfortunately, the BAD outweighs the bad.

- As a strategy game, it's bad, and as a strategy game, it's bad too. And I say ""strategy"" for the sake of it, because it's almost nonexistent. Each screen is based on a back-and-forth between you and the CPU, endlessly ""defecating"" units until one crushes the other.

- The story is the worst in the series, not only because of the nonsense of the plot but also because of how awfully bad all the actors in the videos are. Not even Kane himself is spared; it's his worst role by far. Two campaigns, one long and the very short NOD one that feels like a ""sticky"" filler, and both with the same ending...

- It has ideas that could have been halfway good, but if it had been presented differently, the only redeeming feature is the use of the Red Alert 3 graphics engine. The latter, while not perfect by any means, is a much better and more enjoyable game.

+In short: It's only interesting to someone who wants to finish the saga and find out how the story concludes, leaving them with the bittersweet taste of what could have been and what we've been given. It's a shame to see this great franchise end so badly."

-Te pide iniciar sesión 2 veces en EA, caso contrario no podrás jugar
-El serial puede no funcionarte y hasta podrías tener que instalar Origin para correrlo
-Ya no se arman bases, cosecha tiberio ni existen las bombas nucleares ni cañón de iones
-Ahora cada unidad tiene un tipo de arma y blindaje: si no dispones del arma adecuada para destruir a cierto blindaje, casi que no podrás destruirla (por ej. destruir Mammoths con lásers)
-Las unidades son gratis, se construyen rápido y son limitadas: ahora existe un sistema de puntos parecida a la comida en Warcraft III. Esto provoca que entres en un loop contra el rival donde cada unidad destruida instantáneamente es reemplazada
-Todo se hace desde un Crawler, una base móvil que cae del cielo (literal)
-La campaña tiene 7 misiones por facción y se terminan en 5 horas
-Los Scrin nunca volvieron a pisar la Tierra, a pesar de haber prometido una invasión total
-El hilo argumental no sigue para nada C&C3 ni KW, todo el ejército cyborg de Legión prácticamente no existe
-Su apartado gráfico es inferior a su precuela, con un tono ligeramente caricaturesco
-El diseño de los vehículos es demasiado genérico, casi que no existen unidades míticas de toda la saga más que el Mammoth tank, la nave Venom y la moto de ataque
-Al no haber base, la condición de victoria se reduce a capturar nodos de tiberio, algo así como construir maravillas en Age of Empires pero más aburrido todavía

Pros:","Cons:
-It asks you to log in to EA twice, otherwise you won't be able to play.
-The serial may not work, and you might even have to install Origin to run it.
-You no longer build bases, harvest tiberium, or use nuclear bombs or ion cannons.
-Each unit now has a weapon and armor type: if you don't have the right weapon to destroy a certain armor, you'll almost never be able to destroy it (e.g., destroying Mammoths with lasers).
-Units are free, build quickly, and are limited. There's now a point system similar to food in Warcraft III. This forces you into a loop against your opponent where every destroyed unit is instantly replaced.
-Everything is done from a Crawler, a mobile base that literally falls from the sky.
-The campaign has 7 missions per faction and is completed in 5 hours.
-The Scrin never set foot on Earth again, despite having promised a full-scale invasion.
-The plot doesn't follow C&C3 or KW at all; the entire cyborg army of Legion is practically nonexistent.
-Its graphics are inferior to its prequel, with a slightly cartoonish tone.
-The vehicle design is too generic; there are almost no iconic units from the entire saga other than the Mammoth Tank, the Venom Ship, and the Attack Bike.
-Since there's no base, the victory condition is reduced to capturing tiberium nodes, a bit like building wonders in Age of Empires, but even more boring.

取而代之的是3种不同功能的移动MCV；双方共同被限制的单位人口；以及地图上固定时段刷出的升级资源……
基于种种改变，游戏的玩法也发生了巨大的变化。在本作中则更注重于不同MCV的功能与机动[spoiler]（因为其灵活性差与体型庞大，被称为“王八”也不足为奇）[/spoiler]，并且玩家也需要在人口资源的限制之下决定在不同的时段应该怎样分配单位的生产与作战时的组合，再者就是该怎么利用手上现有的力量来完成升级资源的抢夺或者是达成任务目标等等目的。
由此可见，这一作更注重的是单位与功能的组合与资源分配，并且也大大提升了其网游化的程度，更推崇玩家之间的合作与对抗，尤其在团队对抗时，不同玩家选择不同的MCV也会有不同的分工与搭配，使得游戏性有了质的飞跃。
但是从反向来看，这样的改变也是带来了很多不利因素。头一个就是老派的CNC玩家可不一定认账，从内容上看则是有太多的简化，而且玩法上的差异也并不会让人立马适应而觉得玩起来会很舒服。而且地图的设计也变得更加死板，几乎是清一色的竞技向地图，大大减少初始站位的偶然性，使得其过度电竞化。最大诟病的因素之一就是糟糕的人口限制，虽说在一定程度上抑制了人海堆兵，但也减少了单位组合多样化的可能性，降低了战术尝试过程中带来的容错率。
总的来说，针对如果真的是找不来朋友，或者不能快速适应新模式的玩家来说，这一系列的改动则是失败的。
[h1]【旧碗装新饭】[/h1]
一个[b]“4”[/b]字[spoiler]（宣传视频甚至还给了特写）[/spoiler]可以说是正传的正统延续，但制作组却并没有因此去使用新的引擎，而是沿用了CNC3的老引擎来制作CNC4，所以不论是在界面操作，以及游戏内的操作都透漏着一种没什么进步的感觉，甚至会让玩家觉得这是用旧的东西改出来大型官方模组。一度还夹杂着赶工与减料的嫌疑。
[h1]【平淡却不得不叙说的故事】[/h1]
作为最终章来说，故事内容是合格的，最大的缺点就是短小急促。但因CNC3和《凯恩之怒》的素质就已经摆在那里，所以本作作为最终章能做到这个程度也是实属不易。演员的演技似乎只有凯恩和妻子在线，其他演员略微有些尬演，而GDI司令弄一个黑人大妈来扮演多少有点zzzq的味道，而且整体看来显得相当违和。拍摄布景虽然显得简略，但表演者的镜头感则是相当的不错，也算是对此有另一方面的弥补。
故事依然是GDI 和NOD之间的对抗，但随着全球环境的恶化，人们也不得不在不同的理念中做出抉择。而主角“指挥官”就是其中重要的一位。他曾解救GDI的上司与其一同起义来阻止敌人的野心；也曾为NOD铲除叛党替身凯恩实现升天大计。终于信徒们去往新的世界，而地球也结束了战乱的循环。
如果说伴随着长达15年的陪伴最终要以这一作来画上句号，那应该就是在升天传送门打开时，凯恩对玩家说的那句包含了诸多意义的：
[b]“谢谢你”[/b]。
[h1]不想完全压死这个游戏，只能说：[/h1]
[h1]好玩，但并不耐玩[/h1]

你的支持将会是我们不竭的动力！[/quote]","Since its 1995 debut, the Command & Conquer series has reached its final twilight.

It's a shame there's no ""recommended"" or ""not recommended"" rating. The game isn't particularly bad, but it's been left in a state of near-death.

""Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight"" can be considered a bold and innovative transformation of the series. It breaks through traditional RTS gameplay and shatters the traditional C&C model. However, change is always accompanied by pain and doubt, especially with the weighty yet glorious title of ""Command & Conquer.""

[The Pros and Cons of ""The Battle of the Turtle""]

This is where the huge changes lie. Gone is the satisfaction of expanding bases and buildings from previous games; gone is the thrill of overwhelmingly amassing troops in a given period; and gone is the excitement of building super units and weapons...
Instead, there are three mobile MCVs with different functions; a population limit shared by both sides; and upgrade resources that spawn on the map at fixed times...
With all these changes, the gameplay has undergone a significant transformation. This game places greater emphasis on the functions and maneuverability of different MCVs [spoiler] (given their limited mobility and large size, it's no surprise they're called ""turtles"") [/spoiler] Players must decide how to allocate unit production and combat combinations at different times within population resource constraints, and how to utilize their existing forces to seize upgrade resources or achieve mission objectives.

This clearly demonstrates a greater emphasis on unit and function combinations and resource allocation in this game, significantly enhancing its online gameplay and fostering greater cooperation and competition between players. Especially in team battles, different players' choice of MCVs allows for different divisions of labor and teamwork, resulting in a substantial leap in gameplay. However, from a different perspective, these changes also bring a number of disadvantages. The first is that old-school CNC players may not appreciate them. The content is overly simplified, and the gameplay differences don't make it easy to adapt and feel comfortable. Furthermore, map design has become more rigid, almost exclusively competitive, significantly reducing the chance of initial positioning and making it overly esports-oriented. One of the biggest criticisms is the poor population limit. While it somewhat inhibits large-scale troop build-ups, it also reduces the potential for diverse unit combinations and reduces the margin for error when experimenting with strategies.
Overall, for players who struggle to find friends or adapt quickly to the new mode, these changes are a failure. [h1][New Rice in an Old Bowl][/h1]
The number [b]4[/b] [spoiler] (the promotional video even gives it a close-up)[/spoiler] could be considered a legitimate continuation of the original series, but the development team didn't adopt a new engine, instead using the old CNC3 engine for CNC4. As a result, both the interface and in-game controls feel largely unchanged, even leading players to believe it's a large-scale official mod repurposed from outdated software. There's even a tinge of rushing and cutting corners.
[h1][A Plain, But Unavoidable Story][/h1]
For a final chapter, the story is passable, its biggest drawback being its brevity and rushing. However, given the quality of CNC3 and Kane's Wrath, achieving this level of performance is truly remarkable for a final chapter. The acting seems to be limited to Kane and his wife; the others' performances are a bit awkward, and the casting of a middle-aged woman as the GDI commander is a bit jarring, and the overall effect is rather awkward. While the filming sets appear sparse, the actors' camerawork is quite impressive, compensating for the lack of context.
The story continues with the conflict between GDI and NOD, but as the global environment deteriorates, people are forced to choose between differing philosophies. The protagonist, ""The Commander,"" is a crucial figure in this conflict. He rescued his GDI superiors and joined them in an uprising to thwart the enemy's ambitions; he also helped NOD eliminate the traitorous double, Kane, and realize their Ascension plan. Finally, the believers journeyed to a new world, and Earth's cycle of war ended.
If this game is the final culmination of 15 years of companionship, it would be Kane's words to the player as the Ascension portal opens, which are filled with so much meaning:
[b]""Thank you""[/b]
[h1]I don't want to completely criticize this game, but I can only say:[/h1]
[h1]It's fun, but not very playable.[/h1]

[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/TITLEplayer/recommended/47700]──────────────────────[/url]
EA doubled down on DRM for this game. The first problem I encountered was logging in. When you buy this off Steam, you need to make sure you have an Origin account and register your new cd key on Origin. There are two logins in this game. When you start the game, you start the launcher first and it requires you to enter your Origin credentials. Now there’s another login screen in-game, you will enter the same credentials. HOWEVER, compared to the launcher’s login, if your password is MORE THAN 16 CHARACTERS the game will not log you in. The [b]in-game password field cannot go past 16 characters.[/b] I had to shorten my password, making my account less secure. Now, this game has another problem and it’s a major one.

It appears that the multiplayer features of the game are locked; the servers supporting the multiplayer must have shut down. Attempts to host a lobby will give you an error. [b]There’s no way to know if auto-matching works, but it’s safe to say that all three multiplayer features--lobby hosting, co-op campaign, and auto-matching--do no longer work.[/b]

The only features you have access in this game is the campaign and skirmish against computer AIs. And who knows when this game’s remaining servers, for logging users in, will shut down.

So, if you’re interested in only playing Command and Conquer 4’s story campaign, I recommend you buy it when it is heavily discounted. I got this for $5.

[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/TITLEplayer/recommended/47700]─────────────[/url]
Electronic Arts double downed on DRM for this game, making it always online. Prior to this game’s release, the publisher killed some interesting projects for the franchise. They shutdown Tiberium, a squad-based shooter that takes place after Tiberium Wars that looks like Halo and is a spiritual successor to C&C Renegade. They shut down a sequel to Generals that had a story that sounded similar to Homefront games. Command & Conquer 4’s Tiberium Twilight started its life as an MMO which explains why there is a class and leveling system. The game was forced to be salvaged into a triple AAA rts game, retaining many gameplay mechanics that fans definitely would dislike. Furthermore, they forced the franchise's future games to be browser and mobile games. They killed Generals 2, which is trying to return to its RTS roots.

So I usually supersample the older games I play. Playing on 4k resolution in C&C4 in 1080p monitor is fine. The game looks a little better and sharper, but the cursor does not scale up. It's incredibly tiny, so it's hard to select buttons or icons.

[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/TITLEplayer/recommended/47700]──────────[/url]
So this is a review of the current state of the game, meaning it will keep in mind that the multiplayer features are unavailable. Out of all the command and conquer games, this one has the worst story and campaigns. It is also very short. The GDI campaign is the worst one, and doesn't really explain the little details that's going on in the story. That's left to the NOD campaign, but is a bit better. Few of the Normal missions are hard to complete because your arsenal will be incomplete, your profile is under-leveled, and you can't play coop with another. You will have to play the campaign twice if you want to complete your arsenal. By then, it would be fun to play the campaign on the hardest difficulty with your full arsenal, but would it be worth the replay though?

This game reminds me of End of Nations and feels like a real slim down version of Red Alert 3. Even some of the unit designs feel as silly as the Red Alert 3's. Take, for example, the scorpion tank between C&C 3 Tiberium Wars and C&C4. In the previous game, it's sleek and looks like it's designed to be fast. In C&C4, it just looks more like a robotic scorpion. Or GDI's wolf tank looks like a little brother of the apocalypse tank.

The crawler system is interesting. You are given three types: offense, defense, and support. It makes the game almost feels like a moba and a beginnings of a MMORTS. Some units would have one or two abilities. Unit commands are carried over from Red Alert 3 and C&C3 Tiberium Wars and this game emphasizes a bit more on micromanagement. Although, I found the max population to be low and wished it was a tad higher. To upgrade, you have to level up your profile and right now, the fastest way is probably through the campaign. In the game, you will need to use your engineers to collect Tiberium crystals to be able to do upgrades (once you unlocked them through leveling). Furthermore, there are buildings that serve as control points which can be captured by your surrounding units. These grant further defense or extend deployment/building area. It feels similar to Dawn of War 2 or Company of Heroes, but worse. The defense crawler will be the closest thing to base building. Support crawler is focused a lot of building aerial units and using support abilities. I think the game shines a bit when you're playing 5 vs 5 with the AI, so you can have different crawlers supporting each other with their different unit compositions. Too bad multiplayer doesn't work anymore.

So as a C&C game, it's the worse but it's better than the recent mobile/browser C&C games. As a RTS game, it's okay.","[b]You only buy this to play the story campaign & when it's discounted, more info below[/b]

Pour le reste, ça n'a RIEN A VOIR AVEC Command & Conquer. 
Pas de gestion de base, pas de gestion de ressources, et le nombre d'unité sur le terrain est limité à une petite dizaine. On ne dispose que d'un seul bâtiment orienté attaque, défense, ou soutien générant une gamme d'unités différentes. Du coup, impossible de les mixer pour adapter sa stratégie (dommage pour un RTS) comme par exemple des unités aériennes et de l'infanterie par ; Ou des tourelles (oui ça non plus) et des tanks... Absurde. 
Et ces limitations amènent au point négatif centrale selon moi, à savoir: les boucles de gameplay. 
Faire pencher la balance d'un côté ou de l'autre est devenu tellement fastidieux, que l'on se retrouve refaire cent fois les mêmes actions en espérant gagner un peu de terrain sans succès ... ... mais sans que l'adversaire ne parvienne non plus à nous battre ! Même avec les plus fortes unités! 
Tout est long, répétitif, et donc extrêment ENNUYEUX.
Et je ne parle pas de la difficulté à activer le jeu sur Steam à cause d'EA, ou encore de l'obligation d'être connecté pour jouer !
En bref, c'est un plantage totale de la part d'Electronic Arts pour un titre qui se voulait être le dernier d'une belle saga. 
ENORME déception, énorme gâchis.","The only strong point: the quality of the cutscenes, and finding Kane.
As for the rest, it has NOTHING TO DO WITH Command & Conquer.
No base management, no resource management, and the number of units on the field is limited to a dozen or so. There's only one building available, oriented toward attack, defense, or support, generating a range of different units. As a result, it's impossible to mix them to adapt your strategy (a shame for an RTS), such as air units and infantry; or turrets (yes, that one too) and tanks... Absurd.
And these limitations lead to the central negative point, in my opinion: the gameplay loops.
Tipping the scales one way or the other has become so tedious that you find yourself repeating the same actions a hundred times, hoping to gain a little ground without success... ...but without the enemy managing to beat you either! Even with the strongest units!
Everything is long, repetitive, and therefore extremely BORING.
And I'm not even talking about the difficulty activating the game on Steam because of EA, or the requirement to be logged in to play!
In short, it's a total failure on the part of Electronic Arts for a title that was supposed to be the last in a great series.
A HUGE disappointment, a huge waste."

It holds almost no connections to the original trilogy gameplay-wise and the overall plot isn't all that well supported. Now if you were looking to play this game without knowing what Command and Conquer is, then you might find some enjoyment in this game. It offers a sort of new concept of a moving base, and is very different from the base building RTS games that everyone is fond of. While the Unit Cap is quite annoying, it's understandable because for many people, commanding a limited amount of units while doing the same with the mobile base is easier than say, 200 units. 

There's a lot wrong with this game, one being that it was supposed to take the mantle of the Tiberium series, but failed catastrophically, and another being that there's many gameplay mechanics that are very dumb, like the unnecessary grind-y element of the game. Who would want to willingly grind out about 10 hours just to get the mastodon, or kodiak? They could have just restricted those unit access in the campaign, not in the Skirmishes. Or take the aformentioned unit cap; I said it was understandable, but that doesn't mean it was a very dumb thing to do. Most of the RTS players are perfectly fine with commanding a very large amount of units, that's the whole appeal of it.

With the story, I genuinely don't think it was alright. I will try not to spoil anything (though I doubt anyone would care even if I did,) but the way the campaign did the cutscenes, just no. I don't hate the actors that had to go through that, it's everything else about it; bland lines, decent-but-not-good enough emotion, the effects were alright, and definitely felt like it was made back in 2010. The story line did match up with the gameplay, but almost none of it made sense when you think about the other games in the franchise. There were plot holes like ""how did GDI magically find a way to fight back against the Tiberium spread?"" or ""For what reason did Kane show the Tacitus to GDI?"" that were never explained, even after pretty much a decade of radio silence. You should really not count this game as being canon to the story, sticking to C&C 3: Tiberium Wars is much better than this.

I played through the GDI campaign on a pirated copy. The story is mediocre, with both sides sharing similar stories. And the portal at the end looks like it was painted directly on the wall. It's so cheesy. To gain experience, you can play PvE 5v5. Four Cruel enemies on your side and two or three Cruel enemies on the other side. Just fight as hard as you can. We have more people, but the experience is a bit low. It takes three rounds to level up. Leveling up in the story is fast, but it's a bit difficult. If you can't beat it, try PvE to level up.
The early game is extremely painful, but the experience improves at higher levels. The units are pretty good, and it's okay to play for fun. Finally, don't buy it from Steam.

# 꿀잼 3가지
1. 전혀 다른 게임 시스템: 기존의 전략 시뮬이랑은 많이 다른 새로운 시스템
2. 캐주얼한 게임 플레이: 거기다 친절히 유닛 상성까지도 보여주어서 좋음
3. 나쁘지 않은 그래픽: 2020년에도 꽤 봐줄만 한 그래픽

# 노잼 3가지
1. 자원이 없음: 자원이 없기 때문에 전략적인 면이 많이 없어지고 유닛이 별로 아깝지가 않다
2. 개성없는 유닛들: 기존의 C&C의 개성 넘치는 유닛이 없어지고 다 비슷비슷하게 보임
3. 유닛 생성 제한되어있는 게임 시스템: 전략 시뮬인데도 불구하고 레벨을 올려야지만 유닛을 뽑을 수 있는 이상한 시스템

# 총평
모바일 게임 C&C 라이벌의 토대가 된 듯한 시스템이 많이 보인다. 좋게 말하면 시대를 앞서간 게임이라 할 수 있겠다. 기존 C&C와 일반적인 전략 시뮬레이션이라고 생각하지 않고 플레이하길 추천","Thanks for the Korean support!

# 3 Fun Things
1. Completely Different Game System: A new system that's quite different from existing strategy simulators.
2. Casual Gameplay: It's great because it even shows unit compatibility.
3. Decent Graphics: Even in 2020, the graphics are quite acceptable.

# 3 Boring Things
1. No Resources: Because there are no resources, the strategic aspect is largely lost, and units are not worth spending much on.
2. Uninspired Units: The unique units of existing C&Cs are gone, and they all look similar.
3. Limited Unit Creation: Despite being a strategy simulator, the system requires leveling up to unlock units.

# Overall Review
Many of the systems seem to be the foundation of the mobile game C&C Rivals. To put it bluntly, it's a game ahead of its time. I recommend playing it without thinking of it as a typical strategy simulation or C&C."

Графика упала на уровень по сравнению с предыдущей частью. Сюжет убогий на пол страницы поместится в 3-4 предложения. Вам дается выбор между двумя фракциями какую выберешь такая и концовка игры. Скринов из C&C 4 убрали в игре вы даже намека на них не увидите. Сражения скучные неинтересные! У вас 3 МСЦ на выбор и все они разбалансированные! Игра вне кампании отвратительна и выглядит вот как: садятся два жука и смотрят друга на друга кто-кого переспамит юнитами. Экономическую составляющую в игре полностью убрали вместо ресурсов у вас командные очки которые ограничивают вас в наборе юнитов. 10 юнитов всё - очков командования у вас нет поэтому идите нафиг и воюйте этими 10 юнитами! Сидишь задрачиваешь этот 1 отряд из 10 юнитов... За тиберий, который кстати надо еще до зоны высадки дотащить, используется в качестве улучшения ваших юнитов. На последних этапах игры когда вы всё прокачали тиберий вам больше не нужон и все что вы имеете в игре это ваш долбанный жук и ваш отряд с 10 юнитами. Игра что на высокой сложности что на низкой одинакова и собственно вопрос ""а в чем прикол?"" Типа у вас есть выбор, но от этого выбора у вас ничего не зависит. Кстати компания проходится за 3-5 часов, а их там 2. Чтобы разблокировать весь контент вы должны набрать кучу опыта на 1 фракцию по 15-20 часов дрочни одними и теми же юнитами. Итого игра с 2 фракциями у вас на 40 часов максимум дальше в игре делать нечего. Соревновательного интереса в игре как такового нет из-за вырезанной экономики все что вы можете это спамить юнитами. ВОТ ВСЯ ЭТА ИГРА ВОТ СВОДИТСЯ К ОДНОМУ ЛОГИЧНОМУ ВЫВОДУ - ""ДРОЧНЯ ЮНИТАМИ"" которых между прочим аж целых 10 штук. Пасьянс и то интереснее будет... Не тратьте время на нее","The game is terrible! There's no base building, the units are all the same type, and you can't tell them apart when they're all crammed together. The graphics have dropped a notch compared to the previous game. The plot is pathetic, taking up half a page in 3-4 sentences. You're given a choice between two factions, and the one you choose determines the ending. They've removed the screenshots from C&C 4; you won't even see a hint of them in the game. The battles are boring and uninteresting! You have three MSCs to choose from, and they're all unbalanced! The game outside of the campaign is disgusting and looks like this: two beetles sit down and stare at each other to see who can outspammed whom. The economic component has been completely removed from the game; instead of resources, you have command points, which limit your unit selection. 10 units is all you have—you have no command points, so go and fight with those 10 units! You're sitting there, grinding away at that one squad of 10 units... Tiberium, which, by the way, you still have to get to the landing zone, is used to upgrade your units. In the later stages of the game, when you've maxed out everything, you no longer need Tiberium, and all you have is your damn beetle and your squad with 10 units. The game is the same on both hard and easy difficulties, and the question is, ""What's the point?"" It's like you have a choice, but that choice doesn't affect you. By the way, the campaign takes 3-5 hours, and there are two of them. To unlock all the content, you have to gain a ton of experience with one faction, grinding away at the same units for 15-20 hours. So, playing with two factions gives you a maximum of 40 hours of nothing to do. There's no real competitive edge to the game because of the cut economy; all you can do is spam units. THIS WHOLE GAME BOTTOM LINES UP TO ONE LOGICAL CONCLUSION - ""UNIT WANKING,"" of which there are, by the way, as many as 10. Solitaire would be more interesting... Don't waste your time on it."

To be precise, they have their merits, and flying to bases to fight for territory is indeed more ideal in local wars. The map is too small and the weapons are relatively large, which limits the number of weapons. I know that various attempts have ended in failure, but in the end they were fully utilized by StarCraft 2, simply because StarCraft 2 is still using the previous playing style. If the fourth generation allows two modes to coexist, I believe the score will be second only to Kane's Wrath, but now it seems far from enough."

The only positive thing about it is the cinematics, perhaps because they put all their money into the live-action performances. Back to the mecha and unit design: a few decent mechs are crammed with a ton of light bars, making the units feel like a bunch of plastic toys, completely devoid of the realism of the original 3. It's incredibly disappointing. Nod's units have also gone completely mad, shoving in some gothic elements or something. They're incredibly cheesy, especially the air units. Are you sure they're not toys? They're downright ugly. And the UI is incredibly tacky, especially the victory and defeat icons. What kind of 50-cent special effects are these? Where did the cool 3D rotating logo go?

The gameplay is also incredibly strange. It's become a farming game with a high population limit. The initial selection of several different bases is completely redundant. Coming from the third game, it's completely confusing. The basic operations and gameplay have completely changed, making it incredibly awkward and uncomfortable.

1. Строительство - то что я любил в этой серии - его нет. Я разочаровался в ЕА именно тогда, 10 лет назад.
2. Графика 3 части в разы лучше, чем в 4й. словно создателей сменили, расстреляли, обoccали и изнacиловали. Именно в таком порядке. А на их место поставили людей, которые занимались разработкой мобильных игр.
3. Система баланса - ненужная чушь. Раньше ты строил базу и мог балансировано распределять игру под свою тактику. а сейчас ты просто выбираешь одну из трех систем танка, и воюй всю игру. Благо сменить можно во время игры, но удручает перестройка.
4. Концовку оставили открытой, но я просто не представляю какую наркоманию можно приплести к сюжету. Для меня игра кончилась на третьей части.
5. Каждый раз, чтобы войти в игру, надо вводить логин и пароль к серверам ЕА. Это неправильно как по мне. Игра забывает меня каждый чертов раз.","I liked the game solely for the story. However, there are many downsides:
1. Construction—what I loved in this series—is gone. I became disillusioned with EA right then, 10 years ago.
2. The graphics in Part 3 are vastly better than in Part 4. It's as if the creators were replaced, shot, pissed on, and raped. In that order. And in their place, they installed people who developed mobile games.
3. The balance system is unnecessary nonsense. Previously, you built a base and could balance the game according to your tactics, but now you just choose one of three tank systems and fight the entire game. Fortunately, you can change them during the game, but the restructuring is depressing.
4. They left the ending open, but I simply can't imagine what kind of drug addiction could be woven into the plot. For me, the game ended with Part 3.
5. Every time I want to log in to the game, I have to enter my username and password for the EA servers. This is just not right for me. The game forgets me every damn time."

1)Как в это играть?
Да проблема большая у комьюнити просто запустить игру.Инструкция.
Покупаем игру-при первом запуске или ручками копируем ключ активации-заходим в свой аккаунт ориджина(ну или создаем новый если у вас нет)-добавляем на аккаунт игру-вставляем ключ-привязываем снс4 к акку ориджина-закрываем ориджин-запускаем снс4 через стим-вводим логин и пароль в лаунчере-создаем профиль нового игрока для снс4-заходим в игру-вводим логин и пароль еще раз-все можно играть без геммора и с ЖИВЫМ онлином.
2)Зачем? А потому что в 2020 с ртс на столько все хуе. что снс4 хорошая ртс.Да игра долбанный паралелепипед вопросов но.
-Играть то интересно
-Есть кооп кампания
-Живой на 2020 онлайн.
-Кампания интересна как в старые добрые времена с живыми актерами,сюжетными поворотами и тд и тп.
-Игра отказалась от стандартной механики снс-тоесть база с ресурсами и прочим.Чем взорвала не хило так жопу фанатам. БЛИАДЬ А ГДЕ ТИБЕРИУМ? где харвестеры?как тут какать?.Да соглашусь в корне менять механики для номерной части это плохо.НО .но,с новой механикой играть то интересно,игра то дарит новый опыт отличаемый от классического я строю электростанцию,я выхожу в казармы я строю ресурсник и параллельно пару солдат.Типичный дебют в ртс(стандартные действия для каждой партии) убираются сразу тут можно с розгона в карьер.Игра стала более динамичной не дающее игрокам сидеть в обороне.Интересная механика с профилями армии.Атака-Защита-Поддержка.Это все не обычно но интересно.Но это сыграло с игрой злую шутку,большинство комьюнити бомбануло,не разобралось и похоронило игру а вместе с ней и серию.Класс.
-Но кроме спорных моментов игра себе сама выстрелила пару раз в ногу.
1)Фракции,их всего две.В стратегии в 2010.Да разрабы после 2003 поняли что ртс на 2 фракции гивно и начали пилить на 3.Даже в 2 и 3 сс были забытые и скрины.А тут что?НОД ГДИ-нейтральная постройка с 3 типами юнитов забытых.ВСЕ.А где 3 фракция?Нельзя было сделать тех же скриннов или забытых сделать полноценной игровой фракцией?Или кого то новых?Например людей которых заипла грызня между гсб и нод и они создали свою фракцию под названием-как меня это все надоело пойду вломаю по роже всем кто воюет (я образно).А тут 2 фракции.Да юнитов много но 2 фракции?Але?В стар варс емпаир эт вор в аддоне 3 было.
2)Открытие юнитов за опыт.Ну тут гениально,я покупаю ртс а получаю открытие юнитов (способностей) как в ММО.Аху,я в шоке.Как бы ЕА ты кто такой *собака женского рода* чтоб это дело? Какого *полового органа* я должен юниты открывать в пвп\пве и кампании? У вас диллер есть .... Вы юниты в киосках покупаете?Вы во что играете? Вы что мудилы?Да при помощи не совсем честных методов можно открыть все юниты для всех 2 фракций часа за 4.НО ЗАЧЕМ? Я понимаю там выбивать достижения или шкурки...НО ЮНИТЫ В ПЛАТНОй ИГРЕ?????
Вердикт такой-дайте игре шанс,если вы раньше не смотрели самое время изза дефицита жанра ртс посмотреть на игру.
Это как стремная баба и бутылка водки,после бутылки водки стремная баба не такая уж стремная.А у нас 2020 и жан ртс.
В 2020 СнС 4 не такая уж плохая игра.","Phew, it's hard to talk about SNS4, but we'll start with two things.
1) How to play?
Yes, the community has a big problem with just launching the game. Here's the instruction.
Buy the game, copy the activation key the first time you launch it, or copy it manually. Log in to your Origin account (or create a new one if you don't have one). Add the game to your account. Insert the key. Link SNS4 to your Origin account. Close Origin. Launch SNS4 through Steam. Enter your username and password in the launcher. Create a new SNS4 player profile. Log in to the game. Enter your username and password again. You can play without any hassle and with LIVE online.
2) Why? Because RTS is so fucked up in 2020 that SNS4 is a good RTS. Yeah, the game is a fucking mess, but there are no questions. - It's fun to play.
- There's a co-op campaign.
- It's live for 2020 online.
- The campaign is as interesting as the good old days, with live actors, plot twists, and so on.
- The game has abandoned the standard SNS mechanics—that is, a base with resources and such. Which has really blew fans' minds. WHERE'S THE FUCK IS TIBERIUM? Where are the harvesters? How can I even say shit here? Yes, I agree that completely changing the mechanics for the numbered unit is bad. BUT, the new mechanics are interesting to play, and the game offers a new experience different from the classic one: I build a power plant, I go to the barracks, I build a resource tank, and at the same time, I build a couple of soldiers. The typical RTS opening (standard actions for each game) is immediately removed; here you can go from strength to strength. The game has become more dynamic, preventing players from sitting on the defensive. Interesting mechanics with army profiles: Attack-Defense-Support. It's all unusual, but interesting. But this played a cruel joke on the game; most of the community got mad, didn't understand it, and buried the game and, along with it, the series. Cool.
- But besides the controversial issues, the game shot itself in the foot a couple of times. 1) Factions, there are only two. In the strategy game in 2010. Yes, after 2003, the developers realized that RTS with 2 factions was crap and started making it 3. Even in SS 2 and 3, there were forgotten units and screenshots. And what's here? NOD GDI is a neutral building with 3 types of forgotten units. THAT'S IT. Where's the 3rd faction? Couldn't they have made the same screenshots or made the forgotten ones a full-fledged playable faction? Or someone new? For example, people who got fed up with the squabble between GSB and NOD and created their own faction called ""I'm so sick of this, I'm going to punch everyone who fights"" (figuratively speaking). And here there are 2 factions. Yes, there are a lot of units, but 2 factions? Hello? In Star Wars, there was an Empire vs. Thief expansion pack, 3. 2) Unlocking units with experience. This is brilliant! I buy RTS and get unlocked units (abilities) like in an MMO. Aha, I'm shocked. EA, who the hell are you, a *female dog*, to even think of this? What *genital organ* am I supposed to unlock units in PvP/PvE and the campaign with? Do you have a dealer? Do you buy units from kiosks? What are you playing? Are you idiots? Yes, using less-than-honest methods, you can unlock all units for all two factions in about 4 hours. BUT WHY? I understand earning achievements or skins... BUT UNITS IN A PAID GAME?????
The verdict is: give the game a chance. If you haven't tried it before, it's high time you gave it a try due to the shortage of RTS games. It's like a creepy woman and a bottle of vodka. After the bottle of vodka, the creepy woman isn't so creepy. And we're in 2020 and RTS.
In 2020, SnS 4 isn't such a bad game."

1.相较RA，将军和其他泰伯，游戏模式变化太大了，人口限制这一改动在我看来直接杀死这游戏，而且建筑，技能，部队分开来搞，本意吧，我猜是加强团队合作，降低操作难度，可实际上战斗节奏太快，5V5一打团人都找不到了。
2.游戏模式太单一，玩起来太累，还要升级解锁单位，20级前对面AI压你等级，肝死。
3.剧情这。。。太草率了
但不得不说，这个游戏在渲染，模型和BGM方面做的很良心（Nod的战斗音乐上头）
哎。。。CNC系列就这么烂尾说实话真的难受，期待将来RA2和CNC2重做（将军有生之年能见到重做吧）","The first time I played it was in 2016, when both GDI and Nod reached level 20. If it weren't for the memories and this recent price drop, I wouldn't have bought it again. Here are my reasons:
1. Compared to RA, General, and other Tiber games, the game mode has changed dramatically. The population limit change, in my opinion, killed the game. Furthermore, the buildings, skills, and troops are now separate. I guess the original intention was to enhance teamwork and reduce the operational difficulty, but in reality, the battles are too fast-paced. In a 5v5 group fight, you can't find anyone.
2. The game mode is too monotonous and tiring to play. You have to level up and unlock units, and before level 20, the opposing AI outclasses you. It's a bit of a grind.
3. The story is... too sloppy.
But I have to say, this game's rendering, models, and background music are very well done (I'm addicted to Nod's battle music).
Alas... It's really sad that the C&C series ended so badly. I look forward to the future remakes of RA2 and C&C2 (I hope General will see them in his lifetime)."

Я несколько раз начинал в нее играть, и даже почти прошел. Я надеялся разглядеть в ней хоть какую-то ценность, подвергая сомнению всю критику. И у меня не получилось. Единственное, что в этой игре бесспорно круто – это главное меню. Я залипал в него каждый раз, когда запускал игру. Оно излучает обещания пафоса и эпичности, и когда ты видишь его в первый раз, то не повестись невозможно. Кажется, что вот оно – невероятное и долгожданное приключение в любимой вселенной. Но хуй там плавал, к сожалению.

Иронично, что большинство критики таки оказалось вкусовщиной. Однако в каждом случае я все равно приходил к выводу, что игра говно. Например, все говорят, что персонажи плохие и никто не запоминается, кроме Кейна, и что актерская игра плохая и сюжет тупой. Это только отчасти правда. Я не знаю, куда люди смотрели, но актерская игра в роликах очень хорошая. Они стараются, и это ясно видно. А вот сами роли – плохие.

Или, например, фанаты серии ругают мультяшность графики, хотя в ней нет вообще ничего плохого. Я бы даже сказал, что она крутая. И эффекты сделаны очень красиво. А вот дизайны юнитов – это пиздец. Большую часть игры на экране какие-то коробки либо на колесах, либо летающие, которые с первого взгляда очень непросто отличить друг от друга. При этом некоторые отдельные юниты выглядят очень классно. Например, мотоциклы, стелс танки и шагоходы. Но все это теряется на фоне заполоняющих коробов, особенно у ГДИ.

И сам геймплей тоже обругали, главным образом за то, что нельзя строить базу. По-моему, эта игра вышла слишком рано, а разработчики, в свою очередь, опередили время. И практически предсказали тренд компьютерных игр на десятилетие вперед. Но ни аудитория не была готова, ни сами разработчики не были готовы сделать это правильно. Мне кажется, что если бы она выходила сегодня, то с некоторыми поправками такая моба-стратегия могла бы и выстрелить. Я был бы более чем не против поиграть в такую игру сейчас, если бы ее сделали с прицелом на конкурента доты, лольца и прочих овервотчей.

P.S. Финальный ролик – ебаный пиздец. Просто ебаный стыд. Очень дешево и всрато одновременно.","I really wanted this to be a true installment in the series, not a last-minute imitation that they'd tweaked and tried to pass off as genuine. I tried to play it several times, and even almost finished it. I hoped to find some value in it, questioning all the criticism. And I failed. The only thing undeniably cool about this game is the main menu. I was glued to it every time I launched it. It exudes a promise of pathos and epicness, and when you see it for the first time, it's impossible not to fall for it. It seems like this is it—an incredible and long-awaited adventure in a beloved universe. But unfortunately, it was a complete failure.

It's ironic that most of the criticism turned out to be a matter of taste. However, in each case, I still came to the conclusion that the game is crap. For example, everyone says the characters are bad and no one is memorable except Kane, and that the acting is bad and the plot is dumb. This is only partially true. I don't know what people were looking at, but the acting in the cutscenes is very good. They're trying hard, and it's clearly visible. But the performances themselves are bad.

Or, for example, fans of the series criticize the cartoonish graphics, although there's nothing wrong with them at all. I'd even say they're cool. And the effects are very beautifully done. But the unit designs are a disaster. Most of the game shows boxes on screen, either on wheels or flying, which are very difficult to distinguish from each other at first glance. That said, some individual units look really cool, like motorcycles, stealth tanks, and walkers. But all of this gets lost in the background of the overflowing boxes, especially in GDI.

And the gameplay itself has also been criticized, mainly for the inability to build a base. In my opinion, this game came out too early, and the developers, in turn, were ahead of their time. They practically predicted the trend in computer games for a decade to come. But neither the audience was ready, nor the developers themselves were ready to do it right. I think if it were released today, such a MOBA strategy game could have been a success with a few tweaks. I'd be more than willing to play such a game now if it were made with an eye toward competing with Dota, LoL, and other Overwatch games.

P.S. The final trailer is fucking awful. It's just fucking disgraceful. It's cheap and completely fucked up at the same time."

They removed the core gameplay in favour of an untested premise that proved largely inferior and alienated the fans and vets (the only people who would play) and gave a pretty lacklustre rushed story.

Lots of the game feels out of balance and overhauled units and other things unnecessarily. C&C 3 did exist and had gotten very close to a great system, yet they threw out all of that to try something completely different?

I bought it in 2018 and have been playing ever since. The music is absolutely amazing; it's incredibly immersive, and the action is incredibly exciting the moment you hear it. The storyline is actually pretty good, though the ending might be lame. The gameplay has a bit of a MOBA vibe. When I played with friends, we even had to strictly divide up the roles and stuff [laughs]. While the population limit is definitely a drawback, conquering the battlefield with a meager population is a uniquely enjoyable experience. The multiplayer aspect of this game is far more enjoyable than playing alone. Think about all the times I've let down my teammates, and even getting scolded isn't a big deal. After all, true friendships are forged in teamwork. You can just take your time leveling up. The 5v5 competitive mode is truly addictive, and I'm constantly trying to figure out different playstyles and lineups. I'd love to see the free teaming experience someday, regardless of faction restrictions. All in all, this unique RTS game has a lot of potential. How it develops specifically still depends on EA. In short, I give this game an absolute thumbs up."

The formula is completely different and forces you to be more resourceful. Resource harvesting is gone and bases are essentially mobile.

Bugs: Vai bem até, nada preocupante
Unidades: Tem umas bacanas, como aviões de cura bem grandes, mas nada incrível
Jogabilidade: Mudou muito da série:
- Agora temos 3 tipos de bases, e elas definem o tipo de unidade que podemos construir, e não tem tanto aquele conceito mais de cravar no chão e defender
- As unidades parecem carro de palhaço, nunca para de sair mais da base. Tem lá um cap que limita o total, mas não tem aquela restrição de quanto melhor minera recursos melhor teu exército... ficou bem mais superficial.
Progressão: isso ficou bom pelo menos, vai ganhando experiência e assim mais algumas unidades novas, mas não tem uma árvore para escolher, é meio tosco, linear mesmo.

- We now have three types of bases, and they define the type of unit we can build, and it's not as much about sticking it in the ground and defending.
- The units look like clown cars, they never stop leaving the base. There's a cap that limits the total, but there's no restriction that the better you mine resources, the better your army... it's much more superficial.

说实话这是CNC系列游戏体验最差的一款了，EA的创新不仅没有给CNC带来新生反而给CNC的棺材钉上了最后一颗钉子。
说这款一无是处的话是十分不公平的。单位设计与模型很棒；进攻、防御、支援的设计也还可以；如果抛去及其垃圾的剧情和CNC续作的滤镜来看的话至少是一款勉强及格的游戏。以上就是所有我能挑出来的优点了。
至于该游戏的缺点，包括但不限于过少的人口，体验极差的遭遇战，不知道是谁脑袋一热想出来的升级解锁单位，这都给这个游戏带来了极差的游戏体验，再加上食屎级的剧情，造就了CNC历史上最差的作品。
及其不推荐购买，即使是抱着试一试的心态也不要买，你会后悔的","After much deliberation, I've decided to give it a negative review.

To be honest, this is the worst CNC game in the series. EA's innovations haven't given CNC a new lease on life, but have instead hammered the final nail in its coffin.

To say this game is completely worthless is completely unfair. The unit designs and models are excellent; the attack, defense, and support systems are also passable; if you look past the abysmal plot and the CNC sequel lens, it's at least a passable game. Those are all the positives I can find.

As for the game's shortcomings, they include but are not limited to the small population, the abysmal skirmish experience, and the seemingly impulsive idea of ​​leveling up to unlock units. These all contribute to a dreadful gaming experience. Add to that the abysmal plot, and this makes this the worst CNC game in history.

I highly recommend not buying this game, even if you're just trying it out. You'll regret it."

Даже Кейна подпортили, как по мне. Хотя Джо Кукан всё еще играет отлично. Никогда не забуду Кейна предыдущих частей. 2. Игра не стоит своих денег. Я за Red Alert 3 готов отдать 999 рублей, а вот за такую короткую, да и можно сказать, сделанную на коленке игру, 1к это перебор. 3. Мертвый мультиплеер (то-ли из-за серверов, то-ли из-за мертвого онлайна, хз). 4. Обесценивание юнитов и построек. Раньше, вы ценили юниты и постройки из-за того, что вы на них тратили большое количество денег. Это очень сказывалось на динамике игры в положительную сторону. Сейчас же это убрали. Вам вообще будет наплевать на юнитов. Потеряли - сделали новых. Это полностью уничтожает разнообразие и динамику. Зачем это сделали? Непонятно. (5). Перевод. Перевод убогий. Например: кому, наxеp, пришла в голову идея о переименовании ГСБ в ГДИ?????. Для тех, кто не в теме, поясню: GDI это Global Defense Initiative, что можно перевести как Глобальный Совет Безопасности. А ГДИ это что? Я даже предполагать не буду. Озвучка посредственная, видно что вообще не старались.  Просто позвали самых заезженных актеров на озвучку, которые просто читают текст. Только Кейн и Жена ГГ озвучены нормально. 6. Защита от взлома. Наличие DRM, постоянное подключение к интернету и необходимость иметь аккаунт EA. (7). Музыка. Не знаю почему, но мне вообще не зашло. Какие-то звездные войны, а не C&C.
() - субъективный или относящийся к определенной версии игры

Плюсы:
Их нет, к сожалению","Cons: 1. The plot is weak, especially the ending (yes, there are several, but essentially, they're the same). The characters are pathetic. Even Kane was ruined, in my opinion. Although Joe Kukan still plays great. I'll never forget Kane from the previous games. 2. The game isn't worth the money. I'm ready to pay 999 rubles for Red Alert 3, but for such a short, and one might even say, hastily made game, 1k is too much. 3. Dead multiplayer (either because of the servers or because of the dead online, I don't know). 4. Devaluation of units and buildings. Previously, you valued units and buildings because you spent a lot of money on them. This greatly impacted the dynamics of the game in a positive way. Now they removed this. You won't care about units at all. They lost them - they made new ones. This completely destroys the variety and dynamism. Why did they do this? It's unclear. (5). Translation. The translation is poor. For example: who the hell came up with the idea to rename GDI to GDI????? For those who don't know, GDI stands for Global Defense Initiative, which can be translated as Global Security Council. And what is GDI? I won't even guess. The voice acting is mediocre; it's clear they didn't try at all. They simply hired the most overused voice actors who simply read the text. Only Kane and the main character's wife are voiced properly. 6. Hacking protection. DRM, constant internet connection, and the need for an EA account. (7). Music. I don't know why, but I didn't like it at all. It feels like Star Wars, not C&C.

I can accept the population cap and the softened graphics. StarCraft, next door, also has a population cap, and it still offers a great experience. Red Alert 3's graphics are even cuter than this, but I still like it. EA then went all-in with Company of Heroes 4, completely destroying the fundamental structure of the RTS. With EASB being so awesome, why didn't they buy mines?

The pathfinding and collision issues remain the same. A single creep walks through the group, and the rest of the team just runs away. This is in stark contrast to StarCraft 2, released the same year.

The plot suddenly became mysterious, and it's all about mindlessly whitewashing Nod. Few of the mysteries left behind by the third game have been solved.

PS: According to some experts, the fourth game was just EA rushing things out, packaging the spin-off Command & Conquer: Arena as a sequel. As a result, a solid RTS game has been reduced to a saga of idiots. EASB is done."

How many words do I need to describe my opinion of this game? Just one: Ugh. The title, ""Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight,"" really lives up to its name. I think they should just remove the ""4"" and ""Tiberium"" and just call it ""Command & Conquer: Twilight."" C&C fans, please don't buy this game. Even if you absolutely must buy it for religious reasons, wait until it's on sale. I admit the background music is good, but the game itself is utterly terrible.
1. Population: As we all know, Blizzard's two masterpieces, StarCraft and Warcraft, were on the same level as Red Alert (Command & Conquer) at the time. One of the things that made Red Alert unique was its unlimited population. Want to experience the Soviet surge of steel? Or perhaps the power of the people? No problem. EA removed this, and I don't understand their plan.
2. Plot: This is complete bullshit. How did Kane suddenly ascend to heaven? And NOD is gone!? What the hell is the connection between the plot and the previous game? 3. In-game: The AI ​​and pathfinding issues from C&C 3 remain unresolved, along with numerous other bugs.

Forgive the swearing, but if I had to praise this game, it would probably be the background music and CG. Kudos to EA for still sticking with live-action CG."

Даже Джозеф Кукан (он же Кейн) своей актерской игрой не смог вытащить этот геймплейно провальный кусок кода. Однако, в 2014 году, я купил диск с этой игрой в одном из магазинов. Целиком ее прошел. Несмотря на низкий рейтинг игры, я получил от нее какое-то удовольствие. Можно много говорить о том, что EA козлины, сделали всё возможное для слива игры, которая превратилась натурально в Halo Wars. Но даже этот слив, который с натяжкой можно назвать ПК RTS, остался у меня в душе приятными воспоминаниями.

Но EA не были бы EA если бы не накосячили даже с релизом в стиме. На стадии предзаказа игры, всем, сделавшим предзаказ, была доступна миссия НОД Night Moves, где под руководством Гидеона нужно было угнать три транспорта, а потом уничтожить краулеры ГДИ. Так вот. 2019 год, на момент покупки игры. Покупаю игру за свои деньги, а этой миссии НЕТ. Прошло 9 лет с релиза игры.

Это была одна из моих любимых миссий, плюс за нее давали максимум 4к опыта, что доп прокачка. А теперь ее тупо нет. Красавцы.","This is undoubtedly the worst game in the C&C series. Even Joseph Kukan (aka Kane) couldn't save this gameplay disaster with his acting. However, in 2014, I bought a copy of this game from a store. I finished it entirely. Despite the game's low rating, I did enjoy it to some extent. You can talk a lot about how EA are jerks, doing everything possible to dump the game, which naturally turned into Halo Wars. But even this dump, which can hardly be called a PC RTS, remains a fond memory for me.

But EA wouldn't be EA if they didn't screw up even the Steam release. When pre-ordering the game, everyone who pre-ordered had access to the NOD mission ""Night Moves,"" where, under Gideon's leadership, they had to hijack three transports and then destroy GDI crawlers. So, that's the year 2019, when I purchased the game. I bought the game with my own money, and this mission is NOT there. It's been 9 years since the game's release. SO WHY THE HELL WAS IT ON A PIRATED FILM FOR 150 RUBLES, AND IN THE LICENSED VERSION, 9 FUCKING YEARS LATER, YOU HAVEN'T GAVE EVERYONE ACCESS TO THIS MISSION???? WHAT THE HELL???

要说他没劲，但是总会莫名其妙就玩上了，说他有劲的话，我还真找不出来哪好玩
怎么玩？很简单
你可以选择闹得或者鸡呆，选择自己的王八种类，分为走地王八（攻击&防御）和飞天王八（支援），而走地王八中还分为了四足王八和履带王八，你的最终目标是占领地图上的王八窝来夺取分数，当然也可以比较激进的去干翻敌人的王八，也可以
同时场上有时会有人投食萝卜，你可以让你的单位去争夺萝卜带回自己的王八沙滩，可以带来一定的升级点数来让自己的王八变得更♂强
正经点好了，先说这一代的较大改变：
1.GDI和Nod不再可以混编，如果你选择的阵营是GDI那么你的队伍必须全都是GDI。
2.不能偷鸡了，就是说双科技不再存在
3.所有的生产建筑集中于MCV上，不再单独建造
4.部分单位的改动，如斗牛犬从反装甲变成了反轻型单位，毒液从反步兵变成了反中型飞行器
5.老生常谈人口上限，并且没了经济，唯一的资源采集是偷泰矿升级（游戏中引导不好，采集泰矿之后运回自己颜色的网格状地形基地后方可获得点数）
主要还是这些，都说怕是说到明年，游戏上我也不能评判出来是不是有意思，首先游戏里杀伤力低的出奇（遭遇战可以改）尤其是镭射伤害打步兵特别感人，反制很死板，几乎就是个石头剪刀布，当然只娱乐也不是不能框框A，火炮伤害打轻中还行，重甲也能看（会有点小吃瘪）不考虑防空直接爆猎手和复仇者就行了，死板这算是第一个减分点吧
第二嘛，这个EA当初自己宣传的时候就说了，这一代拥有最多的玩具，前提是你够肝。遭遇战效率低，战役因为科技不全肯定会吃亏，如果单刷一关战役多多少少会破坏掉剧情体验，当然在线模式也能得到经验但是这游戏虽然有人玩但是匹配得到算我输
但是也不用特别担心，只要按剧情走拥有的军备是完全可以走完全流程的，不需要刻意刷满级，虽然这么说但是有单位不让用心里也挺恼火的
第三我不知道算不算缺点，我本来以为这一代没了采集建设应该会更简单，但是没想到其实是更难了 
首先因为这个死板的克制，队伍构成和单位配合变得尤为重要，其次需要占领多个目标，不玩多线操作是不行的
这也就代表了这个游戏的门槛，之前有RTS或RTT经验的人还好，但萌新会被百分之一万的劝退
开始玩着可能觉得还不错，但通关就腻了
啊对了顺便一说，本来是想抱着对开发者的最基本的敬意看完制作人员名单，没想到不止画面是重复的连名单都是tm循环播放

说第三点之前插几句，既然是CNC那怎么少的了批斗EASB的环节呢
本身这个游戏原名是 命令与征服：竞技场，一个网游性质的外传，但因为EA对EALA制作组的低效率感到不满，要求制作CNC正传恰烂钱，但时间完全不充裕（据说不足一年）开发是完全不可能的，于是将竞技场包装成了泰伯利亚黄昏
CC4中不少可以看的到赶工的痕迹，后面剧情方面也会稍微谈一些

但最大的错就在于你身为一个收官作明知自己只有死忠粉才会玩的情况下出了一个RTT游戏

P.S. 这作平衡并不好，加上死板的克制导致你即使全力了想带几个丢人ai也很难扳回局势，你拼了老命攻占来的节点赚到的那一点分可能还不如ai队友往对方老家送死了好几台猛犸带残骸丢的分多

3.剧情：5/10

以下情节包含剧透

终于到了最重要的环节了，CC正传的灵魂之一摆在这，也是王八竞技场的最大槽点，以下分析不喜勿喷
首先最大的吃书点是茄子咕咕咕了，说好的要来报复人类结果影子都没看见一个

尊王：地球的臭弟弟们爷来辣，吔我黄金舰队
茄子AI：正在链接服务器 地球 确认吗？
尊王：确认，搞快点
茄子AI：无法链接至EA服务器，请检查您的网线是否已拔出
尊王：QNMD，丝巾科技天下第一，搁这看不起谁呢
茄子AI：连接超时，正在返航
尊王：？？？？？

除此之外仍然有其他待解释的bug，比如全世界已不存在黄区蓝区，包括GDI总部莫名其妙都遭到了泰伯利亚的污染（zocom：摸了）而全世界剩下的唯一还能控制的污染区只有巴黎（我看今天谁敢乳法.jpg）但也产生了一些个人想法，希望各位可以积极指正或补充

1.GDI才是最大反派？CC4为nod洗白？
个人感觉没有这种说法
GDI的主观目的在于彻底净化这颗星球，而Nod的目的则是协助凯恩完成""升天""
最终的结局这么一看其实是双赢，只不过[b]GDI的胜利建立于Nod的胜利之上[/b]
洗白其实也说不上，CC里也并没有传统欧美爽片里的明确善恶观念，GDI不一定代表正义，Nod也不一定代表邪恶，但说真的我感觉王八竞技场的Nod结局才是正统结局

2.游戏中各个派系的关系？
游戏中大致有4个派系，[b]李奥斯领导的GDI理事会，詹姆斯旗下的GDI激进派，凯恩名下的Nod正统，还有隶属吉迪恩的Nod分裂主义[/b]，13和24为合作关系
倒是有个有意思的点，兄弟会每一代都不缺二五仔，算是传统艺能了。至于吉迪恩的叛变并一路阻碍凯恩的升天计划，官方似乎并没有解释，（在吃书漫画里面吉迪恩甚至都是凯恩一手安排的）
也不排除另一种可能，就是吉迪恩对凯恩的升天计划的改变感到不满
Nod最初信念是用泰伯利亚改造地球实现进化（通过命令与征服2可以了解最终可能将世界泰化，最后光头也升天便乘了光），但后来凯恩将自己升天的概念更换为""离开地球""。吉迪恩有可能是早期信念的拥护人，可能觉得我们辛辛苦苦打拼事业而光头却在想着跑路，才是真正的背叛者，把所有nod信徒摆了一道，自然有理由鼓动大量成员转而支持他的分裂主义并不遗余力的破坏升天计划

当然也有可能是EASB纯粹懒得编剧情直接吃书了

GDI方面詹姆斯的激进作为更偏向于公报私仇，因为她的两个孩子在第三次泰伯利亚战争中被思金人杀死，认为凯恩就是这一切的始作俑者（确实），同时凯恩与GDI的合作中仅仅与高层说明了自己的升天会彻底消除泰伯利亚，其余的官员都蒙在鼓里，詹姆斯认为凯恩开启传送门想把思金人引回地球引发新的战争，之前的事故早就给詹姆斯心底留下的恐惧阴影，这使她慢慢丧失理智，一切信念驱使她一心只想把凯恩从地球上彻底抹除

3.关于GDI第五关帮助主角越狱的人
这个也没有官方解释，神秘人杜凯特干员似乎在那一关之后就再也没出现过，那么他究竟是谁？目的是什么？
有一句不经意的话：有一个重要的人需要你离开
很明显了，他有极大可能是凯恩的信使，为什么？
除主角外的最后一位TCN植入者帕斯卡博士遭到杀害，但TCN的启动迫在眉睫，凯恩必须保证唯一可以操作TCN的主角的存活来完成自己的目的
同时在游戏开始时告诉主角""你需要支援，现在就要""然后就会有空降仓投下一只GDI步兵小队，而不是Nod的步兵，可见此人在GDI内部也拥有一定的权力（鸡呆：有内鬼，终止交易）
更多的资料似乎也不太好挖掘了，EASB也是真的绝，一个线性剧情的故事整的迷惑的不行还得东拼西凑自己推敲，当然也不排除是故意为了这样（cc4开发周期被大削，可能也是EALA为了减少工程量才这么做）
暂时先说这些 以后想起来再补的
总之cc4作为收尾作确实剧情缺少张力，上一代几乎是关系星球存亡的战斗到了这一代变成了小规模冲突，而且疯狂吃书，但毕竟官方最后一作也没办法不承认，但要说实在的，也算看的下去，虽然真的很让人失望
对了这一代剧情短的出奇，嗦不粗话
P.S. 虽然剧情涝但是其实还是被EA砍过，比如Nod线其实有自己的开头而不是继承GDI的分支等等
4.音乐：9/10
这一作的音乐非常棒，只能说配乐遇到一群猪队友带不动，不过不推荐各位玩之前去网易云等平台试听，一是平台收录几乎都不完整，二是cc4的音乐搭着游戏玩才有内味，只不过初次玩Nod你可能会有一种GLA的即视感，毕竟都是以女声吟唱为主+宗教感十足的风格，玩多了之后会感觉比鸡呆的还要有感觉

总之如果打总分的话，画面（10%）游戏性（50%）剧情（30%）音乐（10%）
（也不能说区别对待吧，隔壁RA3 本身就不是以剧情为主，所以剧情分占比较低，而cc正传这里剧情是灵魂呀，所以比重较高）
对于一路玩过来的cc粉丝来说，它就是这个最终得出来的5.9分了，但对于未接触过这个系列的人来说，其实真正的游戏体验比这个数字要高的多，玩起来感觉也还不错，不过也不能说粉丝挑剔，而是这个游戏配不上叫[b]4[/b]

Once completed, you can play normally. Turtle Arena is essentially a buy-to-play online game like R6S.
(No need to download the rotten orange version.)
Honestly, Turtle Arena isn't as bad as you might think.
[b]1. Graphics: 7.5/10[/b]
Many people are complaining that the graphics aren't as good as CC3, imitating the cartoon style of R3. This is true. The R3 series has always leaned towards ""political jokes"" and ""black humor,"" and many people are fine with the cartoon style. However, the worldview of the main CC series has always been relatively rigorous since the first generation, so this does look a bit awkward. Of course, I don't think the graphics are entirely flawed. This generation's models are a bit more sci-fi, and they look cool, which is fine. [strike] However, the units require a lot of grind, which is annoying. [/strike] Secondly, at least CC4 doesn't have excessive light pollution (the shield brightness is acceptable. The only thing I can say is that the Firehawk airstrike is quite bright, but the yellow faction color in RA3 is blinding). Unit detail is decent, but only just okay (the Titan's cat ears after consuming a blue core are quite cute). Personally, I think it's generally acceptable, and not as bad as some people criticize.

[b]2. Gameplay: 5.5/10[/b]
If I say it's boring, I always find myself playing it. If I say it's exciting, I really can't find what's fun about it.
How do I play? It's pretty simple.
You can choose to be either Noisy or Chitose, and then select your own turtle type, which is divided into ground turtles (attack & defense) and flying turtles (support). Ground turtles are further divided into four-legged turtles and tracked turtles. Your ultimate goal is to capture turtle nests on the map to gain points. Of course, you can also be more aggressive and overthrow enemy turtles.
At the same time, people will occasionally throw carrots on the field. You can have your units fight for the carrots and bring them back to your own turtle beach. This will earn you upgrade points to make your turtles stronger.

Now, let's get down to business. Let's talk about the major changes in this game:
1. GDI and Nod can no longer be mixed. If you choose GDI, your team must be all GDI. 2. No more stealing, meaning dual techs no longer exist.
3. All production buildings are now centralized around the MCV, no longer building them individually.
4. Some units have been changed, such as the Bulldog, which has gone from anti-armor to anti-light units, and the Venom, which has gone from anti-infantry to anti-medium aircraft.
5. As always, there's a population cap, and with no economy, the only way to collect resources is to steal Tiberium for upgrades (though if you're not very good at it, you'll earn points for collecting Tiberium and transporting it back to your own colored grid base).
That's all I'm saying. I'm afraid the game won't be released until next year. I can't really tell whether it's fun or not. First, the game's damage is incredibly low (you can tweak it in encounters). Laser damage against infantry is especially depressing, and counters are incredibly rigid, practically rock-paper-scissors. Of course, just for fun, that doesn't mean you can't just attack with ease. Artillery damage is decent against light and medium enemies, and decent against heavy armor (a bit underwhelming). Ignoring air defenses, just take out Hunters and Avengers. That rigidity is the first downside, I guess.

Second, EA advertised this game as having the most toys, but only if you're dedicated. Encounter combat is inefficient, and the campaign is definitely at a disadvantage due to the lack of comprehensive technology. Soloing the campaign will somewhat ruin the story experience. You can still gain experience in online mode, but even though this game is played, I lose if I get matched.

Don't worry too much, though. As long as you follow the storyline, you can complete the game with your existing armaments. You don't need to grind to the max. Having said that, it's still annoying to be denied access to units.

Third, I'm not sure if it's a drawback. I thought this game would be easier without gathering and building, but it's actually harder. First, due to this rigid counter-strategy, team composition and unit coordination become crucial. Second, capturing multiple objectives requires multitasking.

This also reflects the game's entry level. Those with RTS or RTT experience might be fine, but newbies will be completely put off.

You might find it enjoyable at first, but you'll tire of it once you've completed it.

Oh, by the way, I originally intended to read the credits out of basic respect for the developers, but not only were the screens repeated, but even the credits played on a loop.

Before I get to the third point, a few words: since it's CNC, how can I miss the EASB critique?

The original name of this game was Command & Conquer: Arena was an online game spin-off. EA, dissatisfied with the inefficiency of the EALA development team, demanded a sequel to Command & Conquer to cash in. However, with limited time (reportedly less than a year), development was impossible. So, Arena was packaged as Tiberian Twilight.

Civil Service IV shows numerous signs of rush work, and I'll discuss the story later.

But the biggest mistake was releasing a RTT game for the final game, knowing only die-hard fans would play it.

P.S. This game isn't well balanced, and the rigid control makes it difficult to turn the tide even if you try your best and bring in a few disgraceful AIs. The few points you earn from desperately capturing a node might be less than the points lost by your AI teammates sending several Mammoths to the enemy's base and carrying wreckage.

3. Plot: 5/10

The following plot contains spoilers.

Finally, we've reached the most important part. One of the spirits of the original CC is here, and it's also the biggest flaw in Turtle Arena. If you don't agree with the following analysis, please don't criticize.
First and foremost, the biggest disappointment is Eggplant's grumbling. He promised revenge on humanity, but there's not even a trace of him.

Zun Wang: Earth's stinking little brothers, here comes my Golden Fleet!
Eggplant AI: Connecting to server, Earth, are you sure?
Zun Wang: Confirmed, hurry up!
Eggplant AI: Unable to connect to EA servers. Please check if your network cable is unplugged.
Zun Wang: QNMD, Silk Scarf Technology is the best in the world. Who are you looking down on here?
Eggplant AI: Connection timed out. Returning to base.
Zun Wang: ??? ? ?

Besides that, there are still other bugs that need to be explained. For example, there are no longer any yellow or blue zones in the world, and even GDI headquarters has been inexplicably contaminated by Tiberium (Zocom: Touched). The only remaining controllable contaminated area in the world is Paris (let's see who dares to say that today.jpg). But I also have some personal thoughts, and I hope you can actively correct or supplement them.

1. Is GDI the ultimate villain? Does CC4 whitewash Nod?
Personally, I don't think so.
GDI's subjective goal is to completely cleanse the planet, while Nod's goal is to assist Kane in his ""ascension.""
The final outcome, from this perspective, is actually a win-win situation, but [b]GDI's victory is built on Nod's victory[/b]
It's not really a whitewash. CC doesn't have the clear-cut good and evil concepts of traditional European and American blockbusters. GDI doesn't necessarily represent good, and Nod doesn't necessarily represent evil. But honestly, I feel that the Nod ending in Turtle Arena is the canonical ending.

2. What are the relationships between the various factions in the game? There are roughly four factions in the game: the GDI Directorate led by Leos, the GDI Radicals under James, the Nod Orthodoxy under Kane, and the Nod Separatists under Gideon. Nod 13 and Nod 24 are in a cooperative relationship. An interesting point is that every generation of the Brotherhood has had its share of traitors; it's a tradition. As for Gideon's betrayal and subsequent obstruction of Kane's Ascension plan, there seems to be no official explanation (in the comics, Gideon is even orchestrated by Kane). It's also possible that Gideon was unhappy with Kane's change in his Ascension plan. Nod's original belief was to use Tiberium to transform the Earth for evolution (as seen in Command & Conquer 2, where the world could eventually be Tiberiumized, with the Bald Man ascending and riding the light). However, Kane later changed his concept of ascension to ""leaving Earth."" Gideon might be a proponent of the earlier beliefs, perhaps feeling that we've worked so hard to build our careers while Baldy is thinking of running away, making him the true traitor. He's playing a trick on all of Nod's followers, naturally motivating a large number of them to support his separatist ideology and sabotage the Ascension Project.

Of course, it's also possible that EASB simply couldn't be bothered to write a plot and simply went with the book.

On the GDI side, James's radical actions are more likely a personal vendetta. Her two children were killed by the Scrin during the Third Tiberium War, and she believes Cain is the culprit (which is true). Meanwhile, in his collaboration with GDI, Kane only explained to senior management that his ascension would completely eliminate Tiberium, leaving the rest of the officials in the dark. James believed Kane opened the portal to lure the Scrin back to Earth and spark a new war. The previous incident had already left a shadow of fear in James' heart, slowly driving her sanity. Her single-minded determination to completely wipe Kane off the face of the earth was driven by her convictions.

3. Regarding the person who helped the protagonist escape prison in GDI's fifth level: There's no official explanation for this. The mysterious Operator Duquette seems to have disappeared after that level. So who is he, and what is his purpose?

There's a casual remark: ""There's someone important who needs you to leave."" Clearly, he's most likely Kane's messenger. Why? Dr. Pascal, the last TCN implant recipient besides the protagonist, has been killed. However, the TCN's activation is imminent, and Kane must ensure the survival of the protagonist, the only one capable of operating the TCN, to achieve his goal. Also, at the start of the game, he tells the protagonist, ""You need support, and you need it now,"" and a drop pod drops a GDI infantry squad, not Nod infantry, suggesting this person holds considerable power within GDI (Jidai: There's a mole, deal terminated). Further information seems difficult to uncover. EASB is truly incredible. A linear storyline is so confusing that you have to piece it all together. Of course, this isn't ruled out as intentional (CC4's development cycle was significantly shortened, perhaps EALA did this to reduce engineering workload). That's all for now. I'll add more to it later if I remember.

Anyway, CC4, as the final game, lacks plot tension. The battles that were almost planet-or-death in the previous game have become small-scale skirmishes in this one, and it's a complete overkill. But after all, it's the official final game, so you can't deny it. Honestly, it's still playable, though it's truly disappointing.

By the way, this game's plot is surprisingly short, and I'm not going to say anything bad.

P.S. While the plot is laggy, it's still likely EA's fault for cutting some corners. For example, the Nod arc actually has its own beginning, rather than being a sequel to GDI.
4. Music: 9/10
The music in this game is fantastic. I can only say that the soundtrack can't carry the team if you're dealing with a bunch of idiots. I don't recommend trying it on platforms like NetEase Cloud Music before playing. Firstly, the collections on those platforms are mostly incomplete, and secondly, CC4's music only really feels right when you play it with the game. However, your first time playing Nod, you might get a bit of a GLA vibe, with its predominantly female vocals and religious feel. After playing more, you'll find it even more engaging than DAMN.

In short, if I were to give it an overall score, it would be graphics (10%), gameplay (50%), story (30%), and music (10%).
(It's not like I'd discriminate against RA3. The story isn't primarily story-driven, so the plot score is relatively low. In the original CC, the story is the heart of the game, so it carries more weight.

For CC fans who've been playing all the way through, this is the final score of 5.9. However, for those new to the series, the actual gameplay experience is much higher than this number, and it feels quite good. It's not that fans are picky, but rather that this game doesn't deserve the name [b]4[/b]

Additional note: It seems CNC4 likes to hide little Easter eggs in generals, such as the Light and Shadow Bomber's ""MiG Fighter"" achievement and the Paladin's ""Crusader"" achievement."

Все остальное принадлежит чему угодно, но не тому, что мы привыкли называть Command & Conquer. Если это был эксперимент ЕА на тему ""давайте поставим игру с ног на голову"", то он удался, но я несколько в шоке. Причины шока:
- Экономики тут нет. Совсем. СКТ построили, тибериум оставили для улучшений юнитов. Нанимай столько, сколько размер армии позволит, а позволит он... в общем, стратегия чуть ли не всегда одна и та же получается в игре за исключением некоторых сюжетных поворотов в самих миссиях;
- Теперь вместо классической базы со зданиями нам выдали аж 3 типа мобильной базы под названием краулер, ориентированные на наступление, оборону и поддержку. Судя по всему, изначально хотели разделить бронетехнику, пехоту и авиацию, но в итоге только в обороне нету смешения первого и третьего, про баланс молчу;
- Вкатили систему званий через набор опыта, которая позволяет пользоваться новыми юнитами и улучшениями. Своеобразный ход, но вот зачем....;
- Улучшения юнитов зачем-то поделили на улучшения от разных видов тибериума, которые получаешь через трофеи с противников, и общие изучаемые через сбор кристаллов тибериума, заодно переломав в ту же сторону систему званий. В итоге получилось так себе;
- Сюжет крайне рваный, многое не обьясняется, все идет кусками, предлагая игроку самому поломать голову над происходящим;
- Отвратительная локализация. С каких пор GDI решили переводить как ГДИ, не знаю...;
- Графика.... Ну вот честно, мне третья часть куда больше понравилась в этом вопросе.

По итогам: пройти стоит ради того, чтобы увидеть завершение тибериумной эры и забыть.","I finally got to the final game in the C&C 4 series, spent 10 hours on the Brotherhood campaign, and realized that the only things that remained of the C&C atmosphere were the name, Kane, Tiberium, and some units from the second game. Everything else belongs anywhere but what we're used to calling Command & Conquer. If this was EA's experiment in ""let's turn the game on its head,"" it was a success, but I'm a bit shocked. The reasons for the shock:
- There's no economy here. None at all. They built the SCT, and left Tiberium for unit upgrades. Recruit as many as your army size allows, and it will... well, the strategy is almost always the same in the game, with the exception of a few plot twists in the missions themselves;
- Now, instead of a classic base with buildings, we're given three types of mobile bases called crawlers, focused on offense, defense, and support. Apparently, they initially wanted to separate armored vehicles, infantry, and aircraft, but in the end, only defense lacks a mix of the first and third, not to mention balance;
- They rolled out a rank system based on experience gain, which allows you to use new units and upgrades. It's a peculiar move, but why...;
- Unit upgrades were somehow divided into upgrades based on different types of Tiberium, which you get through enemy drops, and general upgrades that you can learn by collecting Tiberium crystals, simultaneously upending the rank system in the same direction. The end result was so-so;
- The plot is extremely disjointed, much is left unexplained, everything comes in bits and pieces, leaving the player to puzzle out what's happening;
- Terrible localization. Since when did they decide to translate GDI as GDI, I don't know...;
- Graphics.... Honestly, I liked the third game much more in this regard.

In conclusion: it’s worth playing just to see the end of the Tiberium era and forget about it."

First off, you have to create an EA account to do anything.

The game itself somehow looks worse than its predecessors. The units have a strange simplistic blocky look to them and I can't say the UI is much better. Everything just feels off and oversimplified in comparison to the earlier games like Tiberium Wars and Kane's Wrath. What a mess.

Meanwhile the gameplay is somewhere between mediocre and infuriating.

体验过后：真是一坨屎。
首先要注册账号，好吧这年代基本操作。
账号注册后开玩，序列号输入，正版游戏嘛~ STEAM都帮我一键复制了。复制确定后~  一般性错误~？？？
可能是我哪里搞错了重来~要重新输入账号密码！也就是每次进游戏都要输入账号密码！序列号怎么都不对，百度后原来序列号要去网上兑换~
这都不算什么。进游戏打单机竟然需要全程联网。经常掉线，打到掉线过关了还不算，还不能进入下一关甚至是当前奖励也没有。只能在某个自动记录的点继续。于是就必须重新输入账号密码，确认玩游戏的名字进入游戏。等于打单机还回档。。。
最致命的还是游戏内容了。不是即时战略的收集资源发展造兵了。而是给你一个指挥中心要什么兵直接按。什么科技发展。就是指挥中心研究一下。反正没有钱的概念，反正你除了指挥中心就是50人口的兵。每个兵人口还不是1。根本早不了多少兵。战术？兵不要钱我就多造点没有战损这一说。50坦克换对方一兵也不亏嘛。这是在玩什么？操作手感也差得不行。除了特效，氛围玩法都不如2.补票？钱也没进WW公司算了吧。","I wanted to buy the entire series for nostalgia, so I bought it all while it was on sale. For a real-time strategy fan, how bad could it get? I've never played a difficult RTS!

After trying it out: It's a complete mess.
First, you have to register an account, which is pretty basic these days.
After registering, I started playing and entered my serial number. Since it's a legitimate game, Steam copied it for me with one click. After the copy was confirmed, I got a general error? ???
Maybe I made a mistake and have to re-enter my account and password! This means I have to enter my account and password every time I enter the game! The serial number is always wrong. After searching on Baidu, I realized it requires redemption online.
That's not even a big deal. Playing single-player requires a full internet connection. I frequently disconnect, and even if I complete a level, I still can't progress to the next level, and I don't even get the current reward. I can only continue at a certain automatically recorded point. So I have to re-enter my account and password and confirm my game name to enter the game. It's like playing single-player and then rewinding. The most devastating thing is the gameplay. It's not a real-time strategy game where you gather resources, develop, and build troops. Instead, you have a command center where you click on any soldier you want. Technology development is just research in the command center. There's no money involved. Besides the command center, you have 50 soldiers. Each soldier has less than 1 population. You can't have many soldiers at all. Tactics? Soldiers don't cost money, so I just build more. There's no such thing as casualties. 50 tanks in exchange for one enemy soldier isn't a loss. What's the point of this? The controls are terrible. Aside from the special effects, the atmosphere and gameplay aren't as good as in 2. Want to buy more? I didn't even pay for it, so I'll just forget about it."

帐号我是橘子注册，所以没问题，大不了去橘子上注册，我不相信现在大家连橘子碰都不碰，我是小时候玩的盗版，正版入的不久，频繁的断开连接没遇到，这个就不反喷了。

战斗模式我认为很棒，不是一般的棒，抛弃资源，水晶变成升级点数，让玩家可以全身心的打战术，不再为经营烦恼，因为这就是战术为重点的RTS，帝国时代3已经是运营RTS巅峰，再去做没意思，人优我转。

剩下什么人口少，兵种设计没意义之类的内容喷，我只说一点，需要打垃圾剧情来解锁兵种确实恶心，剧情垃圾我也很烦，但是其它问题已经有大神说了，你们所喷的问题都是不适应造成的，我一直在跟电脑打遭遇磨练技术，所以兵种平衡性我无法评论。

还是老生常谈的内容，玩不惯，玩不爽不是游戏垃圾，是你的问题，之前的命令系列和红警系列在兵种上没有平衡，纯属是爆兵娱乐向RTS，所以突然竞技化肯定不适应，星际2时极限运动，跟你的apm和运营有很大关系，战术啥的根据版本变，到现在都没有做到平衡也是服了。","Having played Command 3, Kane's Wrath, the Generals series, and RA3 as a kid, I found Command 4 quite boring. The storyline was rubbish, the population settings were tedious, and the fighting was endless, with no time to breathe. But after playing Company of Heroes and Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War, I realized that Command 4 was a game that really transformed.

My account was registered on Orange, so it's no problem. You can just register on Orange. I don't believe anyone wouldn't even touch Orange these days. I played pirated copies as a kid, and I recently bought the official version. I haven't experienced any frequent disconnects, so I won't criticize them.

I think the battle mode is fantastic, incredibly great. It abandons resources and replaces crystals with upgrade points, allowing players to focus on strategy instead of worrying about management. This is a tactical-focused RTS. Age of Empires 3 is the pinnacle of operational RTS. It's boring to do it again. I'll switch now that I have better players.

As for the criticism about the low population and meaningless unit design, I'll just say one thing: having to play a crappy storyline to unlock units is truly disgusting. The crappy storyline annoys me, too, but the other issues have already been addressed by experts. The issues you're complaining about are simply a result of not adapting to them. I've been honing my skills by playing against the computer, so I can't comment on unit balance.

It's the same old story: if you can't get used to it or have a bad time playing it, it's not a bad game; it's your fault. The previous Command & Conquer series and Red Alert had no unit balance; they were purely RTSs for entertainment, so suddenly becoming competitive is definitely not something you can adapt to. StarCraft 2 is an extreme sport, heavily influenced by your APM and mechanics. Tactics and other things change with each version, and it's unbelievable that they haven't achieved balance yet."

Registering an account on the official website of Rotten Orange to activate the game are all basic operations. The main difficulty lies in logging in for the first time with the Rotten Orange account that activated this game. First of all, when you just start the game, there is an external login interface. If you make a mistake in the password, you will be reminded instantly. It takes a long time to log in normally. In my case, I waited for nearly ten minutes before finally entering the next stage: filling in the in-game ID. At this step, if you think you can play after the game starts, then you are too naive. After entering the game and watching the studio, if a window pops up: The server connection is unexpectedly interrupted, please check the network and try again, and then ask you to enter your account and password again, which basically means you can't log in. Whether you enter the correct or incorrect account, this prompt will pop up indefinitely. What I did was to wait for ten days. During this time, I made RA3 and Uprising difficult. I finished the campaign and got to 60% of Challenge Mode (honestly, the Future Tank and Kirov levels were incredibly challenging). Then, today, I decided to give it one more try, and I got in. I was so shocked! EA finally realized there was another player. It's relatively stable now, but there are still occasional disconnects. This part might help others later, so I wrote a review. It's a rare achievement.

Oh, by the way, I forgot. The day before, on the 18th, I couldn't log into Classic because NetEase Tudou crashed. I didn't know about it, so I used UUI to speed up and changed my hosts file. My hosts file was blank before, so I searched for ""restoring hosts."" Maybe restoring the hosts file allowed me to log in to EA because I was able to log in. Please search Baidu for the specific method.

PS: I manually opened the hosts file with Notepad and added the code, not requiring any other software."

To be fair, this game would be fantastic if you could get a group together to play.
Gorgeous special effects, a highly competitive gameplay process, and a game mode that emphasizes teamwork and mutual support.
It looks great, and I was truly impressed the first time I played it.
But the problem is, it's impossible to get a group together.
The single-player mode of this game is almost uninteresting.
When I play alone, the screen is filled with the words ""boring.""
And that upgrade system—is EA serious about it? It's really boring.
Even more frustrating is that the cutscenes in this game are incredibly poorly done.
The previous game laid a fantastic foundation, laying many foreshadowings that seem to have already pushed the story to its climax. Then, with this installment, the plot fell apart, and the ending was a mess, abruptly ended.
Emotionally, it's unbearable to see such a fantastic game series end up with such a perfunctory and abysmal ending."

 Спойлер к игре: Как оказалось Кейн был Скрином, который 1000 лет ждал прибытия, и благодаря захваченной вышке в третьей части игры, он смог ""вознестись"" (отправиться домой), прихватив с собой всех последователей, своих новых братьев, а что касается командира, киборга, он исполнил свой долг, активировал врата-вышку чужих и благополучно скончался, на этой ноте и завершаются события серии игр C&C, всё, эпилог.
P/s: Хотя бы ради любопытства стоит купить эту игру, чтобы насладиться конечным видеороликом, всё понять и осознать, как же долго бедолага Кейн ждал возвращения домой...","When this game came out, I was indignant about why so many people were dissatisfied. It's a decent game, it's still the same Kane, the same war, even though the resource acquisition and construction mechanics have changed, and the graphics have become a bit childish, but after 2-3 hours, you don't notice it anymore. Over the years, my perception has changed, and now, launching this game, I begin to understand why gamers are so angry at EA. The developers have screwed everything up and ruined the C&C series with their multiplayer mode. Yes, you can play it, but not alone, only with friends (like Red Alert 3). Remembering my first impression of the game, when I managed to snag a pirated disc without bugs and with Russian voice acting for 150-200 rubles (licensed versions cost 450-700 rubles separately or as a collection, and the prices varied from store to store), I give it a thumbs up, as this is the last game in the C&C series that's still a blast to play.
Spoiler alert: As it turns out, Kane was a Scrin who waited 1,000 years for his arrival. Thanks to the captured tower in the third game, he was able to ""ascend"" (go home), taking with him all his followers, his new brothers. As for the commander, a cyborg, he fulfilled his duty, activated the alien gate tower, and died happily. On this note, the events of the C&C series conclude, that's it, epilogue. P/s: If only out of curiosity, it's worth buying this game to enjoy the final video, understand everything, and realize how long poor Kane waited to return home..."

Game: 
Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight
...
About & Plot: 
This is the end to the Tiberium canon universe, Kane and Tiberium leave together, but before that happens you must help either GDI or NOD to get the outcome, the outcome is the same no matter who you side with, really, and there's no bonus nor hidden ending from what I can tell nor find either,
...
Story & Spoilers:
Tiberium has evolved and is spreading at such a rate that the whole planet is expected to become uninhabitable by 2068. Humanity is on the brink of extinction. The player takes the role of Commander Parker, a GDI military officer who receives an optical implant after his battle wounds have caused him to lose his eyesight. The player is presented with the possibility to aid either Colonel Louise James's GDI extremists or Kane's Nod Loyalist forces in the Fourth Tiberium War. After the final battle for the Threshold 19, Kane is about to leave Earth using the Scrin tower. He convinces Commander Parker (the player) to activate it for him with the optical implant. The player is shot by Colonel James but nonetheless succeeds in activating the portal. In both campaigns, Kane enters the portal. In the ending cut-scene, news channels announce that the Tiberium growth has receded following the complete activation of Tiberium Control Network and all the Nod followers have entered the Scrin tower and disappeared. Kane and Nod are no more and Tiberium follows suit slowly, thus closing the book to the Saga.
...
Strategy, Gameplay, Mechanics and Statistics:
The time to take you to beat both campaigns is mmm 3-18 hours depends on how you go about doing it, and highest level is level 20 (GDI) level 20 (NOD) so Max is level 40 witch can take you 3-8+ hours grinding, the best way to grind in skirmishes is medium vs brutal with you on the brutal side and trying to speedrun to 4000 points in the best shortest replay moves, if you play average or are a casual person it can take you 3-5 hours to Max both sides, if you are a pro or an expert at game mechanics or very enthusiastic in ""speedrunning to Lv40"" it can take 1-4 hours and playing the story at max can take 2-5 hours to beat both campaigns so if you tried or wanted you could be New to completing the whole game in under 6-12 hours.
...
The Good and Pro:
-RPG RTS
-5v5 w/A.I
-Short Story
-End to a Saga
-Awesome Music
-No Bugs
...
The Bad and Cons:
-Original intentions for online only
-Adding story and campaign to the game last in development
-Required EA account
-Required one time use access key for the pc
-Requires to be signed in in order to play
-No extra content or hidden content for 100% in the game
-No reward for beating or completing the game
-Both campaign endings are exact with no differences.
-A poorly shoehorn motivation involving your wife
-Cutscenes and Gameplay in campaign refers your wife to get you motivated and have purpose but you're only introduced to her for existing and being like ""this is your wife"" and then dying immediately soon after and is an annoying reminder that's shes a shoe horn into the plot to motivate the player making the story seemed rushed when shes brought up especially how they do it in GDI campaign
...
...
...
CONCLUSION:
I recommend this game, finish and end a book that's just the Tiberium series, the Final Chapter to the Canon Tiberium universe, to have a short game you can complete it in 1-3 days or in 6-12 hours, just ignore the existence of your wife when she is brought up for motivational plot convenience and you have a very nice endgame pages to look at, its got great music, there is no extra stuff for 100% it so you can get it to cross off your list so you don't have to come back to it ever if you don't want to.","10/10

มันไม่ใช่แนว RTS แล้ว มันแนวอะไรก็ไม่รู้ มั่วไปหมด
ข้อดี
1. ถ้าเล่นโดยที่ไม่สนเนื้อเรื่องและภาคเก่าๆ มันยังพอหาความสนุกได้อยู่บ้าง อย่างน้อยมันยังมีแนววางแผนหลงเหลืออยู่บ้าง(มั้งนะ)
ข้อเสีย
1. เล่นออฟไลน์ไม่ได้ บังคับออนไลน์ตลอด ยิ่งถ้าเน็ตไม่ดี มีหลุดกลางเกมอีก
2. เนื้อเรื่องน่าเบื่อ แย่ที่สุด ทำลายตำนานของซีรี่ย์ C&C จนพินาศย่อยยับ ทำเอาตัวร้ายอย่าง Kane ไร้เสน่ห์ไปเลย
3. ระบบออนไลน์แย่ หาห้องยากมาก แทบไม่คนเลย เซิฟห่วยแตก
4. ใช้ยูนิตทุกตัวไม่ได้ ต้องมานั่งลงแมพ ลงเนื้อเรื่อง เก็บแต้มมาปลดล็อคยูนิตแต่ละตัว อันนี้ทุเรศที่สุด เพราะมันควรจะให้ใช้ทุกตัวได้มาตั้งแต่แรก ไม่ใช่มาล็อคแบบนี้
สรุป เละเทะ ทุเรศทุรังที่สุด เข้าใจว่าอยากทำแนวใหม่ แต่ควรไปทำเป็นเกมใหม่เลย ไม่ใช่เอามาทดลองใช้กับเกมซีรี่ย์เก่าเป็นหนูทดลองแบบนี้
คนที่อยากเล่นซีรี่ย์นี้แนะนำไปเล่นภาค 2 กับ 3 แทนจะดีกว่า อย่ามาเล่นภาคนี้ ไม่อยากนับเป็นภาคต่อด้วยซ้ำ","This is the most disastrous C&C installment.
It's not an RTS anymore, it's just a complete mess.
Pros
1. If you play it without caring about the story or the previous installments, it's still somewhat enjoyable. At least there's still some strategy left (I think).
Cons
1. You can't play offline. You're forced to be online all the time. If your internet connection is bad, you'll get disconnected mid-game.
2. The story is boring. It's the worst. It completely ruins the legacy of the C&C series. It makes the villain Kane lose all charm.
3. The online system is terrible. It's very difficult to find a room. There are hardly any people. The servers are terrible.
4. You can't use every unit. You have to sit and play the map, go through the story, and collect points to unlock each unit. This is the worst. Because every unit should be available from the start, not locked like this.
In short, it's a complete mess. I understand the desire to create a new style, but it should be a completely new game. It shouldn't be used as a guinea pig for the old series.
For those who want to play this series, I recommend playing installments 2 and 3 instead. Don't play this one. I don't even consider it a sequel."

С этого момента у некогда культовой серии началась “новая жизнь”. Последующие несколько лет студийные беженцы, примкнувшие к EA Los Angeles, сочли необходимым замешивать рассыпчатый шарм сериала с бульоном на костях – сначала ответвление Generals, потом, наконец, [b]Command & Conquer 3[/b]. Не сказать, что последняя получилась из рук вон плохо, определенно не сказать. Тем не менее, воочию, кроме основы и свежей обертки нужно было добавить чуть больше смелых идей, больше тактики и больше вычурности игрового баланса – обязательно, с пониманием дела. Сейчас же это в прошлом – господа, пробуксовка на месте сменилась левым креном.[/i]

[h1]Тиберий во мгле[/h1]

Electronic Arts преподносила [b]C&C 4[/b] как эпичное завершение саги, длившейся целых 15 лет, и обещала ответить на все вопросы о Кейне и тиберии. Увы, достойного финала не вышло. Одиночная кампания разочарует и тех, кто следил за борьбой GDI и Братства Нод долгие годы, и новичков, которым сценаристы решили вообще ничего не объяснять.

В [b]C&C 3[/b] и [b]Kane’s Wrath[/b] авторы грубо оборвали повествование — Кейн активировал башню инопланетян, и экран утонул в белизне. «Мостик» к [b]C&C 4[/b] до ужаса банален, пусть и логичен. Лидер Нод заполучил технологии фиолетовых жуков-пришельцев, и от «вознесения» его отделяет один шаг. Однако собственных ресурсов Братства не хватило, чтобы провести ритуал и открыть портал. Кейн был вынужден предложить GDI перемирие. Объединив усилия, заклятые враги построили Сеть контроля тиберия. Любителям свободы и демократии она поможет избавить планету от зеленой заразы, а фанатикам — достичь их мистической цели.

Разумеется, не всем в GDI и Нод понравился этот союз. Вскоре вспыхнули масштабные мятежи, затягивающие игрока в водоворот странной гражданской войны. Свои интересы в конфликте преследуют сразу четыре фракции. Видимо, разработчики писали историю под впечатлением от четвертого сезона ""Крейсер ""Галактика"""". О сериале напоминают и некоторые композиции саундтрека, окончательно порвавшего с творчеством Фрэнка Клепаки .

Столь подробное описание сюжета — суровая необходимость. Он подан так скомкано и сумбурно, что информацию приходится по крупицам выуживать из роликов, заданий на миссию, текстов в руководстве пользователя и комиксов на официальном сайте.

К слову, восторга от просмотра видео в [b]C&C 4[/b] нет: декорации бедны как церковная мышь, «пререндер» уступает стареньким [b]Red Alert[/b] и [b]Tiberian Sun[/b], noname-актеры сильно переигрывают. Особенно усердствуют дамы — вечно хнычущая жена главного героя  и его начальница полковник Джеймс. Правда, динамичных моментов больше, чем в [b]C&C 3[/b], и Джо Кукан по-прежнему хорош, но даже злодейская харизма не спасает. Противостояние, решающее судьбу Земли, слишком похоже на возню в песочнице.

Едва локомотив сценария набирает ход, EA LA бьет по тормозам. GDI досталось девять операций, причем в первых трех втолковывают, как двигать камеру и щелкать по кнопкам. Втиснуть интригу в такие узкие рамки было просто невозможно. У Нод ситуация чуть приличнее. Командующий-перебежчик попадает в их ряды после «учебки» GDI, а затем служит новым хозяевам в семи сражениях. 

[h1]Тиберий не тонет[/h1]

Браться за [b]C&C 4[/b] стоит лишь в режиме совместного прохождения, где почему-то недоступны «сейвы». В [b]Red Alert 3[/b] от той же студии именно перепалки с напарником скрашивали самые унылые эпизоды. Да и над уродством графики, порожденной доисторическим движком SAGE, можно посмеяться вдвоем. Впрочем, достоинствам «коопа» не скрыть убожество игрового процесса. EA LA, всегда с опаской глядевшая на эксперименты коллег, в этот раз пошла на радикальные реформы. Вроде бы хотели они как лучше…

Вместо того чтобы пошаманить над геймплейной формулой, авторы… отсекли все «ненужное». Из четвертой части исчезли многие черты, бывшие визитной карточкой C&C, включая харвестеры, строительство базы и снабжение электроэнергией. Тиберий, к середине XXI века отравивший всю планету, в игре почти не встречается. Если бы не истеричные бунтари, Сеть со дня на день завершила бы очистку и принесла мир и спокойствие. А пока редкие кристаллы, разбросанные по закоулкам, идут на улучшения. Зеленые минералы дают право купить один «апгрейд», синие — два, красные — пять.

Все, что остается — возить по полю брани «мобильный штаб» и заказывать в нем подкрепления. Выполнив подряд, «матка» садится на грунт, и выползающие из ее чрева юниты тут же вступают в бой. Финансовых затрат производство не требует, хотя штамповать армию до бесконечности нельзя — лимит позволяет набрать десяток-другой бронемашин.

Какую бы задачу ни поставило начальство, мы действуем по шаблону: затариваемся под завязку и прем к цели, преодолевая сопротивление. Методично «зачищать» карту или проворачивать хитрые маневры незачем. Вражеский конвейер работает не хуже нашего, поэтому противника можно взять только нахрапом. Разгром чужой базы или потеря своей тоже ни на что не повлияют — через несколько секунд покровители пришлют замену.

«Битвы», когда два MCV выезжают на поляну и раскладываются в десятке метров друг от друга, выглядят нелепо. Тактика сведена к подбору правильных аргументов: лазерами вскрыть тяжелую броню, натравить ПВО на самолеты и т. п. Захват нейтральных объектов (автоматических пушек, сенсоров, замечающих «невидимок») не добавляет интереса.

Чтобы оживить вялые схватки «стенка на стенку», EA LA разделила войска по трем специализациям. К первому виду штаба относятся танки, артиллерия и коммандос, ко второму — пехота и оборонительные сооружения, к третьему — авиация и ряд умений, ослабляющих неприятеля и усиливающих союзников. Выбранное направление потом можно сменить на более подходящее.

Правда, оценить все 90 юнитов и зданий нелегко. Изначально игроку подсовывают скромный комплект из 3-4 типов. Другие придется открывать, «прокачивая» свою учетную запись. Драгоценную «экспу» начисляют за основные и промежуточные задания, убийство врагов, заработанные «достижения» и победы в сетевых баталиях. Эта неплохая, в сущности, идея также пострадала от бездарной реализации. По сути, тем, кто не одолел «сингл», запретили встревать в онлайновые разборки. Никакая сноровка не спасет, если вы бросите на пулеметы солдат в бумажных доспехах.

Кроме «Мамонтов» и прочих «толстячков», смотреть на высоких уровнях особенно не на что — искусственно раздутый ассортимент не впечатляет. В [b]Tiberian Sun[/b] и [b]Tiberium Wars[/b] об игре у GDI и Нод были уникальные подразделения, а в [b]C&C 4[/b] их различия минимальны. Разве что «лучи смерти» разных цветов.

Грустно наблюдать за тем, как разработчики решили поставить точку в истории. Верю, что они пытались как лучше, как проще, как интереснее, но получилось абсолютно невыносимо – глубочайший удар под дых фанатам и всей серии в целом. Проект со скучный процессом, отвратительный мультиплеером, кособокой системой достижений и совершенно безобразным графическим стилем. Огрызок стратегии, лишенный не только несущей платформы, но и надежды на будущее.[/i]","The Command & Conquer franchise's whirlwind success hit a low point in the late 1990s, when Westwood underwent a local restructuring under the guise of a merger with Electronic Arts, and shortly thereafter, lost the last vestiges of its independence. From that moment on, the once-cult series began a new lease on life. Over the next few years, studio refugees who had joined EA Los Angeles found it necessary to blend the series' crumbly charm with the broth of its bones—first with the spinoff Generals, then, finally, Command & Conquer 3. It's not to say the latter turned out utterly bad, certainly not. Nevertheless, it's clear that, in addition to the core and fresh packaging, it needed a few more bold ideas, more tactics, and a more sophisticated gameplay balance—certainly with a keen eye for detail. Now, gentlemen, that's a thing of the past—spinning in place has been replaced by a leftward roll.

[h1]Tiberium in the Dark[/h1]

Electronic Arts pitched [b]C&C 4[/b] as the epic conclusion to a 15-year saga and promised to answer all questions about Kane and Tiberium. Alas, a fitting finale didn't materialize. The single-player campaign will disappoint both those who've followed the struggle between GDI and the Brotherhood of Nod for years, and newcomers to whom the writers decided not to explain anything at all.

In [b]C&C 3[/b] and [b]Kane's Wrath[/b], the writers abruptly ended the narrative—Kane activated the alien tower, and the screen faded to white. The ""bridge"" to [b]C&C 4[/b] is terribly banal, albeit logical. The leader of Nod has acquired the technology of the purple alien beetles and is one step away from ""ascension."" However, the Brotherhood's own resources were insufficient to perform the ritual and open the portal. Kane was forced to propose a truce to GDI. By joining forces, the sworn enemies built the Tiberium Control Network. It would help the lovers of freedom and democracy rid the planet of the green plague, and the fanatics achieve their mystical goal.

Naturally, not everyone in GDI and Nod was pleased with this alliance. Large-scale rebellions soon broke out, drawing the player into the maelstrom of a strange civil war. Four factions simultaneously pursue their own interests in the conflict. Apparently, the developers were inspired by the fourth season of ""Battlestar Galactica."" Some of the soundtrack's compositions, which have completely broken with Frank Klepacki's work, also evoke the series.

Such a detailed description of the plot is a harsh necessity. It's presented so cluttered and disjointed that information has to be gleaned bit by bit from cutscenes, mission quests, user manual text, and comics on the official website.

By the way, watching videos in [b]C&C 4[/b] isn't exactly a blast: the sets are as poor as a church mouse, the pre-rendered version is inferior to the old [b]Red Alert[/b] and [b]Tiberian Sun[/b], and the no-name actors are seriously overacting. The women are especially over-the-top—the protagonist's perpetually whining wife and his superior, Colonel James. Granted, there are more action-packed moments than in [b]C&C 3[/b], and Joe Kukan is still a good actor, but even his villainous charisma can't save him. The confrontation that decides the fate of Earth feels too much like a sandbox romp.

Just as the plot's engine is gaining momentum, EA LA slams on the brakes. GDI was given nine operations, and the first three were spent explaining how to move the camera and click buttons. Squeezing intrigue into such a tight framework was simply impossible. Nod's situation is a bit more manageable. A defector commander joins their ranks after GDI's ""boot camp"" and then serves their new masters in seven battles.

[h1]Tiberius Never Sinks[/h1]

[b]C&C 4[/b] is only worth playing in co-op mode, where saves are somehow unavailable. In [b]Red Alert 3[/b] from the same studio, it was the bickering with your partner that brightened up the most dreary episodes. And the ugly graphics, generated by the prehistoric SAGE engine, are enough to make you laugh together. However, the merits of co-op can't hide the gameplay's meagerness. EA LA, always wary of its colleagues' experiments, went for radical reforms this time. It seemed they meant well...

Instead of tinkering with the gameplay formula, the developers... cut out everything ""unnecessary."" Many features that were the hallmark of C&C disappeared from the fourth game, including harvesters, base construction, and power supply. Tiberium, which poisoned the entire planet by the mid-21st century, barely appears in the game. If not for the hysterical rebels, the Network would have completed its cleansing any day now and brought peace and tranquility. In the meantime, rare crystals scattered throughout the nooks and crannies are used for upgrades. Green minerals allow you to purchase one ""upgrade,"" blue ones - two, red ones - five.

All that remains is to transport the ""mobile headquarters"" across the battlefield and order reinforcements from it. Once completed, the ""mother"" lands on the ground, and the units crawling out of its womb immediately join the fight. Production doesn't require any financial outlay, although churning out an army indefinitely is impossible—the limit allows for a dozen or so armored vehicles.

No matter what task the commanders set, we follow a template: stock up to the brim and rush to the target, overcoming resistance. There's no point in methodically ""clearing"" the map or executing clever maneuvers. The enemy's conveyor belt is just as efficient as ours, so the only way to take them is by force. Destroying the enemy's base or losing your own won't have any impact either—in a few seconds, our patrons will send replacements.

""Battles"" where two MCVs roll into a clearing and deploy ten meters apart look ridiculous. Tactics are reduced to choosing the right arguments: using lasers to penetrate heavy armor, setting air defenses on aircraft, etc. Capturing neutral objectives (automatic cannons, sensors that detect ""invisible"" aircraft) doesn't add any interest.

To liven up the sluggish wall-to-wall clashes, EA LA divided troops into three specializations. The first type of headquarters includes tanks, artillery, and commandos; the second includes infantry and defensive structures; the third includes aviation and a range of abilities that weaken the enemy and strengthen allies. The chosen direction can later be changed to a more suitable one.

However, evaluating all 90 units and buildings is not easy. Initially, the player is given a modest set of 3-4 types. Others will have to be unlocked by leveling up your account. Precious ""XP"" is awarded for main and intermediate missions, killing enemies, earning ""achievements,"" and winning online battles. This essentially good idea also suffered from poor implementation. Essentially, those who hadn't beaten the single-player mode were banned from engaging in online skirmishes. No amount of skill will save you if you're throwing soldiers in paper armor at machine guns.

Aside from the Mammoths and other ""fatties,"" there's not much to see at high levels—the artificially inflated selection is unimpressive. In [b]Tiberian Sun[/b] and [b]Tiberium Wars[/b], GDI and Nod had unique units, but in [b]C&C 4[/b], their differences are minimal. Perhaps the only difference is the different colored ""death rays.""

It's sad to see how the developers decided to put an end to the story. I believe they tried to make it better, simpler, more interesting, but it turned out absolutely unbearable – a profound blow to the fans and the entire series as a whole. A project with a boring process, disgusting multiplayer, a lopsided achievement system, and an absolutely hideous graphic style. A scrap of strategy, devoid not only of a supporting platform, but also of hope for the future."

Finalmente, después de investigar por mi cuenta pude finalizar la instalación, pero ojala que nunca hubiese funcionado. Nada más lejos de la jugabilidad que la saga me tenía acostumbrado... No existe la construcción de estructuras, no hay que recolectar recursos, tiene un nivel de población limitado y pequeño, la historia principal se fue por una tangente que tiene nada que ver con lo que se esperaba de acuerdo a la línea de su predecesor, sólo una base que genera todo, limitando la expansión estratégica ya que sólo puedes tener esa base y la desastrosa costumbre que están tomando las compañías de tener que estar siempre ""online"", que es un despropósito para partidas Single Player. Las cinemáticas siguen siendo buenas, tiene un sistema de upgrades que podría haber funcionado bien si el resto de la jugabilidad se hubiese mantenido, pero sumando y restando diría que es el peor título de la saga, como si tuviera foco para consola o ser jugado con un mando, perdiendo toda su esencia.

Наверное стоит рассказать, как я про нее вообще узнал. Точно не скажу, но было как то в журнале ""Игромания"" упоминание о разработке данной игры, рассказывали о том, что будет Самой красивой RTS. О новой фишке- Краулерах (Самоходный сборочный цех, который не строил здания, а производил войска прямо внутри себя, и что самое главное, мог оказывать поддержку и постоять за себя). Звучало для юного меня очень заманчиво. Но что насторожило, это отсутствие  кристала Тибериума (или Тиберия, как вам удобнее). Ни на одном скрине ничего не было. Зато писали про ""СКТ"". Что это, не ясно. и дата релиза был в 2010.
Но у нас  в Москве я лично ее нигде не видел, и с где то пару месяцев поисков вздохнул и играл дальше в Tiberian Sun. Но толи в 2012ом году, толи в 2013 ом, когда был ивент в Стиме с угольками под новый год , друг один решил мне сделать приятное, и подогнал ее. Я был в диком восторге, ведь это она, та самая игра, о котором я читал несколько лет назад в журнале! Подарив ему в ответ ..  я не помню что.., я поспешил устанавливать..
Что первое встречало рядового игрока, это окошко логина. Косо смотря на нее, я зарегистрировался впервые у электронщиков, выбрал себе ник и не задумываясь ни о мультиплеере, ни о настройках. Я сразу хотел приступить к кампании за моих любимчиков , братства НОД.
Но тебя заставляли играть в занудную обучалку за GDI. С другой стороны было приятно смотреть на все те же видеовставки, с живыми актерами. Правда сюжет... ммм... Даже не знаю, сейчас про него говорить, или позже.. Хотя нет, не могу.
Вначале вам покажут, что на нашей планете спустя несколько лет, после третьей тиберевой , наступил полный п*здец- уровень заражения тиберием достиг крит. отметки, жить невозможно. Совет GDI уже не знают что делать (ХОТЯ НЕТ, Я СДЕРЖИВАТЬСЯ ТУТ НЕ НАМЕРЕН! ЧТО БЛ*ТЬ МЕШАЕТ ПРОСТО ПОНАСТРОИТЬ ХАРВЕСТЕРОВ И ПРОСТО СОБИРАТЬ И ПЕРЕРАБАТЫВАТЬ ЕГО? НАЧИНАЯ С ПЕРВОЙ ЧАСТИ ЭТОТ ВОПРОС МЕНЯ НЕ УНИМАЛСЯ, ОНИ ТАМ ЧТО, ТРИЖДЫ КЕЙНА КОГДА УБИВАЛИ РАЗЛИЧНЫМИ СПОСОБАМИ ПРОСТО В ГАРАЖАХ ОТСТАВЛЯЛИ И СМОТРЕЛИ КАК ПЛАНЕТА РАЗРАСТАЛАСЬ ЗЕЛЕНЫМ ДЕРЬМОМ??), но к ним ВНЕЗАПНО на транспортном корабле выходит сам Кейн, ибо он жив, цел, орел, и говорит ""Джентельмены , у меня есть план!"" и показывает Тацит (За который во втором тиберьевом мы чуть ли не глотки драли , дабы забрать у них же и у обезумевшего КАБАЛа, ну да х*й с ним).Проходит время, и сотрудничая с Пророком, инженеры смогли построить СКТ , что переводится как Сеть Контроля Тиберия. Эта конструкия позволяла не давать кристаллам разрастаться как крапива на вашем заднем дворе и в тоже время собирать с них полезные ресурсы. И вроде вот, наступило светлое будущее, уровень заражения сильно упал, пошла растительность, людской народ спасен. Но Сепаратистам Гидеона, что откололись от братства, считали это ересью, и что кейн просто поехал с катушек, ибо это противоречело планам изначального (С этой стороны он прав, ведь на протяжении трех игр, мы занимались тем, чтобы засрать всю планету тиберием, дабы человечество познала истину.. ну или что то типа того. Правда в третьей игре все это было нужно , чтобы вызвать пришельцев, чтобы они понаставили своих врат, но я что то улетел от темы). Мы, как новый командующий армией GDI, должны были сопроводить караван, в котором находился сам пророк. После уничтожения  засад, он нам говорил что мы еще встретимся. И Внезапно после отбития узла СКТ, происходит взрыв, который нас грубо говоря вырубает. Нас поднимает наша Жена с стоящим сзади охранником, и беспокоится за нас, и хочет чтобы мы были с ней. и тут нам дают выбор, или мы идем за пророком, или за генералом Дейвиз (О котором нигде толком ничего не было, но если вкратце, то она поехавшая на всю катушку баба. Она потеряла при вторжении Скриннов свою семью. И во всем винит как раз Пророка). Я больше считаю каноничным сюжет за НОД. Почему? Там больше раскрывается сюжет , ибо если выбрать генерала, то Дейвиз на протяжении ВСЕХ миссии будет гонятся за ним, насрав на приказы командования, насрав на своих подчиненных. Она. Хочет. Убить. Кейна! И в конце это у нее получается! Вот только не совсем..
Выбрав сторону Нод, нужно отбить город от Сепаратистов Гидеона, которые устроили бунт, сжигая город дотла. Вот незадача, а GDI  нас не приветствует тут, да и наша жена тут. Вроде мы ее спасли, а вроде.. вдруг откуда ни возьмись и ракетой по транспорту зацепили. Тела нет. Вроде навевают грусть, но тебе как то пох*й. затем мы отбивает у одновременно у GDI и Гидеона несколько СКТ, и в один момент, когда мы приближались к нужной целе, Кейну не понравилось, что за нами по пятам шла Джейвиз. Он приказал убить. Мы как то сомневаемся, и внезапно он показывает что у нее наша жена. Жива и здорова. Как? Меня спрашиваешь?? ОТКУДА МНЕ ЗНАТЬ! ТАМ ТАКАЯ БАНДУРИНА ВЛЕТЕЛА, ЧТО МОКРОГО МЕСТА БЫ НЕ ОСТАВИЛО, но если мы хотим ее увидеть живой, то мы должны уничтожить  бывшего начальника. Говоришь х*йня вопрос, бать. и с горем пополам уничтожаешь Ох*еть огроменный корабль. Он реально огромный. 
После убийства, вновь посылают за СКТ, но вот незадача : Гидеон мразь, и прознал про то, что для работы с Скт нужны имплантанты, вживленные в 5 человек. 4ых он уже кокнул. ""Остался последний"" С ехидной улыбкой говорит нам в камеру. Кейн Ох как забеспокоился что его план летит к чертям, и устроил подмену лица.. и тела. ""Без лица, фильм второй""!
Затем мы от лица Кейна сначала взломали  Краулер, в котором находились координаты убежища Гидеона, в следующем мы должны были его захватить.. Я ненавижу эту миссию. контроль точек , которые нельзя было отдавать врагу, или он сдохнет, что Не нравилось Кейну, ибо тогда он будет мучеником, а это выставит Пророка в худшем свете. Захватив его и выступив перед публикой за него, мы получили пулю в грудь. Угоняем Краулер у GDI , пытаемся смотаться из этого дерьма, ибо тут начинается кровавое веселье меж GDI  и NOD , ведь братья нас не признают своим , ведь мы в чужом краулере.
А под конец эпичное противостояние меж нами, братьями и GDI, ведь нам нужно запустить  башню Скриннов. До Них наконец дошло что мы творим какую то ахинею, и пытаются нас остановить, но тщетно. ВНЕЗАПНО прилетает Дейвис, которая все же выжила, и орет в духе ""ТЫ НЕ ПРОЙДЕШЬ!"" и с пафосным роликом , где она одной бомбой уничтожает краулер. Без особого труда (ибо это вам не захват контрольных точек!) мы ее уничтожаем.
в финале показывают ролик, как мы вместе с Кейном открываем портал, но эта тварь все еще жива. какого х*я? ДА ПОНЯТИЯ НЕ ИМЕЮ, ЧТО ДО*БАЛСЯ? Дейвис стреляет в нас, считая что мы Кейн. Но он хватает ее и начинается махач. Мы кое как открываем портал.. и умираем. После этого рассказывают что Пророк вместе с тысячими последователи шагнули во врата и их никто больше не видел. Вроде наконец и хеппиэнд, а вроде...как то хз.
Как видно, игра сюжетом не блещет и создает много противоречий.
Картинка на то время и правда была прекрасной, меня впечатляла, особенно детализация самих пехотинцев. Красивые выстрелы тяжелых пехотинцев, взрывы смачные.
Музыка лично мне ох как нравится, особенно тема у НОД. Но почему такие отрицательные рецензии и оценки?
Первая причина- Это не C&C. Это МОБА. Внезапно. Из за отстуствия кристаллов как ресурс, мы не тратим ресурсы на создание воиск. Они вылезают с краулера, который считается как ""Герой"". Сами боевые действия выглядят так. Видишь врага? Становишься перед ним, по кд нажимаешь на производство, и стараешься задавить врага. Забавно выглядит бой меж двумя краулерами, которые впритык к друг к другу стоят.
Вторая причина- Гринд. в RTS. Да , ты меня правильно понял. Чтобы получить доступ к шикарным юнитам, тебе нужно качать свое звание. За одну миссию можно получить два уровня. А тебе нужно получить 20 званий, дабы стать самым крутым командиром на районе. Итого тебе нужно потратить грубо говоря 8 часов нудного гринда на одной, мать его миссии (Город в огне, или как то так)
Не все влезло, так что остальное будет в комментариях","[h1] Ah, Tiberium Twilight (or as we decided to call it, ""Epilogue""). I don't even know where to begin... [/h1]
Perhaps I should tell you how I even heard about it. I can't say for sure, but there was a mention of this game's development in Igromania magazine, and they talked about it being the most beautiful RTS. They talked about a new feature—Crawlers (a self-propelled assembly plant that didn't construct buildings, but produced troops directly within itself, and, most importantly, could provide support and defend itself). It sounded very tempting to my young self. But what alarmed me was the lack of a Tiberium crystal (or Tiberium, whichever you prefer). There wasn't a single screenshot of it. Instead, they wrote about ""SKT."" What that is, I'm not sure. And the release date was 2010.
But here in Moscow, I personally hadn't seen it anywhere, and after about a couple of months of searching, I sighed and continued playing Tiberian Sun. But either in 2012 or 2013, during a Steam event with embers for the New Year, a friend decided to do me a favor and sent me the game. I was overjoyed, because it was it, the very game I'd read about in a magazine a few years ago! Having given him... I don't remember what... in return, I rushed to install it.
The first thing the average player saw was the login window. Looking askance at it, I registered for the first time with the electronics team, chose a nickname, and didn't think about multiplayer or settings. I immediately wanted to start the campaign for my favorites, the Brotherhood of Nod.
But you were forced to play a boring tutorial for GDI. On the other hand, it was nice to watch those same cutscenes, with live actors. The plot, though... hmmm... I don't even know whether to talk about it now or later. Actually, no, I can't.
First, they'll show you that our planet, a few years after the third Tiberium War, is in total disarray—the Tiberium contamination level has reached critical levels, making it impossible to live. The GDI council doesn't know what to do anymore (NO, I'M NOT HOLDING BACK HERE! WHAT THE FUCK IS PREVENTING THEM FROM JUST BUILDING HARVESTERS AND JUST COLLECTING AND PROCESSING IT? THIS QUESTION HAS BEEN BEING ON ME SINCE THE FIRST PART, DID THEY JUST LEAVE KAIN IN THEIR GARAGES THREE TIMES WHEN THEY KILLED IT IN VARIOUS WAYS AND WATCH THE PLANET GROW IN GREEN SHIT??), but SUDDENLY Kane himself appears on a transport ship, alive and well, and says, ""Gentlemen, I have a plan!"" And Tacitus shows up (which we practically fought for in the second Tiberium War, trying to take back from them and the crazed Cabal, but fuck it). Time passes, and, collaborating with the Prophet, the engineers were able to build the Tiberium Control Network (TCN), which translates as the Tiberium Control Network. This design allowed the crystals to be kept from growing like nettles in your backyard while simultaneously harvesting useful resources from them. And so, a bright future seemed to have arrived, the infection rate had dropped significantly, vegetation had begun to grow, and the human race was saved. But Gideon's Separatists, who had broken away from the Brotherhood, considered this heresy, and that Kane had simply lost his mind because it contradicted the original plan. (In this respect, he's right; for three games, we've been busy polluting the entire planet with Tiberium so that humanity would learn the truth... or something like that. True, in the third game, all this was needed to summon the aliens so they could set up their gates, but I'm getting a bit off topic.) We, as the new commander of the GDI army, were supposed to escort a caravan containing the prophet himself. After destroying the ambushes, he told us that we would meet again. And suddenly, after retaking the SCT node, an explosion occurs, which, to put it bluntly, knocks us out. Our Wife, with a guard standing behind her, wakes us up; she's worried about us and wants us with her. And then we're given a choice: either follow the Prophet or General Davis (whom we've never really heard about, but in short, she's a total loser. She lost her family in the Scrin invasion. And she blames the Prophet for everything). I think the Nod side's storyline is more canon. Why? It reveals more of the plot, because if you choose the General, Davis will spend the ENTIRE mission chasing him, ignoring orders from her superiors, ignoring her own subordinates. She. Wants. To. Kill. Kane! And in the end, she succeeds! Except not quite...
Having chosen the Nod side, we need to recapture the city from Gideon's Separatists, who have staged a riot, burning it to the ground. Unfortunately, GDI isn't welcoming us here, and neither is our wife. We seem to have saved her, but then... out of nowhere, a missile hits the transport. No body. They seem sad, but you don't really give a shit. Then we recapture several SKTs from both GDI and Gideon, and at one point, as we were approaching our target, Kane didn't like the fact that Javees was hot on our heels. He ordered a kill. We were kind of dubious, and then he suddenly revealed that she had our wife. Alive and well. What? You're asking me? HOW SHOULD I KNOW! SOMEONE WENT IN THERE THAT WOULD HAVE LEFT A WET PLACE, but if we want to see her alive, we have to destroy our former boss. You say it's a piece of crap, dad. And with great difficulty, you destroy a fucking huge ship. It's really huge.
After the assassination, they send for the SCT again, but here's the problem: Gideon is a scumbag, and he found out that working with the SCT requires implants implanted in five people. He's already killed the fourth. ""One last one left,"" he tells us into the camera with a sly smile. Kane was terribly worried that his plan was going to hell, so he arranged a face swap... and a body swap. ""Face/Off, movie two!""
Then, as Kane, we hacked the Crawler containing the coordinates of Gideon's hideout. The next mission was to capture him... I hate this mission. Controlling points that couldn't be given to the enemy, or they'd die. Kane didn't like it, because then he'd be a martyr, and that would paint the Prophet in a worse light. After capturing him and publicly defending him, we got shot in the chest. We steal a GDI crawler and try to escape this mess, because a bloodbath between GDI and NOD begins, because the brothers don't recognize us as their own, since we're in someone else's crawler.
And then there's an epic confrontation between us, the brothers, and GDI, because we need to get the Scrin tower up and running. They finally realize we're doing something stupid and are trying to stop us, but to no avail. SUDDENLY, Davis, who survived after all, flies in and screams something like ""YOU SHALL NOT PASS!"" and a pompous cutscene where she destroys the crawler with a single bomb. We destroy it without much difficulty (because this isn't a control point capture!)

The final cutscene shows Kane and I opening a portal, but that thing is still alive. What the f*ck? I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE F*CK IS THAT? Davis shoots at us, thinking we're Kane. But he grabs her and a brawl ensues. We somehow manage to open the portal... and die. Afterwards, they say the Prophet, along with thousands of followers, stepped through the gates and was never seen again. It seems like a happy ending, finally, but then again... Who knows.
Apparently, the game doesn't shine with its plot and creates a lot of contradictions.
The graphics were truly beautiful at the time; I was impressed, especially the detail of the infantry themselves. Beautiful shots from the heavy infantry, delicious explosions.
Personally, I really like the music, especially the NOD theme. But why such negative reviews and ratings?
The first reason is: This isn't a C&C. It's a MOBA. Unexpectedly. Due to the lack of crystals as a resource, we don't spend resources on creating troops. They emerge from a crawler, which counts as a ""Hero."" The combat itself looks like this. See the enemy? Stand in front of them, press production on cooldown, and try to crush them. A fight between two crawlers right next to each other is funny.
The second reason is grinding in RTS. Yes, you heard me correctly. To gain access to awesome units, you need to level up your rank. You can gain two levels in one mission. And you need 20 ranks to become the coolest commander in the area. So, you'll need to spend roughly 8 hours of tedious grinding on one goddamn mission (City on Fire, or something like that).
I didn't fit everything, so the rest will be in the comments."

- quality over quantity: you can't build hundreds of units (there are points as a limit system, their maximum depends on player's profile level) so you really have to be more tactical, keep them alive so they become veterans, use their special abilities

Познакомился с этой серией я в далеком 2000, с Command & Conquer: Tiberium sun, это было что-то с чем-то, шедевр, легенда, прошедшая проверку временем. Затем появился не плохой, но без яиц Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium wars. 
А потом пришло оно, в 2010, назвать это игр.. иг.. игро…й, этот  кусок гов#а, язык не поворачивается. Поиграл, охр#нел, и удалил. Спустя почти 5 лет, я решил все же пройти историю Command & Conquer до конца. Интересно, что стало с Кейном, GDI,NOD, тибериумом в целом. Как раз в steam’е продавалась вся серия C&C со скидкой. Купил, повторно прошел C&C  Tiberium wars, C&C Red alert 3, и забил. Прошло еще около 4 лет, и я вновь собрался с силами. 
И тут началось, регистрация на сайте ЕА, регистрация в магазине ЕА, регистрация регистрации. Пройдя всю бюрократию, в ведя имя профиля, введя пароль, ведя что-то там еще, игра под конец просит ввести код активации. КАКОЙ НА Х#Й КОД? Подсказка объясняет, что код, на обратной стороне коробки. КАКЯ БЛ#ДЬ КОРОБКА? или, вам должен был придти код на почту. КАКАЯ НА ХРЕН ПОЧТА, ДЕСЯТИ ЛЕТНЕЙ ДАВНОСТИ? ИДИ#ТЫ. Код активации от steam, не подходит, можете забрать его себе, вот F8JJ-KRFH-UUHH-4CW9-GZHQ. Оказалось что ЕА обрубила все свои конченые сервера.    
И тут в глазах потемнело, вся ненависть к ЕА копившаяся на протяжении 20 лет вырвалась наружу. 
Держитесь…
Я всем сердцем ненавижу эту компанию этих, жадных, бездушных МУД#КОВ. Они скупают, велики студии, а затем паразитируют на их достижениях, при этом, как настоящие паразиты, они убивают своих носителей. Так поступили с Westwood studios. Мы все знаем, как обошлись с их наследием, и уж точно не забудем, как бы не старались ПИД#РАСЫ из ЕА, скрыть свое преступление, закрывая сервера twilight (ставить приставку C&C рядом с этой херо#добиной просто оскорбительно) 
Как они обошлись с Dead Space, хотя это и отчасти их продукт, но боже, как же, они дро#или собственных разработчиков, ставили им палки в колеса. И что в итоге, первая часть: всемирное признание, десятки наград, любовь фанатов. Но МУД#КАМ из ЕА нужно больше золота. В итоге …. Третья часть, и все сотрудники идут нах#й… Позор и Забытье.
А теперь эти ПИД#РМОТЫ добрались до ВЕЛИКОЙ BioWare. Кто в танке, это создатели первого Mass effect, Dragon Age: Origins, а для олдскулов, это создатели ВЕЛИКОГО Baldur's Gate. И что же мы имеем, а имеем мы мертвую BioWare, а из ее гниющего трупа, как чужой из груди, вылезает Mass effect: andromeda. А в это время ЕА имеет нас, и наш кошелек.  И таких примеров десятки. Вы понимаете размеры злодеяния этой ЗЛОЕБ#ЧЕЙ компании и нанесенного ею морального вреда фанатам.
Но если этих ХУ#СОС#В из ЕА еще можно как-то оправдать: алчность – надо купить крутую компанию, жадность – надо быстро выпустить го#ноигру, эгоизм – пофиг на людей, главное бабки.. бабки.. бабки… То, как можно оправдать игроков-ПИЗ#ЮКОВ, которые тащат свои кровные, или кровные своих родитель, что бы поддерживать существование этого БЛ#ДЬ паразита в игросфере. Которые, за чтобы не взялись, всё уничтожают, а если не уничтожат, то извратят, до неузнаваемости. Но ДОЛБОКЛОУНЫ готовы, не только покупать их ДЕРЬ#ОИГРЫ, но и сливать кучу денег, что бы, купить себе красивую зимнюю шапку с рогами как у оленя, для своего персонажа, может потому что вы и есть олени. 
В итоге, наследие игр, которые мы любили в детстве, уничтожено либо осквернено.  Компании их создавшие, поглощены и разорены. Люди причастные к созданию великих шедевров, вложившие свою душу и сердце, сейчас чуть ли не подвергнуты гонению. ЕА, это как 3-й рейх в игроиндустрии, который либо всех поглотит либо уничтожит, и вместо того что бы с ним бороться, вы поддерживаете его существование, засылая свои кровные.Остановитесь.

 P.S. Эх, Westwood, Westwood, прости нас, мы всё проср#ли.","Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight – I really hope the creators of this product get a real run for their money.

I first encountered this series back in 2000 with Command & Conquer: Tiberium Sun. It was something else, a masterpiece, a legend that has stood the test of time. Then came the not-bad, but lacking in substance, Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars.

And then, in 2010, it came along. I can't bring myself to call this piece of sh#t a game... a game. I played it, was shocked, and deleted it. Almost five years later, I've finally decided to finish the Command & Conquer story. I wonder what happened to Kane, GDI, NOD, and Tiberium in general. The entire C&C series was on sale on Steam at the time. I bought it, replayed C&C Tiberium Wars, C&C Red Alert 3, and then gave up. About four years passed, and I finally got my act together.
And then it all started: registering on the EA website, registering in the EA store, registering. After going through all the paperwork, entering my profile name, entering my password, and doing some other stuff, the game finally asks for an activation code. WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS CODE? The prompt explains that the code is on the back of the box. WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS BOX? Or, you should have received the code in your email. WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS MAIL, TEN YEARS OLD? FUCK YOU. The Steam activation code doesn't work, you can keep it for yourself, here it is: F8JJ-KRFH-UUHH-4CW9-GZHQ. Turns out EA shut down all their fucking servers.
And then my eyes darkened, and all the hatred for EA that had been pent up for 20 years burst forth.
Hang in there...
I hate this company of greedy, heartless MORONS with all my heart. They buy up big studios, and then profit off their achievements, while, like true parasites, they kill their owners. That's what they did to Westwood Studios. We all know how they treated their legacy, and we certainly won't forget how hard the FAGGOTs at EA tried to cover up their crime by shutting down Twilight's servers (putting the C&C console next to this piece of crap is simply insulting).
How they treated Dead Space? Even though it was partly their product, oh my God, they fucked up their own developers, throwing spokes in their wheels. And what's the result, the first game: worldwide recognition, dozens of awards, the love of fans. But the MORONS at EA need more gold. In the end... The third part, and all the employees can go to hell... Shame and oblivion.
And now these faggots have gotten to the GREAT BioWare. Those who don't care, these are the creators of the first Mass Effect, Dragon Age: Origins, and for the old-schoolers, these are the creators of the GREAT Baldur's Gate. And so what do we have? We have a dead BioWare, and from its rotting corpse, like an alien from the chest, emerges Mass Effect: Andromeda. Meanwhile, EA has us, and our wallets. And there are dozens of such examples. You understand the scale of this FUCKING company's atrocity and the moral damage it has inflicted on its fans. But if these EA assholes can somehow be justified: greed – they need to buy a cool company, avarice – they need to quickly release a shitty game, selfishness – they don't care about people, the main thing is money... money... money... How can you justify the f#cked-up gamers who spend their hard-earned money, or their parents' hard-earned money, to support the existence of this F#CKING parasite in the gaming industry. Who, no matter what they do, destroy everything, and if they don't destroy it, they'll distort it beyond recognition. But these MORONCLOWNS are ready not only to buy their SHIT GAMES, but also to waste tons of money to buy themselves a nice winter hat with deer antlers for their character, maybe because they are deer. 
As a result, the legacy of the games we loved as children is destroyed or desecrated. The companies that created them have been absorbed and ruined. The people involved in creating these great masterpieces, who poured their hearts and souls into them, are now practically persecuted. EA is like the Third Reich of the gaming industry, one that will either swallow everyone up or destroy them, and instead of fighting it, you're supporting its existence by sending in your hard-earned money. Stop it.

P.S. Oh, Westwood, Westwood, forgive us, we've fucked everything up."

Not to mention that the graphics of Last Twilight are not as good as the previous one, and the game system has been changed beyond recognition. If you are selling on Steam, you should be more Steam-like. Why do you have to log in with an EA account to buy games on Steam? What is your purpose in selling on Steam? To cheat people out of money and then leave? Then you have to let everyone play the game first before you run away. How can people spend money if they can’t even enter the game? In short, that’s it."

一个rts游戏变成了类似打怪升级的游戏。新手进去由于级别太低，单位都解锁不了，只能一堆一级兵打人家满级兵。。。。这还打个屁。我战役连第一关都过的非常吃力，低等级50人口的一级普通兵，打人家茫茫多的满级高级兵，任务是保护平民逃难车，对手nod两个兵营处茫茫多的高级兵种，而我只有初级兵种。我想游戏设计之处肯定是瞅准了花钱升级这个点，否则级别高的玩家纯粹就是虐杀低等级玩家。

可怜正版玩家了。电脑无限爆各种高级兵种，而你只有可怜的5种低级兵，人口锁定50，面对电脑若干兵营爆出大量的兵。完全没法打，打就是添油战，，只能是换同等数量对面兵，不打就是被对手不断爆兵到一定数量一波消灭。一局游戏，打了1个小时，还是原地踏步，完全的焦灼，没有任何出路。什么rts，任何战略都用不到，就是机械的防守就完了。

从没见过如此恐怖的RTS游戏！！","You must be online the entire time, otherwise you'll be automatically logged out. Server stability is mediocre and intermittent.
And then: This isn't a competitive game!
An RTS game has become more like a monster-killing and leveling game. New players enter at too low a level, unable to unlock any units, leaving them with a bunch of level 1 soldiers against the enemy's max-level soldiers... That's a crap fight. I struggled even through the first level of the campaign, with a low-level, 50-person population of level 1 soldiers, fighting against a vast army of max-level, high-level soldiers. My mission was to protect a civilian escape vehicle. The enemy Nod had two barracks with a plethora of high-level troops, while I only had basic troops. I think the game design must have targeted the need to spend money on upgrades; otherwise, high-level players would simply overwhelm low-level players.

Pity the legitimate players. The computer churns out endless high-level troops, while you only have five low-level troops, your population is locked at 50, and you're facing a massive blast of troops from the computer's several barracks. It's completely impossible to fight. Fighting is just a tug-of-war, with only an equal number of enemy troops to exchange for. If I don't fight, the enemy will just keep spawning enough troops to wipe them out in a single wave. One game lasted an hour, and I was still stuck. It was completely stagnant, with no way out. What RTS? No strategy at all, just mechanical defense.

- too shallow for an MMO game
- too shallow for a C&C game

TL,DR: just leave it alone. Really, don't bother

This game is marred by bad design from the start.
 
It forces you to play online, YET it won't start, unless you log onto Origin, and add your CD key. Even after that, you must make numerous login attempts to play.

It forces you to play single player campaign, YET the story is a complete mess. I never felt so disappointed in my life playing a C&C campaign. Reading the reviews I thought it can't be that bad. Guess what, it's worse... Just watch the outro video on YT, and you'll see what I mean.

It tries to be c&c only in its name. It is basically a small-squad-tactics game, sprinkled with minimal special abilities for units. Oh, and said units are boring as HELL. I have 12 hours behind my back, but I couldn't tell the difference between a Zone Trooper and a Zone Enforcer with a gun at my head.

It attempts to be the herald on the MMO era with its ""fast"" pace, but it also falls flat. Dammit, who designed the hotkeys? SHIFT+F5 for a unit construction? Geez... Also, even basic design attempts are failing. Like, I delpoy a Zone Lancer gunner, and then select a new one by double-clicking on it. If I press the deploy hotkey, the newly selected ones deploy, while the deployed ones undeploy... good luck managing that in the midst of battle.

All in all, be glad if you couldn't start that one - nothing can give you back the time you would've wasted on that garbage.","+ runs well on older computers

Если кто не догадался: портал скриннов был сломан, а сеть контроля тиберия лишила инопланетян стратегического преимущества (хотя ясно, что разработчики просто поленились придумать игру, в которой уникальной внеземной расе вновь нашлось бы достойное место); Кейн - бывший император скриннов в изгнании либо ещё более мощное существо, уже его имя позволяет догадаться, что библейский Каин, сына Адама и Евы, первый убийца (жертва-родной брат Авель) - самое раннее описание главы братства НОД. Перед финальной миссией Кейн намекает главному герою, что ему надоело несколько тысяч лет сидеть на планете Земля (началось всё в пустыне) и развлекаться с людьми, пытаясь управлять развитием их технологий, поэтому он запускает портал в башне скриннов и вместе с братством уматывает домой  по своим делам.","The game is good in the sense intended by the localizer through literary translation: an epilogue. Considering the discounted price of concluding the Command and Conquer series story, the game looks excellent. On its own, it's perhaps comparable to Dawn of War 3 conceptually (it has a MOBA feel, reeks of IceFrog; fortunately, the arena-like maps are the only similarity to the Dota family; otherwise, it's similar to the Dawn of War series - control of victory points) and Dawn of War 2 in content (a small unit limit, one building produces all troops) and graphics. Beautiful explosion effects, superb design and a huge variety of units, a considerable set of buildings, but only one multiplayer mode on a handful of generally similar maps. P.S. I'm amazed why people on YouTube complain that all the secrets of the series weren't revealed in this game. Major spoilers follow. In case anyone hasn't guessed: the Scrinn portal was broken, and the Tiberium control network deprived the aliens of their strategic advantage (though it's clear the developers were simply too lazy to come up with a game that would once again give this unique extraterrestrial race a worthy place). Kane is either a former Scrinn emperor in exile or an even more powerful being; his name alone suggests that the biblical Cain, son of Adam and Eve, the first murderer (his victim being his brother Abel), is the earliest description of the leader of the Brotherhood of Nod. Before the final mission, Kane hints to the protagonist that he's tired of sitting on planet Earth for several thousand years (it all started in the desert) and messing around with humans, trying to control the development of their technology. So he launches a portal in the Scrinn tower and, along with the Brotherhood, heads off home to do their own thing."

- Well, after almost 10 years of bad RTS games or no RTS games available at all on the gaming market, I replayed all the series of Command & Conquer and I must say I truly enjoyed playing them for like the seventh time. I could never get from any other recent RTS the same exceptionally good feeling I got in the C&C or Starcraft series.
- If you played the rest of the games in the franchise, you will find this one disconcerting and strange, because the game mechanics are not at all what are you used to.
- Nevertheless, once you master the new mechanisms and accept the fact that spots holding and points counting will make the game shorter than expected or desired, you can still have fun in the game.
- The joy I received from the franchise over the years is the only reason I gave C&C 4 a thumbs-up, since this game had a very unfortunate fate due to the mixed-up system they changed instead of keeping the good old (and proved) game mechanics in the series.
- Still, for an RTS fan, the game was  a must-play marker and can still be enjoyed even in 4K.

其实这款游戏做的很好，音乐非常好听，手感也不错，节奏很快，一打起来非常的热闹

玩法像是命令与征服和英雄连抢点玩法的结合，防御组的玩法很像红警3的TR战术，支援组的飞机也很帅气，后期的大战舰非常的霸气，游戏的血量可以自己设置，游戏其实很好玩。

新玩家不要听信那些所谓的“命令与征服老粉丝”的话，这款游戏很值得一玩，我每一部命令与征服都很喜欢，并且命令与征服全系列的对战我都仔细玩过，真正喜欢命令与征服的玩家是不会跟风黑这款游戏的。

This game is actually very well made. The music is beautiful, the gameplay feels good, and the pace is fast. It's really exciting once you get going.

The gameplay is like a combination of Command & Conquer and Company of Heroes' point-grabbing gameplay. The defense team's gameplay is very similar to the TR tactics in Red Alert 3. The support team's aircraft are also very cool. The late-game battleships are very impressive. You can customize your health bar. The game is actually very fun.

New players, don't listen to the so-called ""old Command & Conquer fans."" This game is worth playing. I love every Command & Conquer game and have thoroughly played all the battles in the series. True Command & Conquer fans won't follow the trend and criticize this game.

Although I was confused and puzzled when I first opened this game in an internet cafe many years ago, I think back to it many years later and find it surprisingly fun.

EA的帐号注册是真的不友好。
新游戏模式不是不能适应，也确实有他的亮点。但是真的不！好！玩！
画面说不上比3进步到哪里去，相比之下至少红3都还有游戏性弥补。
剧情……没认真玩，时间都用在遭遇战练级上了，不做评价。
绝大部分时候有3就不想搓4，3玩得腻得不行了后才会考虑玩4换换口味，然后光速后悔。

EA's account registration system is truly unfriendly.
The new game mode isn't unplayable, and it certainly has its highlights. But it's truly not! Good! Playable!
The graphics aren't a huge improvement over 3. At least Red 3 makes up for it in gameplay.
As for the story... I didn't really play it; I spent all my time leveling up in skirmishes, so I can't comment on it.
Most of the time, I don't want to play 4 when I have 3. Only after I get tired of 3 do I consider 4 for a change, and then I quickly regret it.
Because the games I played were so male-oriented, I didn't have many close gaming friends growing up. At least through this, I've met some like-minded people.

And oh my god, I was just blown away. I don't know how they could screw up the franchise like this. A game without Tiberium is simply pointless. They used to give you 10,000 Tiberium (on average) at the start of each mission, and you knew that either you set up a starting base and use the outpost to capture another storage depot, or the mission was lost. In this part of the game, you just right-click to churn out troops. I played through the entire GDI campaign with just one class, and there's absolutely no strategy in the game. Even the cutscenes after each mission look like crap compared to previous installments in the franchise. The list of downsides is endless. Simple advice: don't buy this garbage, especially on Steam, where it doesn't even run reliably. And if you still want to play despite all the negative reviews, Origin is your friend; buy it there."

Steam bietet in diesem Fall keine Hilfe und verweist auf den EA Kundensupport der den Support für genau dieses Game Eingestellt zu haben scheint, somit ist es nicht möglich dieses Game auf legalem weg zu Spielen, ein Keygenerator könnte hier vermutlich Abhilfe schaffen, aber da ich solche Programme nicht nutze bleibt dieses Spiel wohl für immer ausserhalb meiner Reichweite.

Edit: Habe das Problem mit dem nicht Funktionierendem Key gelöst, Ihr müsst euch über euren Browser in euer bereits bestehendes EA Konto Einloggen oder ein Konto eröffnen,          

Ihr klickt dann folgendes: Konto Verwalten ---> Code Einlösen, jetzt den Code hier Eintippen oder Reinkopieren,  Wiedeholt auf next klicken bis Key Akzeptiert wurde.

Steam Starten (wenn bereits aktiviert dann neustart machen), C&C4 starten und im folgenden EA Bildschirm normal Einloggen und dann spiel Starten ohne den Key erneut eingeben zu müssen, fertig ;)

Der Daumen bleibt aber trotzdem unten weil C&C4 für mich das schlechteste aus der ganzen Reihe ist, und es keinen Neutralen Daumen gibt :D","Although this game is so different from the other installments in the C&C series (only available on PC), there's something about it that makes you want to dig it out of the shadows after a few years and play it again, were it not for the additional online registration process that, after creating your account or logging in with your old credentials, requires a registration key that no longer works despite repeated entry.

Steam offers no help in this case and refers you to EA Customer Support, which seems to have discontinued support for this very game. Therefore, it's not possible to play this game legally. A key generator could probably help, but since I don't use such programs, this game will probably remain out of my reach forever.

Edit: I've solved the problem with the non-working key. You need to log in to your existing EA account via your browser or create a new one.

Then click on the following: Manage Account ---> Redeem Code. Now type or copy and paste the code here. Click Next repeatedly until the key is accepted.

Start Steam (if already activated, restart), start C&C4, and log in normally on the following EA screen. Then start the game without having to enter the key again. Done ;)

But the thumbs still stay down because C&C4 is the worst of the entire series for me, and there's no such thing as a neutral thumbs-up :D"

However, my greatest disappointment is with the gameplay.

1. Limited population - you can only build 6-7 medium units + 2-4 engineers for repairs. By no means are you able to fully balance out your units and deploy your strategy effectively and every battle becomes a micro management nightmare.

2. Lack of resouce management - to me part of the beauty of past C&C (or any RTS for that matter) is the effective use of limited resource. In this game, you are given unlimited resource to build any amount of units, only constraint being the miserable pop cap in point 1. Half the time in this game you are just spamming cheap cannon fodder units without a care to their surviveabilty.

3. MCV - 3 MCV types that you have to select at start of game and each with their specific units / buildings. For example, you can only build defensive structure if you select the defense MCV and only tank units if you select the offense MCV. To change MCV type mid game you have to basically deconstruct your existing MCV and select a new type. And you can only land it on specific zones! This is a major PITA for me, why can't we have the option to build up my base defense even if my strategy is tank based? 

4. Upgrade path - you can only gain access to certain units / abilities after leveling up and even at end game stage you will not have access to the best units / abilities, even after finishing all the side quests. While this by no means stops you from completing the game, it does not offer you the best experience (unless you are willing to replay completed missions to earn extra exp). The best example is perhaps the final mission for NOD, where you have to destroy a GDI battleship, which basically 2 hits all your basic units. I remember spamming the basic units till the miserable pop cap, watching them shave 4-5%  off the GDI battleship and then dying in less than 3 sec, and then repeat ad naseum.

Overall, this game seems to be a weak & sad attempt by EA to milk a dying cow and is an utter embarrassment to the original C&C.

To kolejny gigantyczny plus. Grafika na najwyższych wymaganiach jest starannie dociągnięta do najdrobniejszych elementów, co daje wspaniały rezultat wizualny. Jednak wiadomo, że za idealną jakością tekstur idzie odpowieni sprzęt komputerowy.

[b]Muzyka[/b]

Zaprezentowane utwory w przedstawionym produkcie są dobrze dopasowane względem rozgrywki. Oczywiście utwory zmieniają się względem napięcia akcji, co idealnie nastraja gracza do tematyki wojennej przedstawionego tytułu.

[b]Rozgrywka[/b]

Niestety tutaj nie można powiedzieć, że to mocna strona gry. Jeżeli chodzi o porównanie do poprzednich wersji to po prostu będzie niepoprawne, gdyż Command & Conquer 4 jest nastawiony głównie na grę multiplayer. Z każdą napotkaną grą ów serii C&C rozgrywka była dość banalna - zbierasz surowce, które wymieniane są na fundusze, budujesz bazę, werbujesz jednostki piechoty, bądź produkujesz zmechanizowane i starasz się wyeliminować przeciwnika wszelkimi dostępnymi środkami. Natomiast ta część odstaje od normy, gdyż do dyspozycji mamy (nie ważne czy w GDI, czy w NOD) 3 rodzaje budynków głównych. Ofensywny - charakteryzuje się tworzeniem głównie jednostek zmechanizowanych naziemnych, Defensywny - gdzie do werbunku możemy podjąć piechote, oraz Wsparcia - uruchamiając produkcję głównie jednostek latających. Im więcej bitew online, bądź offline rozegramy tym bardziej rośnie poziom naszego awatara, dzięki czemu możemy odblokować różnego rodzaju nowe jednostki, bądź ulepszenia. Tutaj rozgrywka jest ograniczona głównie do nacierania na przeciwnika, bez rozbudowywania flanki defensywnej, bądź bazy. Nie zbiera się surowców, które zapewniają fundusze na produkcję wojska, po prostu wybieramy jeden z trzech rodzajów ruchomego budynku głównego, produkujemy (za darmo)  takie wojsko jakie uważamy za słuszne i rozpoczynamy jak najszybszy atak. Największą wadą jest brak zaawansowanego wiersza poleceń, który mocno ułatwiłby rozgrywkę.

[b]Fabuła[/b]

Kane stara się za wszelką cenę dostąpić wniebowstąpienia, za pomocą wieży pozostawionej przez kosmiczą rasę scrinów. GDI za wszelką cenę stara się stłumić zamieszki spowodowane wysłannikami bractwa NOD i nie ma zamiaru pozwolić Kane'owi na spełnienie swojego celu, czy uda im się powstrzymać fanatycznego przywódcę bractwa?

[b]Reasumując, do plusów gry możemy zaliczyć:[/b]
[list]
[*]poprawność w sferze fabularnej
[*]czas potrzebny do zakończenia wątku
[*]mocno intensywną akcję podczas rozgrywki
[*]wciągającą fabułę
[*]innowacyjny pomysł rozgrywki, który mocno różni się od każdej poprzedniej części serii C&C.
[/list]
[b]Natomiast do ewidentnych minusów trzeba zaliczyć:[/b]
[list]
[*]strasznie wygórowaną cenę względem tego co oferuje produkt
[*]brak zaawansowanego wiersza poleceń, który ułatwiłby w wielu sytuacjach rozgrywkę
[*]bardzo uproszczoną rozgrywkę.
[/list]
[b]Moim zdaniem[/b]

Zaprezentowany produkt Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight jest tytułem godnym polecenia i wartym uwagi, po mimo tego, że rozgrywka nie jest świetna to fabuła i efekty specjalne, jak również i tempo akcji zaprezentowane przez twórców przechylają szalę tej części z serii C&C na pozytywną stronę.

[RECENZJA DO POPRAWEK ORTOGRAFICZNYCH I STYLISTYCZNYCH]","[h1]Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight[/h1]

This is a strategy game designed by EA Los Angeles and published by Electronic Arts in 2010. It tells the story of the global conflict between the Brotherhood of Nod and GDI.

[b]Game Engine[/b]

It's the game's strong point. It doesn't have any significant bugs worth mentioning. It's very well-polished.

[b]Graphics[/b]

This is another huge plus. The graphics, set to the highest requirements, are meticulously refined down to the smallest detail, resulting in a stunning visual result. However, it's clear that excellent texture quality requires adequate computer hardware.

[b]Music[/b]

The songs featured in this product are well-matched to the gameplay. Naturally, the songs change depending on the tension of the action, perfectly emphasizing the player's war-themed gameplay.

[b]Gameplay[/b]

Unfortunately, this isn't the game's strong point. Comparing it to previous versions would be simply inaccurate, as Command & Conquer 4 is primarily focused on multiplayer. With every game in the C&C series I've encountered, the gameplay has been fairly straightforward – you gather resources, which are exchanged for funds, build a base, recruit infantry units, or produce mechanized units, and try to eliminate the enemy by any means necessary. However, this installment differs from the norm, as we have three main building types at our disposal (regardless of whether in GDI or NOD). Offensive – characterized by the creation of primarily mechanized ground units, Defensive – where we can recruit infantry, and Support – which initiates the production of primarily air units. The more battles we play online or offline, the higher our avatar's level increases, allowing us to unlock various new units and upgrades. Here, gameplay is limited primarily to attacking the enemy, without developing a defensive flank or base. There are no resources to gather, which provide funds for military production; we simply choose one of three types of mobile main building, produce (for free) the troops we deem appropriate, and launch an attack as quickly as possible. The biggest drawback is the lack of an advanced command line, which would greatly simplify gameplay.

[b]Story[/b]

Kane is desperately trying to achieve ascension, using a tower left by the alien race of scrins. GDI is desperately trying to quell the riots caused by agents of the Brotherhood of Nod and has no intention of allowing Kane to fulfill his goal. Will they be able to stop the brotherhood's fanatical leader?

[b]In summary, the game's advantages include:[/b]
[list]
[*]accurate storyline
[*]time needed to complete the story
[*]highly intense gameplay
[*]engrossing plot
[*]innovative gameplay concept that differs significantly from any previous installment in the C&C series.
[/list]
[b]However, the obvious disadvantages include:[/b]
[list]
[*]terribly excessive price compared to what the product offers
[*]lack of an advanced command line, which would make gameplay easier in many situations
[*]very simplified gameplay. [/list]
[b]In my opinion[/b]

The presented product, Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight, is a title worth recommending and considering. Although the gameplay isn't great, the story and special effects, as well as the pace of the action presented by the developers, tip the scales of this installment in the C&C series in the positive direction.

Best regards,
Paweł

42006008,russian,2018.04.13 01:50,❌,✅,0.6786032915,18,"Очень сложно непредвзято оценить эту игру, являясь фанатом серии C&C (а не орать от увиденного матом на своего кота, потому что больше то и не на кого выместить всё негодование, но кот то и не при чем, и сидит он потом думает где же я опять нассал не так)

Главная фишка серии игр - живые видеоролики. С одной стороны, видеоролики в своём качестве стали на порядок выше, актёры начали по-настоящему играть, это уже больше не та клоунада как в порнушных роликах перед основным действом (вспомнить актёрскую игру из предыдущей части... Даже в убогих русских сериалах про ментов качество игры актёров лучше в гигалиарды раз). С другой стороны, совершенно ни капельки, ни грамулечки, ни песчиночки, ни ху яшечки не понятно что там вообще, мать того за ногу, происходит. Помимо этого, многие моменты настолько абсурдные и нелепые, что залезаешь в стим в поисках ДЛС к этой игре, по которому вам отсыпят немного дури, вкуренной в процессе написания сценария.

Может быть, это я такой придирчивый и невнимательный, допускаю, но я ни черта не понял сюжета, начиная с первого видеоролика, и заканчивая последним. Буду благодарен, если кто-то расскажет, что там на самом деле происходило.

Оценить геймплей в полной мере, возможно, мне помешает прохождение игры в одиночку. Как я понял, она рассчитана на кооп. Поэтому скажу только о своем опыте одиночной игры. [strike]ПОЛНОЕ ГОВ НИЩЕ[/strike] Геймплей довольно экспериментальный и необычный. Вместо типичной стратегии, к которой мы все привыкли, динамику боёв решили раскрутить, и лишили нас построек, базы, добычи ресурсов, штампования тысячного воинства и подобных плюшек, за которые мы любили C&C. Вместо этого, нам дали гигантскую черепашку, разрешили нон-стопом рожать из неё максимум 10-15 бойцов, которыми мы должны разруливать любой конфликт. Нет больше супер-оружия, нет масштабных боёв и харвестеров. Да и тиберий здесь нужен только чтобы его схватить, залететь с ним в руках в толпу врагов и подорваться. Сам по себе такой режим игры интересный, и к нему нет никаких претензий. Но игроки явно ожидали от C&C совсем не этого. Будь он каким-нибудь отдельным режимом игры, то проблем не было бы вообще никаких.

Дизайн. Графическая составляющая отступила на несколько шагов назад от предыдущей части. Юниты выглядят как игрушки из лего, сама графика стала более яркой и мультяшной (особенно спецэффекты), интерфейс стал максимально убогим, каким не был в этой серии игр вообще никогда. И если с ред алертом подобный дизайн игры прокатил, т.к. игра сама по себе является карикатурной и шутливой, то у серии тибериума совершенно другой посыл. Без шуток. Всё серьёзно. С игрушками из лего.

А вот саундтрек действительно порадовал. Многим не понравились ""цыганские завывания"" на фоне НОДов, а мне показалось это очень клёвым и уместным, учитывая, что эта группировка собралась как раз в этих странах. 

В итоге мы имеем игру среднего качества, которую загнала в могилу аббревиатура C&C. Не будь этой аббревиатуры, положительных обзоров было бы намного больше.","It's really hard to evaluate this game objectively as a C&C fan (and not yell obscenities at your cat after seeing it, because there's no one else to vent your anger on, and the cat has nothing to do with it, so he sits there wondering where I messed up again).

The main feature of the series is the lively cutscenes. On the one hand, the quality of the cutscenes has improved significantly, the actors have started to really act, it's no longer the clown act of pornographic videos before the main action (remember the acting in the previous game... Even in crappy Russian cop shows, the acting is far superior). On the other hand, it's completely unclear what the hell is going on there. Besides, many moments are so absurd and ridiculous that you'll find yourself browsing Steam looking for DLC for this game, only to be rewarded with some of the nonsense they've ingested while writing the script.

Maybe I'm just being picky and inattentive, I admit it, but I didn't understand a damn thing about the plot, from the first video to the last. I'd be grateful if someone could explain what actually happened.

Playing the game solo might prevent me from fully appreciating the gameplay. As far as I understand, it's designed for co-op. So, I'll only speak from my experience playing it solo. [strike]TOTAL GOSPEL[/strike] The gameplay is quite experimental and unusual. Instead of the typical strategy we're all accustomed to, they decided to ramp up the combat dynamics, depriving us of buildings, a base, resource extraction, churning out thousands of troops, and other perks that made us love C&C. Instead, we were given a giant turtle, allowed to constantly spawn a maximum of 10-15 fighters from it, with which we must resolve any conflict. There are no more super-weapons, no large-scale battles or harvesters. And the only thing you need Tiberium for here is to grab it, fly into a crowd of enemies, and blow yourself up. This game mode itself is interesting, and there are no complaints about it. But this is clearly not what players expected from C&C. If it had been a separate game mode, there would have been no problems at all.

Design. The graphics have taken a few steps back from the previous game. The units look like Lego toys, the graphics themselves have become brighter and more cartoonish (especially the special effects), and the interface has become the most shabby ever seen in this series. While this design worked with Red Alert, as the game itself is cartoonish and humorous, the Tiberium series has a completely different message. No jokes. Seriously. With Lego toys.

The soundtrack, however, was truly a delight. Many people disliked the ""gypsy howls"" in the background of the Nods, but I thought it was very cool and appropriate, considering that this group was gathered in these very countries.

The end result is a mediocre game, doomed by the acronym C&C. Without this acronym, there would have been many more positive reviews."

But recommend it? EA didn't believe in this game and you can tell. Tiberium 3 and Red Alert 3 had Hollywood names. Full length campaigns. Polished multiplayer to rival StarCraft.

Lo han simplificado al máximo. No puedes construir bases. No hay cosechadoras. 

Como no hay bases, no hay planificación, así que todas las misiones se reducen a dos tipos: escoltar/proteger o  atacar con límite de tiempo.  

Como no hay cosechadoras, no hay gestión de recursos, así que le han puesto límite de unidades (unas 10 a la vez o así), de tal forma que siempre construyes gratis, pero no puedes pasar de tener un reducido número de unidades. El jugador del ordenador durante la campaña por supuesto no tiene límite y puede tener todas las que quiera.

Le han quitado todas las cosas que definían a la saga.Esto es como si al Mario le meten contenido para adultos. A saber en qué estaban pensando los desarrolladores al crear este engendro. Da la impresión de que intentaron copiarse del Company of Heroes y al final ni lo uno ni lo otro. Está tan mal hecho que no harían falta más excusas para despedir a todos los que hayan tomado las decisiones de hacerlo así.

Y para colmo te obliga a estar siempre conectado a internet. Este es otro juego más que pareciera como si lo hubieran querido sabotear desde dentro. El único sentido que tiene jugar a esto es que hayas jugado a todos los anteriores y quieras ver como termina la historia. Ponerlo en nivel fácil y pasarlo cuanto antes.

They've simplified it to the max. You can't build bases. There are no harvesters.

Since there are no bases, there's no planning, so all missions are reduced to two types: escort/protect or attack with a time limit.

Since there are no harvesters, there's no resource management, so they've imposed a unit limit (about 10 at a time or so), so you always build for free, but you can't go beyond a small number of units. The computer player, of course, has no limit during the campaign and can have as many units as they want.

They've stripped out all the things that defined the series. This is like adding adult content to Mario. Who knows what the developers were thinking when they created this monstrosity. It feels like they were trying to copy Company of Heroes, but in the end, they didn't do either. It's so poorly done that no more excuses would be needed to fire everyone who made the decisions to do it this way.

And to top it all off, it forces you to be constantly connected to the internet. This is yet another game that feels like it's been sabotaged from within. The only point in playing this is if you've played all the previous ones and want to see how the story ends. Set it to easy and beat it as soon as possible.

Лично мое мнение:
+
Кампания заделана на ура(можно даже с другом пройти);
Схватка (да это не тибериум, где баталии, а захват и удержание точек, но мне понравилось);
Графика;
Музыка за НОД;
Прокачка и улучшения.
-
Войска(половина не понравились);
Нету моих любимых ""инопланетян"" (т.е. бои только между ГДИ и НОД);
Один командный центр, который теперь с пушками при прокачке(при достижении определенного уровня), однако это для меня не минус, но всё-таки не плюс.

Повторюсь многие также как я не посчитают или просто кампанию обоих фракций не прошли, а сразу пошли в сетевую (всё-таки лучше пройти кампанию(можно и с другом))
Моя рекомендация игры:
8/10","I personally liked the game, but I won't hide the fact that I played it pirated, then bought it to play with friends. I don't understand why there are so many negative reviews.
My personal opinion:
+
The campaign is brilliantly executed (you can even play it with a friend);
Skirmish (yes, it's not Tiberium, where there are battles, but rather capturing and holding points, but I liked it);
Graphics;
Music for Nod;
Leveling up and upgrades.
-
Troops (I didn't like half of them);
There are no my favorite ""aliens"" (i.e., battles are only between GDI and Nod);
One command center, which now has cannons upon leveling up (upon reaching a certain level), which for me is not a minus, but still not a plus.

Again, many people like me won't find it helpful, or they simply haven't played the campaign for both factions and went straight to the multiplayer (it's still better to play the campaign (you can play with a friend))

游戏现状：官网没有鬼服，延迟比较低","Overall Review: A game born at the wrong time.

If this game had waited until 2017 for its release, it probably wouldn't have received the overwhelmingly negative reviews it has today.

If it had been titled ""Red Alert 3 Extra - Tiberium Kings"" instead of ""Command & Conquer 4,"" it might not be in its current predicament.

Here's a resource: This map can help you quickly reach level 20. https://pan.baidu.com/s/1dGHwNbb

First, let's talk about optimization: The game is very well optimized. Even after an hour at highest settings, my computer fan remains very quiet.

I played it on and off for a while, never quite understanding what this game was all about. However, when I occasionally played a game of Honor of Kings, I couldn't help but sigh: This game was truly released too early. People at the time didn't understand the gameplay and simply assumed it was like the old Command & Conquer games: just build a bunch of troops and push forward to win.

Base teleport time = ""Enemy troops have ten seconds to arrive at the battlefield.""
Select MCV type: Attack, Defense, Support = ""Warrior, Mage, Crowd Control.""
Please log in to your EA account = ""Summoner, please log in first.""
Technology unlocked at level 20 = Healing unlocked at level XX, Run unlocked at level XX, Flash unlocked at level 25
Cannot crush = I've never heard of Guan Yu being able to crush
Population limit = I've never heard of King of Glory being able to control multiple heroes
Capture Tiberium Network Center to gain points = Destroy the crystal to win
5v5 = 5v5
Collect Tiberium to gain technology upgrades = Upgrade your jungler's equipment

This game is 60% similar to King of Glory. Why isn't it fun? Because, dear Commander, you're viewing it through the lens of traditional Command & Conquer.
The graphics are the same as Red Alert 3.
This game isn't called Command & Conquer 4, it's called: Red Alert 3 Extra - Tiberium Kings
Reminder: Don't play the story, just play 5v5.
Game status: There are no ghost servers on the official website, and the latency is relatively low."

Die Bilder haben nicht gelogen und es sieht wirklich so aus, jetzt kommt aber der springende Punkt weshalb ich eine Rückerstattung meines Geldes (Bundle mit C&C 3) beantragt habe: Es macht überhaupt keinen Spaß!

Ich versuche das etwas näher zu erläutern. Und zwar gibt es bei dem Spiel nun drei verschiedene MBFs (Offensiv, Defensiv und Unterstützung) die alle unterschiedliche Fähigkeiten, Einheiten und Gebäude haben.
Die ersten paar Minuten waren sehr verwirrend und ich wusste nicht mal wie ich nun ein Gebäude platziere. Nach wenigen Minuten habe ich das nun auch herausgefunden, aber der Spielspaß blieb erheblich auf der Strecke durch das geswitche von offensiven zu defensive zu unterstützendem MBF.

Ich bin echt enttäuscht von dem Spiel und nicht nur wegen dem Spiel selber, sondern man muss sich bei EA (Origin) anmelden um das Spiel zu spielen.","I was looking forward to the game because the pictures made it look different from the typical old C&C games. The pictures didn't lie, and it really does look like that, but now comes the crux of the matter, which is why I requested a refund of my money (bundled with C&C 3): It's not fun at all!

I'll try to explain this in a little more detail. The game now has three different MBFs (Offensive, Defensive, and Support), each with different abilities, units, and buildings.
The first few minutes were very confusing, and I didn't even know how to place a building. After a few minutes, I figured it out, but the fun of the game was significantly diminished by switching from offensive to defensive to support MBF.

I'm really disappointed with the game, and not just because of the game itself, but because you have to sign up with EA (Origin) to play the game."

Не долго думая я решил приобрести все игры C&C 3. Оказалось, что EA выпустило продолжение этой саги - C&C 4: Tiberian Twilight и я решил, что и её тоже необходимо приобрести, но когда перешёл на страницу с отзывами - я начал сомневаться в целесообразности данной покупки, т.к. отзывы были крайне негативные. Почитал их. Ну, думаю, куплю всё-равно, благо если покупать комплектом все игры данной серии, то скидка покрывала большую часть стоимости 4й части. Всё же хотелось верить в то, что фанатам просто не понравилась новая механика, я же не был столь строгим консерватором и решил дать игре шанс. Каково же было моё разочарование когда я начал в неё играть, предварительно пройдя C&C 3... Такой скучной и неинтересной стратегии-кликера мне ещё не попадалось... Даже Кейн не смог хоть сколько-нибудь сгладить негативного впечатления от этой поделки. Сюжет ни о чём, ролики унылые и неинтересные, миссии скучные, а иногда и нудные когда нужно кругами бегать за вражескими краулерами. Проходил на высоком уровне сложности, может быть это добавило дополнительного негатива - не знаю, но в C&C 3 это только усиливало положительные эмоции! Ну да, а тут, выходит, усиливало отрицательные... В общем я не советую фанатам играть в эту игру, уж лучше прочтите на Википедии или ещё где-нибудь сюжет и надейтесь на выход когда-нибудь в светлом будущем адекватной 5й части.

P.S.: чтобы поиграть в игру нужно зарегистрироваться на сайте EA и потом при каждом запуске игры вводить логин и пароль от этой учётки. Столько телодвижений для игры такого уровня?? В общем имейте ввиду.","One day, while shopping, I stumbled upon a great deal on the C&C 3 series, and I was overcome with nostalgia for this masterpiece of gaming. Without much thought, I decided to buy all the C&C 3 games. It turned out that EA had released a sequel to this saga, C&C 4: Tiberian Twilight, and I decided I had to get it too. But when I went to the reviews page, I began to doubt the wisdom of this purchase, as the reviews were extremely negative. I read them. Well, I figured I'd buy it anyway, since if you buy all the games in the series together, the discount covers most of the cost of the fourth game. I still wanted to believe that fans simply didn't like the new mechanics, but I wasn't such a strict conservative and decided to give the game a chance. Imagine my disappointment when I started playing it after finishing C&C 3... I've never encountered such a boring and uninteresting clicker strategy game... Even Kane couldn't even slightly smooth over the negative impression I got from this piece of junk. The plot is worthless, the cutscenes are dull and uninteresting, the missions are boring, and sometimes even tedious when you have to run around in circles chasing enemy crawlers. I played it on the hard difficulty level, and maybe that added to the negative emotions—I don't know, but in C&C 3 it only intensified the positive emotions! Well, yes, but here, it seems, it intensified the negative ones... Overall, I don't recommend this game to fans; it's better to read the plot on Wikipedia or somewhere else and hope for a proper 5th installment to be released someday in the bright future.

P.S.: To play the game, you need to register on the EA website and then enter your username and password for that account every time you launch the game. So much body movement for a game of this level?? Just keep that in mind."

В игру  добавили  автосохранения, которое  лично я ждал все части.  Сюжет конечно так себе,  но он был гoвнoм  и в Tiberium Wars  и в  Ярости  Кейна, так  что за  сюжет даже смысла  критиковать нет. Единственное что непривычно - новая  механика, но она неплохая. Она просто другая. 

Также я  не очень понял как  ГСБ  стало ГДИ и для  чего Кейн тусовался  с  гаишнками. 
[h1] Я поставлю этой игре 8 Кейнов  из 10  на зло хейтерам! [/h1]",">Positive (305)
>Negative (1,303)
What kind of animals left 1,303 negative reviews? The game supports co-op, which is not supported in the other games. They added autosave, which I personally have been waiting for in all the games. The story is so-so, of course, but it was crap in both Tiberium Wars and Kane's Wrath, so there's no point in criticizing it. The only thing that's unusual is the new mechanics, but they're not bad. They're just different.

I also didn't quite understand how GDI became GDI and why Kane was hanging out with the traffic cops.
[h1] I'll give this game 8 Kane out of 10, to spite the haters! [/h1]"

Bei C&C 3 konnte man schon sehen wohin es geht . Rush , nach 15 Minuten hat man entweder gewonnen oder verlohren . Man spielt gezielt auf eine Einheit , und davon möglichst viele hin . Keine Taktik , keine Strategie ist mehr gefragt , sondern nur mehr Geschwindigkeit . Und  zu allem kommt noch die Basis die keine mehr ist . Sie ist beweglich und ist eigendlich eine weiter Einheit im Spiel geworden . Schade !!!
C&C Generals , und noch mehr C&C Generals - Zero Hour sind bei weiten die besten Strategiespiele die EA je gemacht hat .
Leider brigt EA seit jahren nur noch Schrot und schlechte Abcash-Aufgüsse ehemals sehr guter Spiele","Unfortunately, the worst C&C there is.

In C&C 3, you could already see where it was headed. Rush, after 15 minutes you've either won or lost. You play specifically for one unit, and as many of them as possible. No tactics, no strategy is required anymore, just more speed. And on top of all that, there's the base, which isn't a base anymore. It's mobile and has essentially become another unit in the game. What a shame!!!
C&C Generals, and even more C&C Generals - Zero Hour are by far the best strategy games EA has ever made.
Unfortunately, for years now, EA has been producing nothing but junk and poor cash-in rehashes of formerly excellent games."

CNC4就如同HOMM4，如果你能接受英雄无敌4之于英雄无敌3、5的差距，也就可能可以接受CNC4之于CNC2、3甚至RA的差距。
CNC4确实做到了非常高度的平衡性和竞技性，以致于整个游戏几乎变成了dead game，几乎毫无娱乐性可言，但这确实是一个了不起的设想，把即时战略和策略糅合在一起，只不过就如同英雄无敌4一样，游戏在还有润色空间的情况下就发布了........
剧情，甚至都不如西木时代，好吧，其实只是和CNC3的断代过于显著了，Kane的人设变动以及塔西图斯的设定变动，让剧情变得不知所云，加上两大阵营最后几章的过场电影，scrin塔里白白的一片，和那个非常突兀的传送门............想想西木，想想CNC3.......

在我心目中EA确实毁了CNC系列，CNC4也是蛇尾之作，而且也不会再有CNC5，加上非常愚蠢和某碧有得一拼的高级土豆服务器，形同虚设极其愚蠢的指挥官经验值系统（这是个收集养成类卡牌游戏没错），以及愚蠢的让你想要删游戏的敌我AI差距，这确实是一部极其糟糕的CNC。
但是
但是
他给我们打开了一扇通往新的CNC世界的大门，只是，这扇门摇摇欲坠，也并不美观，于是，谁也不想再走过去了。

对，EA甚至都不想高清重置CNC1、2和RA1、2。

最后的最后，极其不推荐单买，哪怕是打折...........因为就算科学上网也解决不了EA账号的问题=- =

但是看到泰坦 看到乳齿象 看到长毛象 看到科迪亚克 看到cyborg 看到火焰坦克 诶 还是算了吧 毕竟以后再也看不到了~","I'm tempted to write a negative review and not recommend it, but I have to give it a neutral rating, so I'll just give it a recommendation.

CNC4 is like HOMM4. If you can accept the difference between Heroes of Might and Magic 4 and Heroes of Might and Magic 3 and 5, you can probably also accept the difference between CNC4 and CNC2, 3, and even Raid.
CNC4 truly achieves a very high level of balance and competitive play, to the point where the entire game is practically dead. The game is practically unentertaining, but it's a brilliant concept, blending real-time strategy and strategy. Just like Heroes of Might and Magic IV, it was released before it even had room for polish...

The plot isn't even as good as the Westwood era. Okay, really, it's just that the gap between it and Clash of Clans 3 is too significant. The changes to Kane's character and Tacitus's setting make the plot incoherent. Add to that the cinematic sequences in the final chapters between the two factions, the blank expanse of the Scrin Tower, and that utterly abrupt portal... Think Westwood, think Clash of Clans 3...

In my opinion, EA has truly ruined the Clash of Clans series. Clash of Clans 4 was a flop, and there won't be a Clash of Clans 5. Add to that the incredibly stupid, high-level potato servers that rival those of a certain Pixar, the ineffective and incredibly stupid Commander XP system (this is a collectible card game, yes), and the ridiculously disparate AI between the enemy and your friends that makes you want to quit the game, and this is truly a truly terrible Clash of Clans. But… but… He opened the door to a new world of CNC, albeit one that was shaky and unsightly, so no one wanted to go through it again.

Yes, EA doesn't even want to remaster CNC1 and 2 and RA1 and 2 in HD.

Finally, I strongly recommend against buying them individually, even on sale… because even a simple internet connection won't solve the EA account issue. =-=

But seeing the Titan, the Mastodon, the Mammoth, the Kodiak, the Cyborg, and the Flame Tank… well, forget it. After all, I'll never see them again."

Из плюсов разве что:

- Оборонительные башенки и некоторые постройки смотрятся достаточно красиво

- Ну и ввиду применения движка с Red Alert 3 масовки стали выглядеть чуть более красочно чем в 3 части

- Заставочки вроде все так же хороши как и в предыдущей игре

- Не плохо сделаны карты в какой-то степени (на мой взгляд), хотя они и создают ощущение ""скованности""
 
  На этом пожалуй плюсы заканчиваются...

Из минусов:

- Отсутствие базы как таковой, приходтся ходить альтернативной версией АТ-АТ и ""рожать"" себе юнитов, которые кстати впервые за все время ограничены...

- Новый движок с Red Alert 3, движок не спорю не плох, НО ОН НЕЛОХ ДЛЯ RED ALERT ИСТОРИИ, А НЕ ДЛЯ ТИБЕРИЯ, ввиду этого после 3 части кажется что зашел в какой-то жалкий плагиат на замечательную серию...

- Возможно я сейчас жутко предираюсь, НО в развед информации в прошлой игре говорилось что ГСБ ПОЧТИ ПОЛНОСТЬЮ ОТКАЗАЛАСЬ ОТ ШАГАЮЩЕЙ ТЕХНИКИ ПОСЛЕ ВТОРОЙ ВОЙНЫ ЗА ТЕБЕРИЙ, не считая джагернаута, а что тут??? ШАГАЮЩАЯ ТЕХНИКА ВЕЗДЕ НАХЕР, как по мне это довольно нелепо...

- Ретекстурирование танка ""Скорпион"".... я когда впервые его увидел меня почти сразу же вывернуло, настолько мне показалось это высером... так же как и ретекстурирование танка ""Призрак""... 

- ХМ...ЧТО ЭТО? СЕРИЯ ИГР ЗАВЯЗАННАЯ НА ДОБЫЧЕ ТИБЕРИЯ?? А ДАВАЙТЕ УБЕРЕМ ВОЗМОЖНОСТЬ ЕГО ДОБЫВАТЬ, ВОТ ВЕСЕЛО БУДЕТ И ОСТАВЛЯТЬ БУДЕМ ПО НЕСКОЛЬКО КУСОЧКОВ НА УРОВЕНЬ, ДА И ПОХЕР ЧТО ОН ПОЧТИ ПОЛНОСТЬЮ ЗАРАЗИЛ И ОТРАВИЛ ЗЕМЛЮ И РАСТЕТ ВЕЗДЕ И ПРОИЗВОДИТ ТОКСИНЫ ОБРАЩАЮЩИЕ ЛЮДЕЙ В МУТАНТОВ...ХМ...МУТАНТЫ?....НЕ, НАХЕР И ИХ ОТСЮДА....ТАК ШО ТУТ ИНТЕРФЕЙС ПРИЯТНЫЙ БЫЛ В ПРЕДЫДУЩЕЙ ЧАСТИ ГОВОРИТЕ, ХОРОШО, МЫ ЕГО ДОПИЛИМ...ТАК ЭТО НАХЕР...ЭТО ТОЖЕ...А?

А по итогу могу сказать - вы можете купить этот шлак по скидочке если вы все таки хотите узнать что там осталось от легендарной серии игр...ИБО ЕА ПРОСТО СДЕЛАЛА ЭТУ ХЕРНЮ СПЛАВИВ ГОВНО С КАРТОНОМ СИДЯ В ТУАЛЕТЕ И ИСПОЛЬЗУЯ КЛОЧОК ТУАЛЕТНОЙ БУМАГИ ДЛЯ НАПИСАНИЯ ПЛАНА РАЗРАБОТКИ....","It's a shame that such a great series ended on such a complete and utter crap...

On the plus side:

- The defensive turrets and some buildings look quite nice.

- And thanks to the use of the engine from Red Alert 3, the crowd scenes now look a little more colorful than in Part 3.

- The cutscenes seem to be just as good as in the previous game.

- The maps are not badly designed, to some extent (in my opinion), although they do create a feeling of ""constraint.""

That's where the pluses end, I think...

On the minuses:

- The lack of a base as such, you have to use an alternative version of the AT-AT and ""give birth"" to your own units, which, by the way, are limited for the first time ever...

- The new engine from Red Alert 3, I admit, is not bad, BUT IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE RED ALERT STORY, NOT FOR TIBERIUS. Because of this, after Part 3, it feels like a pathetic rip-off of a wonderful game. series...

- Maybe I'm being terribly picky right now, BUT the intelligence in the last game said that GDI ALMOST COMPLETELY ABOLISHED WALKING VEHICLES AFTER THE SECOND TIBERIUM WAR, not counting the Juggernaut, so what's going on here??? WALKING VEHICLES EVERYWHERE, that's pretty ridiculous to me...

- The retexturing of the Scorpion tank... when I first saw it, I was almost immediately disgusted, it seemed so bullshit to me... just like the retexturing of the Ghost tank...

- HM... WHAT IS THIS? A GAME SERIES ABOUT TIBERIUM MINING?? LET'S REMOVE THE POSSIBILITY OF MINING IT, IT WILL BE FUN AND WE'LL LEAVE A FEW PIECES PER LEVEL, AND I DON'T CARE THAT IT HAS ALMOST COMPLETELY INFECTED AND POISONED THE EARTH AND IS GROWING EVERYWHERE AND PRODUCING TOXINS THAT TURN PEOPLE INTO MUTANTS... HM... MUTANTS?... NO, FUCK GET THEM OUT OF HERE TOO... SO THE INTERFACE HERE WAS NICE IN THE PREVIOUS PART, SAY, OKAY, WE'LL FINISH IT... SO FUCK THAT... THIS TOO... HUH? WHAT? PLANET? AND FUCK THE PLANET, JUST LEAVE THE BUTTONS ON A BLUE BACKGROUND, THAT'S A FUCKING MASTERPIECE... HUH? WHAT'S THAT? BATTLES, RIGHT? Hmm... COOL... WHY THE FUCK DO WE GET THEM OUT OF HERE...

And in the end, I can say – you can buy this garbage at a discount if you still want to see what's left of the legendary game series... BECAUSE EA JUST MADE THIS SHIT BY MIXING SHIT WITH CARDBOARD WHILE SITTING ON THE TOILET AND USING A SCRAP OF TOILET PAPER TO WRITE A DEVELOPMENT PLAN..."

　　画面表现8.5分：平滑又独具特色的画面融合了大量的华丽特效和酷炫的单位动画。

　　声效表现8.5分：强大的管弦乐队演绎出了高质量的音效。

　　上手体验7.5分：得分系统和可移动的基地是个有趣的变化，但是似乎并不是进步，而是原地打转。

　　耐玩性7.0分：加入5V5在线游戏确实能让你忙活一阵，如果你想解锁GDI和Nod的全部单位的话，那更是有的玩了。

　　总评：7.4分

　　整体评价：

　　看到开发组和发行商冒着危险继续推出已经多少有些过时的游戏题材，这样的感觉还不错。《命令与征服》传统的游戏机制相信大家已经非常熟悉了。如果他们继续，就必须要做出一些改变。EA洛杉矶这次并没有仅仅对画面和其他内容进行精加工，而是彻底重写了游戏的规则，让大家体会到了颠覆性的感觉。《命令与征服4》据称是泰伯利亚题材的最后一部。在游戏中你将体验到节奏飞快的基于不同兵种的实时策略战斗。  基地是可移动的，而Tiberium矿产也消失了，而获得分数是你的主要目标。游戏节奏飞快，十分混乱，因此说在线团队游戏一定非常有趣。可惜，游戏的战役模式设置不合理，想法不错但是又根本没有必要的解锁系统限制了游戏的整体表现。

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

　　众媒体点评：

　　gamingxp：87/100，优异

　　“作为一款历史悠久的知名系列的完结作，《命令与征服4》的表现恰如其分，一个老故事传奇般的结束以及注入大量新鲜的元素……最让我感到印象深刻的是，游戏营造的战场氛围，这方面表现极其成功，这得益于高质量的视频效果以及一个令人深思的故事安排，这让玩家有很强的代入感，并且能立刻沉浸在战场上。玩家可以看到破败或壮观的城市，包含大量细节的，代表市民文化的东西，比如广告牌，电线杆或者汽车，当然，这些事物对游戏本身并没有直接的影响，但长久以来，正是这种良好的氛围才塑造了命令与征服今日的地位。”


　　gamepro：80/100，不错

　　“排除了恼人的DRM签名管理问题，命令与征服4的游戏体验无疑是令人愉快的，当然，铁杆玩家或许不能接受爬行者以及不能采矿的改变，但是想法开放的玩家应该给游戏一个机会，开发者试图为游戏开辟一个崭新的发展方向，而这一劳动成果显然值得我们去体验！”

　　“总的来说，爬行者系统运转良好，多人游戏表现稳定，持续性的升级和解锁设置，很容易让玩家沉迷于此，此外，游戏的故事，显然可以让老玩家感到满意……当然，游戏的缺点也清晰可见，需要时刻接入互联网，并且一些地图上，会出现一些导致不平衡现象的发生。”


　　pcgamer：73/100

　　“公平的说，如果这款游戏的名字中没有包含“4”，那一定会是一个皆大欢喜的结果，因为玩家总是对所谓的终结之作抱有极高的期待，而这款游戏的表现显然达不到这种程度。我们认为游戏中的很多探索，设计初衷应该是一款网络游戏……不过考虑到这款游戏即便是单人任务，都需要接入EA的服务器，我们希望玩家谨慎对待，不要忘记发售还不到两年的雇佣兵2，刚刚被EA停服，我们不能够买一款心仪的产品，还要担心网络服务是否能持续很久。没错，游戏的多人部分非常出彩，但是我们头顶上悬着的达摩克利斯之剑也令人担忧！”","Overall Rating: 6.5: Well-made real-time cutscenes, simple chat system. The plot feels a bit rushed, and the campaign mode is disappointing. The unlock system limits the game's performance in some areas.

Graphics: 8.5: Smooth and distinctive graphics are complemented by a wealth of gorgeous special effects and cool unit animations.

Sound: 8.5: The powerful orchestra delivers high-quality sound effects.

Playability: 7.5: The scoring system and movable bases are interesting changes, but they feel more like going in circles than progress.

Playability: 7.0: The addition of 5v5 online play does keep you busy for a while, and unlocking all the units of GDI and Nod is even more rewarding.

Overall Rating: 7.4

Overall Review:

It's nice to see the developer and publisher taking the risk of continuing to release a game genre that's become somewhat outdated. The traditional Command & Conquer gameplay is familiar to everyone. If they continue, they'll have to make some changes. EA Los Angeles didn't just polish the graphics and other elements this time; they completely rewrote the rules of the game, delivering a truly groundbreaking experience. Command & Conquer 4 is purportedly the final installment in the Tiberium series. It features fast-paced, real-time strategy combat with different classes. Bases are mobile, Tiberium deposits are gone, and scoring is your primary goal. The game's fast-paced and chaotic pace promises to be incredibly engaging in online team play. Unfortunately, the campaign mode is poorly designed, with a well-thought-out but unnecessary unlock system that limits the overall performance.

Media Reviews:

GamingXP: 87/100, Excellent

""As the finale of a long-standing and renowned series, Command & Conquer 4 delivers a fittingly stellar performance, delivering a legendary conclusion to an old story while injecting a wealth of fresh elements... What impressed me most was the game's ability to create a truly atmospheric battlefield. This aspect is incredibly successful, thanks to high-quality visuals and a thoughtful storyline, which creates a strong sense of immersion and allows players to instantly immerse themselves in the battlefield. Players can see cities, both dilapidated and magnificent, with richly detailed representations of civic culture, like billboards, telephone poles, and cars. While these elements don't directly impact the game itself, it's this atmosphere that has long shaped Command & Conquer's standing.""

GamePro: 80/100, Good

""Aside from the annoying DRM signature management issues, Command & Conquer 4 is an undeniably enjoyable gaming experience. Of course, hardcore gamers might not be thrilled with the changes to creepers and the inability to mine. But open-minded players should give the game a chance. The developers are trying to forge a new direction for the game, and the fruits of their labor are clearly worth experiencing!""

""Overall, the crawler system works well, the multiplayer performance is stable, and the continuous upgrades and unlocks make it easy to get addicted. Moreover, the game's story will clearly satisfy veteran players... Of course, the game's shortcomings are also obvious. It requires a constant internet connection, and some maps have some unbalanced effects.""

pcgamer: 73/100

""To be fair, if this game didn't have the """" in its name, it would be... Including ""4"" would have been a happy ending, as players always have extremely high expectations for so-called final games, and this game clearly doesn't live up to that standard. We believe that many of the explorations in the game were originally designed as an online game... However, considering that even single-player missions require access to EA's servers, we urge players to proceed with caution. Remember, Mercenaries 2, which was released less than two years ago and was recently shut down by EA, can't just buy a product we love and worry about the long-term sustainability of the network service. Yes, the multiplayer aspects of the game are excellent, but the Sword of Damocles hanging over our heads is also worrying!"

Edit- 
imacatusee most reviews are personal opinion. And you are correct I did not go into any detail with mechanics etc. But I played this game a long time ago. Like 6+ years ago. I was maybe 24 years old at most. I did not play the game long. After I found out how bad it was I stopped playing right away. I then went and read various reviews like I should have before buying the game! I learnt that I was right to stop playing as the game only gets worse not better! So in a nut shell I don't even remember all the issues with the game. Some float around in the back of my head but it's just that bad.... If I went to brainstorm a proper review I would end up hating myself for putting more effort into the review then the developers put into the product. 

So my review still stands as a warning! Basically people can see my review. Go oh... he did not like this game. Maybe I should read more reviews or check out a lets play or video etc... But this game is god awful. Like a 0 out of 10. Okay fine it's more like a 2 out of 10.  Noo.... Actually it may be like a 0 out of 10. If you can't PAY me to play it then we have issues.","Wow....

A C&C 4 nem olyan játék, mint amit megszokhattak a játékosok az előző részeknél. Itt nincs begyűjtés, jelentősebb építkezés sem, csupán elfoglalható létesítméynek. Mindennek ellenére nem lenne olyan rossz a játék, ha a küldetéseket lehetne egyjátékos módban játszani. Sajnos mint utóbb kiderült, a negyedik küldetés lehetetlen egyjátékos módban, mivel akkora az ellenség túlereje, hogy egyedül induló játékost lenyomja a gép mint a csikket. ""Solo"" lehetőség félrevezetés! Limit van minden játékosnál, ami 50-es. Akkor lenne esély a győzelemre, ha ez nem lenne. Limittel pedig képtelenség elég egységet vezényelni az óriás hajó elpusztítására. (NOD)
GDI kampányt ki sem próbáltam, gyanítom ott is csak az első 2-3 küldetés játszható egyjátékosban, azután a túlerő megekasztja a sztorit. nagyon valószínű, hogy a kampány előrehaladtával a párban induló játékosok összhadereje is kevés lenne, mivel alapból három féle bázis választható ki: Védekezés, támadás, támogatás. Egyik sem alkalmas a küldetések megoldására emberhiányban. Öszintén szólva biztos voltam benne, hogy mivel solo kületés módban vagyok, leskálázódik az ellenséges haderő, de nem. Nem segít az alacsonyabb nehézségi szint választása sem. El kell fogadni, hogy ez egy kizárólag többjátékos kaland.

A zene fasza mint mindíg, de ez nem nyújt vígaszt.
Kár érte, talán ha lesz valamikor C&C 5, az majd nem lesz ekkora baklövés.",

There are three major reasons why this game is an awful buy, I believe it was a waste of money due to how horrible the three things are.
1) the RTS from the original games allowed for full unit usage. What I mean is you where not limited to what you could play with depending on the structure you choose durring a deploy phase. Yep you are limited in your units as to which of three main stuctures you choose. While this was a great idea you can only deploy one crawler at a time where enmies in the main story can deploy more. This makes the game play fustratingly difficult.
2) The severly limited pop cap, Ok population caps are important but in the game the pop cap is 50.... units beyond basic crap units are 6 or higher. This is awlful considering how limited and how long it takes to produce said units. In pvp this can be a fustrating experance. In story mode it is even more so due to the fact each crawler of an opponate has its own cap of 50.
3) You do not build.... Ok bar the previous two issues this is my main problem with this game command and conquer is a paced building war machine... this means you start a map with little and you slowly conquer it with a play style that suits your personal abilities. In this game pushing with a large force not happening you cant build multiple development buldings. Want to tower it up? fuck no if your not in the defence crawler, oh and btw these towers blow ass. No i mean seriously they take shit loads of damage from units and do little to no damage to units that they dont directly counter.
Please if you plan to buy this... crap that came out of some programers ass reconsider you will most likely end up regreting the purchuse as i have.","So Id like to go on a extreamly long rant on how they ruined this great series but ill just give you the simple facts.

It's better to quit at the peak of popularity. But not only did they quit, but they also trampled the entire line with the latest installment.
Terrible. EA, as usual, managed to ruin everything by changing the entire game mechanics, because for me, the mechanics of the Command & Conquer series were the best of all strategy games since Generals!

Pros:
-Kane
-New Tactics
-Kane
-Forgiving game with mistakes
-Uninstallation button
-Did I mention Kane?

Truth be told, there isn't a lot of good things about this game! I played it for as long as I could before I just told myself no! I can't play this anymore! My goal was to play it to see what happened at the end of the game, and for $5, it seems reasonable to waste your money on something so cheap. However, even going into this game KNOWING it's trash, I still couldn't finish it! It was that bad! If you're curious about the ending, just look up the campaign cutscenes through YouTube or something. Do yourself a favor and keep that $5. 

But for the few positive things I did say about it, it is true that Kane (Joseph Kucan) is the only set in stone thing that's worth the buy here. The man's entire life is based on this gaming franchise, and every CaC fan should pay respect to this man's future in this game considering it went downhill for CaC after this game's release. The game also offers new tactics with the Crawler unit that you have to protect now. 

So instead of base building (you know, the thing that made the Command and Conquer gaming franchise famous), you now have this Crawler, and the missions are now turned to escort missions rather than destroying your enemy base! But nevertheless, if you lose a Crawler in battle, do not fret! You get to respawn a new Crawler in a designated area that the AI doesn't know about and you don't have to start over the mission! Yay! All the Crawler does is turn itself into a construction yard and build units to defend it, that's all! No buildings, no Tiberium, no fun! All the player could do with the Crawler is choose between 3 classes, Offence, Defense, and Support. And even though the tutorial gives you all the classes special abilities and whatnot, you have to earn experience points to unlock the simplest abilities! So you're forced to go back and play the same damn missions again and again! 

Ugh! If you look up the interview the developers had once the CaC4 was released, they talked about how RTS games are getting tedious, and how they thought this new change would help it. The problem there is that you don't simply change the entire gameplay that the franchise was founded on. Other games like the Red Alert trilogy, CaC3, CaC General Zero Hour, CaC Tiberium Sun and many others continued to show off the wonderful RTS experience that CaC4 completely killed! You can't do that under the CaC name, you just can't. EA forever killed this franchise, so have fun with their last game if you're still very interested in it. But for the market value of $20, don't even think of purchasing it! It's not worth it! 

If you want to know the negatives, here you go:
Cons:
-Tedious gameplay
-Boring campaign
-Multiplayer servers are down
-Useless units
-No Tiberium collection
-Always have to sign into EA when you start up the game
-No base building

  CNC4的名字取得好，泰伯利亚的黄昏，也是这个系列的黄昏。
  我并不是一个铁杆的CNC粉，我最早接触的RTS是星际，所以反而CNC4的有上限游戏模式是我比较能接受的。但是不得不说CNC4的缺陷太大了，红警3是复制西木的产物，而泰伯利亚的黄昏则是不想复制西木的产物，比起以前的CNC系列甚至是RTS，CNC4几乎成了四不像，甚至连采集资源都没有。对一个长期扎根于帝国时代和星际里面的玩家来说，这是无法接受的地方，一切就只凸显在队伍安排与微操（换弹夹）上面，游戏性非常差。剧情也有很大的缺陷，接不上三代的剧情。所以说，CNC4只是西木过后EA洛杉矶对RTS一次笨拙的尝试。
  我希望EA吸取教训，在CNC5里面（希望会出）走上一条大部分玩家都喜欢的道路，勉勉强强给个好评","I absolutely love RTS games, including Clash of Clans 4, though it left me deeply disappointed.

Clash of Clans 4's name is well-placed: Tiberian Twilight, the twilight of the series itself.

I'm not a die-hard Clash of Clans fan. My first RTS was StarCraft, so Clash of Clans 4's capped game mode is more palatable to me. However, I have to admit that Clash of Clans 4 is deeply flawed. Red Alert 3 was a Westwood clone, while Tiberian Twilight was an attempt to avoid copying Westwood. Compared to previous Clash of Clans series, and even RTS games, Clash of Clans 4 is a complete mess. It doesn't even offer resource gathering. For a longtime player steeped in Age of Empires and StarCraft, this is unacceptable. Everything revolves around team composition and micromanagement (reloading magazines), resulting in a very poor gameplay experience. The storyline is also deeply flawed, failing to connect with the narrative of the three previous games. So, Clash of Clans 4 is just a clumsy attempt by EA Los Angeles at an RTS after Westwood.

I hope EA learns from this and takes a path that most players will enjoy with Clash of Clans 5 (which I hope will come out). I can barely give it a positive review."

I've played a lot of strategy games, so I wasn't too upset by the changes (I adapted quickly) to the gameplay in C&C4.

Its painful to even be on this storepage writing this review. I can honestly feel a tiny twinge of a headache coming on so i'll get to my points.

Command & Conquer, as a series, is one of the grandfathers of all modern base-building RTS games up there with Warcraft as well. While the series saw a few minor adjustments to the lore here 'n there it was always a very solid setting whose factions i'll cover briefly:

The Brotherhood of Nod is/was a paramilitary organization with ties to just about every major country that isn't afflicted w/ Tiberium or the first world ""Blue zones"". It's ranks are comprised not JUST of hundreds of millions of loyal militia but also extremely well-trained and well organized black ops infiltrators and die-hard fantical soldiers. Lead by ""Kane"", while it was never openly announced, it was highly alluded to that he was in fact the mythical brother of Abel from the bible, thus meaning he has existed since almost the literal dawn of time. While Kane was always viewed as EXTREMELY charismatic, he was also astoundingly cunning and a survivor above all, surviving not one but 2 seperate attacks from WMD-scale orbital weapons platforms despite being at the ground-zero of both attacks.

In C&C 4 this appears to have all been retconned and it now alludes that Kane is an alien seeking to go home.

The Global Defense Initiative (or GDI) is effectively the UN/NATO and every other western first-world 3 or 4 letter organization all smashed into one giant organization. GDI are essentially ""The good guys"", the Free world all gathered together to try and stomp out The Brotherhood of Nod and stop Tiberium from spreading across the globe, the highly toxic green crystal has turned much of the planet into an uninhabitable hellscape labled ""Red Zones"" and semi-infested zones (Yellow zones) both of which Nod operates out of predominantly.

Now, as mentioned previously, base-building was extremely important in previous games because your resources were rarely directly inside your base and could deplete rapidly, creating a NEED to control the map's terrain to move to new fields while the expended ones slooooowly regenerated. There was also the matter that air units had to return to the structure that created them to resupply, even the very use of your minimap was a feature given by one of your buildings.

Here, thats no longer the case, base building has been entirely removed and replaced with different 'styles' of command structure, restricting access to what units you can produce. It takes away a huge aspect of the game for the sake of trying to make the game more 'user friendly' but instead only takes away from the experience.

On top of this, C&C 4 was the ending to the story of Kane as far as we were told, it is the conclusion......and it's endings answers precisely zero plot questions despite more and more cropping up as the series progressed. Theres also the matter that the game tries to shoe-horn in a Co-Op experience, something none of the previous games did and while good on paper, it fails to make up for the rest of the game's failures.

In short, C&C 4 neutered a major part of what made the earlier games unique, failed to deliver any note-worthy answers to questions that'd existed since the series began over a decade ago and left most (if not all) of it's fans (as is probably apparent by the reviews) with a very very sour taste in our mouths.","Foreward: Time listed played for this title does not reflect full play-time w/ game, have completed both campaigns.

Its painful to even be on this storepage writing this review. I can honestly feel a tiny twinge of a headache coming on so i'll get to my points.

Command & Conquer, as a series, is one of the grandfathers of all modern base-building RTS games up there with Warcraft as well. While the series saw a few minor adjustments to the lore here 'n there it was always a very solid setting whose factions i'll cover briefly:

The Brotherhood of Nod is/was a paramilitary organization with ties to just about every major country that isn't afflicted w/ Tiberium or the first world ""Blue zones"". It's ranks are comprised not JUST of hundreds of millions of loyal militia but also extremely well-trained and well organized black ops infiltrators and die-hard fantical soldiers. Lead by ""Kane"", while it was never openly announced, it was highly alluded to that he was in fact the mythical brother of Abel from the bible, thus meaning he has existed since almost the literal dawn of time. While Kane was always viewed as EXTREMELY charismatic, he was also astoundingly cunning and a survivor above all, surviving not one but 2 seperate attacks from WMD-scale orbital weapons platforms despite being at the ground-zero of both attacks.

In C&C 4 this appears to have all been retconned and it now alludes that Kane is an alien seeking to go home.

The Global Defense Initiative (or GDI) is effectively the UN/NATO and every other western first-world 3 or 4 letter organization all smashed into one giant organization. GDI are essentially ""The good guys"", the Free world all gathered together to try and stomp out The Brotherhood of Nod and stop Tiberium from spreading across the globe, the highly toxic green crystal has turned much of the planet into an uninhabitable hellscape labled ""Red Zones"" and semi-infested zones (Yellow zones) both of which Nod operates out of predominantly.

Now, as mentioned previously, base-building was extremely important in previous games because your resources were rarely directly inside your base and could deplete rapidly, creating a NEED to control the map's terrain to move to new fields while the expended ones slooooowly regenerated. There was also the matter that air units had to return to the structure that created them to resupply, even the very use of your minimap was a feature given by one of your buildings.

Here, thats no longer the case, base building has been entirely removed and replaced with different 'styles' of command structure, restricting access to what units you can produce. It takes away a huge aspect of the game for the sake of trying to make the game more 'user friendly' but instead only takes away from the experience.

On top of this, C&C 4 was the ending to the story of Kane as far as we were told, it is the conclusion......and it's endings answers precisely zero plot questions despite more and more cropping up as the series progressed. Theres also the matter that the game tries to shoe-horn in a Co-Op experience, something none of the previous games did and while good on paper, it fails to make up for the rest of the game's failures.

The biggest issue is EA's attempt to ""introduce a multitude of innovations to the classic fast and fluid Command & Conquer gameplay"". BIG MISTAKE! A bit of fine tuning or maybe a single change would have been fine and accepted by the masses but attempting to turn the entire RTS genre on it's head from it's root origins way back in Dune 2: Battle for Arrakis/Building a Dynasty (yep I owned both and argued with friends about the title) was a bad idea that wasn't play tested enough and then when executed signaled the death bell of this otherwise Glorious Franchaise.

Audio/Sound: 10/10. The sound engineering and audio in the game is freaking brilliant. The music is absoluting amazing and soulful with each battle/mission. The menu music almost makes you feel like you're in some form of command centre and the troops are awaiting your orders to throw themselves into the fray. It's very thematic and is done well, even the FMV have an excellent tone to them.

Video: 8/10. The visuals are fantastic. The FMV have always been top notch (ignoring Tiberium Dawn's blue-screen era) and they don't disappoint. But while in game I can't help but feel the visuals got a severe downgrade from the E3 trailers and previews. Not sure if it was a QA or coding issue that changed this but it was a bit of a disappointment. But still the game looks great compred to some of the RTS clones out there.

Gameplay: 4/10. Sadly this is where it all goes to hell. It is C&C. But it's not the RTS we want. Or the one we deserve. Mobile fluid command structures aren't anything new. Dark Reign, Supreme Commander and a few others have done this before and always to a varying degree of failure when it comes to reception of the players. Why they decided to follow this course is a mystery... maybe they did want the franchaise to end and die? Why? No idea.

To non-C&C fans of RTS games I must suggest that you avoid this. To the C&C fans whom want to see an ending... well I'm a hardcore fan and played them all back to back(even Renegade) before getting to this game and for me it was worth it to get an ending. If you're not that keen but want to see an ending then I suggest youtube'ing the FMV cinematics but you probably won't get the same impact.

I will say this having an end boss fight was unexpected and a nice twist and the GDI bring the pain with their ultimate super-heavy vehicle (no spoilers I promise) but holy heck it kicks butt and took me 26 minutes to bring down... yep it's that tough but then again I like to play on stupidly hard cause I'm a sucker for pain... hrm maybe that's why I liked the game.

A Mini 'Rebview'!!

Do you like real-time strategy games?
Did you while away hours, just playing skirmish maps  throughout the C&C franchise ?
Did you marvel at the hammy acting and silly stories in the campaign and test friendships in vs battles?
Did you enjoy managing your base and slowly wresting control of the map from your opponents, all the while protecting your harvesters and amassing your forces for that planned overwhelming assault? 
Is Command and Conquer 4 the game for you?
Nope, probably not. 

Thanks for reading, check my other reviews.

What!!?

What do you mean that's not good enough? 

Okay then, second time's a charm....
Do you hate previous Command and Conquer games and wish they never existed? 
Did you play level 7 of Dune 2 as a child and decide if you can't have a base nobody should?
Do you think innovation within a franchise should automatically mean a complete and utter deviation from that franchise's core mechanics? 
Do you get a sense of inner fulfillment when EA takes over other studios and then homogenizes and dumbs their properties down?
Then this might be the game for you..... 
You monster. 

Firstly, sorry to the live action actors, they acted their little hearts out.
And now the dirty work.... 
The game itself 'features' a perspective limited to about 3ft off the ground.
Replacing bases and harvesters is a crawler mechanic done better elsewhere.
The crawler acts as a mobile HQ that can deploy sort of acting like a base, but not.
Limited unit selection is improved slightly as each of the 3 crawlers for the two factions has a selection of unique abilities and units - providing a thin façade of choice - so long as your choice doesn't involve wanting to play a Command and Conquer game!

The game does look good for its age and still had a bunch of people playing it online, but based on my time with the game I'm forced to assume they get some sort of masochistic thrill from sticking with it, but far be it from me to kink shame.

The units may look acceptable but the tiny unit cap in the missions I played was not, the game may have merits when considered as its own thing, but as a long time fan of the franchise and Westwood's work it pains me to see the Command and Conquer title connected to this game.

C&C 4 is a compelling Asylum B movie, tethered to a game forged by an exact and precise series of awful decision; like an entire solar system whose planets orbit comes into alignment once every billion years and unleashes some dark force, Command and Conquer 4 came into being- spawned from a heady mix of EA's contempt for the franchise and a desire for accessibility that seemingly took precedence at every stage of designing the games mechanics.  

If you are new to the franchise or enjoyed Homeworld Deserts of Karak it might be worth playing but as a Command and Conquer fan I'd be honoured to recomend that nobody play this game, ever, not even for nostalgia.... 

Thanks for the read and if you enjoyed this feedback is always appreciated.

Did you play level 7 of Dune 2 as a child and decide if you can't have a base nobody should?
Do you think innovation within a franchise should automatically mean a complete and utter deviation from that franchise's core mechanics? 
Do you get a sense of inner fulfillment when EA takes over other studios and then homogenizes and dumbs their properties down?
Then this might be the game for you..... 
You monster. 

Firstly, sorry to the live action actors, they acted their little hearts out.
And now the dirty work.... 
The game itself 'features' a perspective limited to about 3ft off the ground.
Replacing bases and harvesters is a crawler mechanic done better elsewhere.
The crawler acts as a mobile HQ that can deploy sort of acting like a base, but not.
Limited unit selection is improved slightly as each of the 3 crawlers for the two factions has a selection of unique abilities and units - providing a thin façade of choice - so long as your choice doesn't involve wanting to play a Command and Conquer game!

The game does look good for its age and still had a bunch of people playing it online, but based on my time with the game I'm forced to assume they get some sort of masochistic thrill from sticking with it, but far be it from me to kink shame.

The units may look acceptable but the tiny unit cap in the missions I played was not, the game may have merits when considered as its own thing, but as a long time fan of the franchise and Westwood's work it pains me to see the Command and Conquer title connected to this game.

C&C 4 is a compelling Asylum B movie, tethered to a game forged by an exact and precise series of awful decision; like an entire solar system whose planets orbit comes into alignment once every billion years and unleashes some dark force, Command and Conquer 4 came into being- spawned from a heady mix of EA's contempt for the franchise and a desire for accessibility that seemingly took precedence at every stage of designing the games mechanics.  

If you are new to the franchise or enjoyed Homeworld Deserts of Karak it might be worth playing but as a Command and Conquer fan I'd be honoured to recomend that nobody play this game, ever, not even for nostalgia.... 

Thanks for the read and if you enjoyed this feedback is always appreciated.

With this game, Command and Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight, electronic arts put forth their single greatest INSULT to the gaming community, and ultimately one of the dumbest business decisions in gaming history. In a pathetic, short sighted attempt at trying to push the highly coveted Command And Conquer brand onto a new generation of gamer, they have destroyed everything CNC has stood for.

In order to appeal to a NEW playerbase of (GUESSTIMATE) 50 000-80 000 players from a NEW generation of gamers, they have created a fast paced RTS that is so heavily disconnected from the ENTIRE CNC genre up to this point, it is unrecognizeable as an actual command and conquer title, and more closely resembles a next-gen mobile-tower defense game.

In doing so, EA Games made its BIGGEST mistake. In order to appeal to a NEW small audience, they ALIENATED the older audience which comprises over two MILLION players, probably more. From both a lore standpoint and shockingly a business standpoint, CNC4 was a BIG mistake.

While CNC 4 is in itself a good game for what it is, not a true RTS but more an RTS based mobile tower defense game. Good graphics, good gameplay, good story, brilliant unit balancing, as always to be expected from a CNC title. But, the game is NOT command and conquer. The original CNC games were base building, calling on MASSIVE armies of PC shattering numbers of units into HUGE, tiny or small battlefields.

THAT is what the players of the CNC series grew up with. Thats what they fell in love with. THAT gameplay mechanic of building a fortress and a massve army was what drove CNC fans down its very long history to make it one of if not THE greatest RTS-defining franchises in gaming history.

Command and Conquer universe - with the exception of CNC Renegade (an FPS based in the tiberium universe) - has been defined by base building, resource management, resource collection, base defense, tactical decisions and heavy strategy that have molded playstyles that have blown away other RTS games, and even set the precedent on what to beat for the entire RTS gaming industry.

Command and Conquer Generals and its extension Zero Hour, STILL have a loyal fan base, online community and very extensive modding community that, years on, is still loyally playing a game they've had for ages, completely ignoring anything NEW you try to produce.

But these do not excuse it. It is NOT command and conquer, and for this reason

I DO NOT CONSIDER THIS GAME, CNC4 TIBERIAN TWILIGHT, TO BE CANON TO THE CNC FRANCHISE.

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME."

Some of the plot is coherent, but the later parts feel abruptly concluded. I think the units are somewhat recreated from previous games, which is good. Overall, the game isn't worth the price."

30307058,english,2017.02.04 08:12,❌,✅,0.5,1,"Greetings!  I’m going to say something that doesn’t seem the norm based off the reviews of this game.  I liked this game.  I’ve always been a fan of Command & Conquer and although this game definitely isn’t my favorite it does seem to hold up pretty well.

Graphics:  No, these graphics aren’t amazing but they do hold up from when the game first came out.  I can’t really complain as they were pretty amazing when the game first came out, they hold up pretty well.  Battle damage is still present and the particle effects are still pretty good. I’d love to see more RTS do battle damage and such.

Mechanics:  I have to compare this to a modern product and with that said the mechanics do hold up tolerably but I keep going back to the gold standard of controls for RTS:  StarCraft 2.  I wish RTS would just look at the standard SC2 has set and make that their minimum.  Yes, you need innovation but you should start at least with the core.  I did find the unit selection double press feature very useful (on press you select all combat units, double and you select all units).  If I was rating this completely on mechanics I’d probably be more in the not recommend as the controls have not kept up in the world of precision, to many times I couldn’t move a unit too close to something or his pathing would lead him somewhere completely opposite of where I wanted him to go.  And…one game type for skirmish?  Really? Sigh.

RPG:  I wish more games would include some of the leveling features that this game has, I’d love to see a mode where you level up and unlock new units, or include veterancy.  Yes, I know these aren’t very ‘competitive’ features, so maybe make them toggled or their own game type.  In fact, the core design of this game (the mobile base building and focus on less units and more action) would be an amazing game type for RTS but kind of falls flat as the core component.  Ultimately, I would have loved to see this game take off more so if nothing else these game types would have continued on.

Story:  Unfortunately, this story felt the most forgettable over all the other C&C games.  I know I beat this when it first came out but for the life of me didn’t remember any of the story, I actually remember the story of most of the C&C world but this one slipped me.  I’m not sure if they weren’t trying but it actually felt more like a game copying the C&C world than a C&C game.

Ultimately, I am cycling between a positive or negative review.  I look at everything and see more negative thoughts than positive, but this game is 6 years old and I just replayed the campaign and overall enjoyed it… but I love C&C.  Should you buy this?  Eh, if you like C&C yes, if you are just looking for a good RTS I’d look elsewhere or go back in time 6 years and play it when it comes out.","Greetings!

This version greatly rewarded those who knows a little bit of micro-managing (Especially those who are good in that matter). New gameplay, new strategies, new tactics.

打过RA3的童鞋们应该看得出来，这代和RA3用的应该是一个引擎……
然而却远不如RA3好玩儿……（也许是我不太会微操把……）
为什么把RTS传统的造兵模式取消了……只留下一个令人蛋疼的主基地，和人口限制……
我很想说：“我需要更多的补给站……“
“不好意思我们没有补给站可以给你用……”
“我需要泰伯伦矿，或是晶体矿，哪怕是横在城市道路中央的矿井都可以！”
“不好意思，泰伯伦控制网络不让您采矿了，那些残余的晶体是您升级用的“
画面过得去，剧情没看完……
你问我为什么没看完？操作太蛋疼，单位经常犯傻站一边儿啥事儿不干还挡路。搞死别人的基地都要搞半天，断别人经济这一招也用不上了，多矿点工作用经济和兵力碾压对手也用不上了，这不是我要的RTS！
想玩SC2，CNC3甚至是RA3的那种即时战略的孩子们别想了，这不是你想要的东西！



","Anyone who's played RA3 should be able to tell that this game uses the same engine...

However, it's nowhere near as fun as RA3... (Maybe I'm just not very good at micromanaging...)

Why did they remove the traditional RTS unit-building system... leaving only a frustrating main base and population limits...

I really want to say, ""I need more supply stations...""

""Sorry, we don't have any supply stations for you...""

""I need Tiberium or crystals, even if they're just mines in the middle of a city road!""

""Sorry, the Tiberium control network won't let you mine. Those remaining crystals are for your upgrades.""

The graphics are okay, but I haven't finished the story...

Why haven't I finished it? The controls are terrible. Units often just stand around doing nothing and blocking the way. It takes ages to destroy the enemy's base. Cutting off their economy is useless, and using more mines to crush the enemy with both economy and troops is useless. This isn't my RTS!

For those of you who want to play real-time strategy games like SC2, CNC3, or even RA3, forget it! This isn't what you want!

Да, всё в новинку, да всё красочно, НО:
1. Появилась такая ненужная и непонятная вещь, как Уровень, а это значит, что все юниты и постройки недоступны пока не достигнешь этого уровня (ЗАЧЕМ?!).
2. По сравнению с Red alert 3 интерфэйс сделали как бы удобнее (но нет), убрали возможность вынужденной атаки (она в принципе и не нужна была, но жалко), и опять-таки УРОВНИ не дают насладиться игрой.
3. По-видимому игру старались заточить под мультиплеер (И да, в ней есть люди, около 30 человек точно играют).
4. Кампания как-бы есть, но её как таковой НЕТ. Где красивые заставки как в Red Alert 3?!
В общем, я думал если меня КэК Red Alert 3 удивил, то эта игра тем более, как я ошибался... Хотя 224Р на неё не особо жалко... Игра сделала не революционный шаг вперёд, а скорей, споткнулась и откатилась на пару метров назад(Нет, я не наркоман). Она стала каким-то Star Craft-ом 2...
Крч 6/10.","Well, the game is certainly not bad, but I expected more...
Yes, everything is new, and everything is colorful, BUT:
1. There's this unnecessary and confusing feature called ""Level,"" which means all units and buildings are unavailable until you reach that level (WHY?!).
2. Compared to Red Alert 3, the interface has been made more user-friendly (but it hasn't), the forced attack feature has been removed (it wasn't really needed, but it's a shame), and again, the LEVELS make the game difficult to enjoy.
3. Apparently, they tried to optimize the game for multiplayer (And yes, there are people playing, definitely around 30).
4. There's a campaign, but it's NOT a campaign. Where are the beautiful intros like in Red Alert 3?!
So, I thought if Red Alert 3 surprised me, this game would be even more so. How wrong I was... Although I don't really mind spending 224P on it... The game didn't take a revolutionary step forward, but rather stumbled and rolled back a few meters (no, I'm not a drug addict). It became some kind of StarCraft 2...

Je préfère même rejouer aux premiers de la série tant celui-ci propose un gameplay totalement aux antipodes des C&C comme on les aime ! 

Niveau graphisme ce jeu est limite, niveau gameplay c'est du cap & win en spammant les unités comme un abruti, pas de constructions possibles de batiments, progression de niveau global qui permet de créer seulement 1/3 des unités au début du jeu, se débloque par faction (donc nécessite la même stupide jauge à remplir pour les deux factions), seulement 2 factions jouables, le mode en ligne est impossible sans avoir tout débloqué car les autres joueurs vous feront les fesses...

Ce jeu est à éviter, je l'ai acheté dans le bundle en promo de C&C et très honnêtement je regrette sincèrement de l'avoir eu dedans, j'aurais préféré ne pas l'obtenir et passer à coté de cet étron tellement la désillusion est grande...

Global level progression only allows you to create 1/3 of the units at the start of the game. It's unlocked by faction (so you need the same stupid gauge to fill for both factions). There are only two playable factions. Online mode is impossible without unlocking everything because other players will give you a hard time...

This game is to be avoided. I bought it in the C&C discount bundle, and quite honestly, I sincerely regret having included it. I would have preferred not to get it and pass up this turd, the disappointment is so great...

Even on sale, this game isn't worth buying. The appeal of such a game is strictly reserved for people who like this kind of game, certainly not for those who like C&C... This is a completely different game, I repeat..."

18年的CNC也是结束了，从小玩红警长大，对这个系列感情很深，将军2胎死腹中之后，CNC4注定是系列的终点了，还真的没想到最终作是这么个奇行种……（虽然我断断续续好几年才把战役通了）

首先来说这个游戏的成品质量：
　　剧情基本烂片，制作完全没有3代的水准；地图非常糊弄，程序相当偷懒（地形与单位碰撞检测无语得想砸键盘，各种单位空气墙），大家都能看出来这款“正统续作”根本就不算是亲生的，不论哪一方面都在透露着低成本赶工骗情怀的嘴脸。

再来具体谈谈这游戏的玩法设计：
　　本作对系列前作来说都是颠覆性的变革——简化建造部分，极度控制人口（不禁想到了某些RTS探路失败作）。这一设计也是有一些优点的，那就是再也没有人海战术和后期一波推的路线，从而迫使玩家更加关注策略。
　　但这种看似新颖的玩火设计显然非常不成熟。
　　1.三种基地的选择更像是为了设计而设计，并没有完全突出三选一能带来的优势特点。选择路线后反而固定了套路，发展缺乏多样化，也失去了随时根据战局调整的可控性（虽然可以重新选择路线，不过只能在出生点降落的设计很让人绝望）。
　　2.在建筑直接砍掉的前提下，为了弥补游戏元素过少的不足，设计了并不精简的大量冗余兵种。兵种虽多，但由于人口的限制，游戏可控单位数量极少，以至于每个单位的兵种血量逆天，再加上极端的兵种克制，1个步兵被5辆坦克群殴10秒不死有时还能反杀的情况也是时常发生，不禁怀疑数值策划是不是在报复社会……

步子迈得太大容易扯到胯……大家RTS都玩微创新，不是没有道理，20多年积累下来的模式不是能轻易改变的。创新可以有，但在正统续作上实验，只能说胆识过人，但有勇无谋吧；市场和口碑的双重滑铁卢足以说明这是一次完全失败的冒险。

最后：怀念西木头。
（P.S. 光头的故事就这么随便结束了？不甘心！！！太TM糊弄事了吧！！！）","Not recommended. Out of 10, I'd give it a 5 (1 point for nostalgia).

The 2018 CNC series is over. I grew up playing Red Alert and have a deep affection for the series. After General 2's stillbirth, CNC 4 was destined to be the end of the series. I never expected the final game to be such a freak... (even though it took me years to complete the campaign).

First, let's talk about the quality of the finished game:

The plot is basically a piece of shit, and the production is nowhere near the level of the third game. The maps are awful, and the programming is incredibly sloppy (the terrain and unit collision detection is so annoying it makes me want to smash my keyboard, and there are all these air walls). Everyone can see that this ""legitimate sequel"" is anything but a genuine one. Every aspect reveals a low-budget rush job designed to fudge the nostalgia.

Now let's talk about the gameplay design:

This game is a radical departure from the previous games in the series—simplified construction and extreme population control (reminds me of some failed RTS exploration games). This design does have some advantages, namely, eliminating the need for massive crowds and late-game pushes, forcing players to focus more on strategy.

However, this seemingly novel, yet futile design is clearly immature.

1. The three base options seem designed for design's sake, failing to fully highlight the advantages of choosing one of the three. Choosing a base instead fixes the game's strategy, lacking in variety and controllability to adapt to the current situation (although you can re-select a new base, the design of being restricted to your spawn point is frustrating).

2. While buildings were eliminated, a large number of redundant units were added to compensate for the lack of gameplay elements. Despite the abundance of troop types, the limited population limits limit the number of controllable units in the game, resulting in incredibly high health pools for each unit. Coupled with the extreme class counterplay, it's not uncommon for a single infantryman to survive a 10-second assault by five tanks, sometimes even counter-killing them. I can't help but wonder if the numerical planners are taking revenge on society...

Taking too big a step can easily backfire... RTS games are all about micro-innovation, and for good reason. A formula built over 20 years can't be easily changed. Innovation is welcome, but experimenting with a sequel to a classic is bold but foolhardy. The dual failures in both market share and reputation clearly demonstrate that this venture was a complete failure.

Finally: I miss Westwood.

so was schelchtes hab ich schon lange nicht mehr gespielt, ansich is das gameplay ja ganz lustig, aber es kommt einfach nicht richtig motivation zusammen.
das die einheiten aufsteigen, ist ja ganz schön, jedach merkt man so gut wie nichts davon, das sie irgendwie stärker werden oder sonstige verbesserungen.
für mich ist allerdrings das schlimmste, das man von den crawlern(gebäude zu einheiten bau) jeweils nur einen bauen kann, sprich off, def und supp, dadruch auch andere einheiten bauen kann/muss, man könnte den crawler wechseln während des spieles, was aber schwachsinn ist weil nur off was bringt, dazu schwankt der schwierigkeitsgrad von missionen so sehr das man meint, man hat was falsch eingestellt.
für mich ist das spiel leider ne große enttäuschung und was mich zu diesem review veranlasst hat war eigentlich nur eine einheit die dermaßen geärgert hat, das mir der kragen geplatzt ist.
wie kann man denn nen trupp ins spiel einbauen, wohlgemerkt fußeinheit, die einfach deine panzer übernimmt obwohl fast 10 panzer auf ihn schießen und während er dir dann das teil klaut is er einfach nich down zu kriegen, so nimmt er sich stück für stück und du schießt eigene einheiten kaputt, ich flüchte doch nicht über die halbe karte mit panzern vor ""einer"" verdammten einheit, unfassbar.
wobei 10 panzer auch übertrieben is man kann ja nur 50-60 einheiten bauen und kein trup flug oder fahrzeug kostet weniger als 3 größere sogar 6, da kommt also nich viel zusammen zudem braucht man immer genügend rep einheiten.
naja glücklicherweise hat's mich nur 2,50€ gekostet.","Simply awful.

I haven't played anything this bad in a long time. The gameplay itself is quite fun, but it just doesn't really motivate me.
The fact that the units level up is nice, but you hardly notice them getting stronger or any other improvements.
For me, the worst thing is that you can only build one of the crawlers (buildings for units), i.e., off, defense, and support, which means you can/have to build other units. You could change crawlers during the game, but that's nonsense because only off is useful. On top of that, the difficulty of missions fluctuates so much that you think you've set something wrong.
Unfortunately, the game is a huge disappointment for me, and what prompted me to write this review was actually just one unit that annoyed me so much that I lost my temper. How can you integrate a squad into the game, mind you, a foot unit, that simply takes over your tanks even though almost 10 tanks are firing at it. And while it's stealing your tank, it's simply impossible to take down. It takes it piece by piece, and you destroy your own units. I'm not going to flee halfway across the map with tanks from ""one"" damn unit, unbelievable.
Although 10 tanks is also excessive. You can only build 50-60 units, and no squad, aircraft, or vehicles, costs less than 3, or even 6, so that doesn't add up to much. Plus, you always need enough rep units.
Well, luckily it only cost me €2.50."

Конечно отсутствие строительства распугало псевдо ""фанов"" C&C. Эти любители C&C 3 кукарекующие про легкость новой части, сами в большинстве своем не смогли пройти и пару уровней кампании. Эти любители C&C 3 даже не играли в Tiberium Dawn или Tiberium sun. Эти люди еще пытаются что то писать. Большинство плохих обзоров написано в 2010, эти аутисты еще не готовы были узнать, каким говном будет Generals 2(зато по пожеланиям тех самых любителей С&С 3). Хейт идиотов не готовых к новым концепциям положил конец C&C как таковому, разрабы уже бояться что то делать из-за хейта. Я сама олдфаг, и знаю все о C&C. Почему меня так не бомбит на новою концепцию, и почему ауты так дрочат на упрощенный C&C 3, где нет половины механики, что есть в Tiberium Sun. ХЕЙТ-НАХУЙ, игра годная, ауты не смогли в микро-контроль и ноют. Посмотрел бы я на них, и как бы они сосали в Tiberium Dawn.

Yes, the game's concept has changed, with an emphasis on micro-control, which is quite good. Of course, the lack of building has scared off the pseudo-fans of C&C. These C&C 3 fans crowing about how easy the new game is, for the most part, couldn't even get through a couple of campaign levels. These C&C 3 fans haven't even played Tiberium Dawn or Tiberium Sun. These people are still trying to write. Most of the bad reviews were written in 2010; these autists weren't yet ready to find out what a piece of crap Generals 2 would be (but it was made according to the wishes of those same C&C 3 fans). The hate from idiots unprepared for new concepts has put an end to C&C as such; the developers are now afraid to do anything because of the hate. I'm an oldfag myself, and I know everything about C&C. Why am I so unimpressed by the new concept, and why are the outcasts so obsessed with the simplified C&C 3, which lacks half the mechanics of Tiberium Sun? HATE! The game is decent, the outcasts couldn't handle micro-control and are whining. I'd love to see them suck at Tiberium Dawn.
P.S. The game is highly optimized; this isn't a 25 FPS release on Steam Early Access. Back in the day, the game ran on pretty outdated hardware.
P.S. People writing about it being too primitive are watching the ""group"" movements in SC2. Just kidding about F2."

Pros (the few the proud)
Its a newer take on a stratigy game.

It adds new units to the game.

Works well enough with friends.

I had no lag issues and minimal game crashs.

Fast unistall.

Cons (here we go)
Nothing like any of the other CnC games so I simply can't label it as CnC.

There are no counter units meaning you just have to guess what the enemy is building and build units accordingly.

No base building and no resource gathering which is the corner stone of the CnC universe in terms of gameplay.

Some units are either broken op or so underwelming its just stupid (like the commandos that used to be badass).

Its way over priced.

Gameplay is increadably repetative.

Graphics are subpar to say the least.

The story is the weakest the CnC series has ever had.

If you do play with people its either a steam rolling support that focuses damage or rushing assault. 

There is no balancing in my opinion between the classes. 

No more fight the enemy to the death its now just who can get the most points by capturing points of intrest around the map ( the very limited amounts of maps).

Slow install.

Nach vielen Jahren habe ich mir für 5 EUR dieses letzte Puzzlestück zu der tollen Tiberium-Reihe gekönnt, allen Unkenrufen zum Trotz... War ich seit Alarmstufe Rot völlig begeistert und habe seit den späten 90er Jahren alle C&C samt Addons regelmäßig gerne gespielt - sowohl die Missionen, als auch im Mehrspieler-Geplänkel.

RA 1 +2Addons - strategisch eines der besten
RA 2 +1Addon - das witzigste und einfachste zu ""Modden"" und mit FA2 zu ""mappen""
RA 3 +1Addon - hier schlägt es schon eine seltsame Richtung ein, allerdings gibt es eine super Mod, die Alarmstufe Rot 1 quasi auf die neue Engine portiert - top.
TD +1Addon - muss ich sagen, hat mich nie so begeistert, die Mechanik in RA war besser. Storytechnisch aber auch gut.
TS +1Addon - sowohl TiberianSun, als auch Firestorm sind meine absolute Favoriten, da strategisch mehr niemals mehr geboten wurde. Ver#nderbares Terrain, Untergrundeinheiten etc. Geiles Spiel - auch heute noch.
TW +1Addon - Meiner Meinung nach ist das der letzte Teil, der Tiberium-Saga, sowohl Storymäßig als auch grafisch und von der Mechanik. Die Dystopie aus TS/FS fehlt leider manchmal, aber dennoch ein sehr gutes Spiel.
Renegade und Generals lasse ich mal außen vor, da erstes ein FPS und zweites ein relativ realistisches gutes RTS-Game ist, aber mit CnC ebenfalls nicht wirklich etwas gemein hat.

=== Command & Conquer IV - Tiberian Twilight ===

Nach drei Stunden bereuhe ich den Kauf und möchte nicht mehr alles wiederholen, was bereits x Mal geschrieben wurde....

Kurzum:
Alles(!) was Command & Conquer ausgemacht hat, fehlt hier. Zwar wurde das seinerzeit zu Generals auch gesagt, doch Generals war ein echtes RTS - was man von TiberianTwilight nicht mal behaupten kann. Drei Produktionsstätten und irgendein mit XP-Punkten versehende Logik um Einheiten (begrenzt) bauen zu können. Wäre kein Joe C. ""Kane"" anwesend, in den wenigen Sequenzen, wüsste man nicht, dass man ein CnC in Händen hält.

Dämlich, nicht mal 5 EUR wert. Traurig, dass der gute Name von den Westwood Studios für dieses Machwerk missbraucht wurde. Wo CnC nun steht, wissen wir - im Regal bzw. als billiger Abklatsch als Free-To-Play-Variante...","Kane is dead - Kane lives - unfortunately, he's the only one still involved with Command & Conquer.

After many years, I managed to get this final piece of the puzzle of the great Tiberium series for €5, despite all the doom and gloom... I've been completely enthralled since Red Alert and have regularly enjoyed playing all Command & Conquer and its add-ons since the late 90s - both the missions and the multiplayer skirmishes.

RA 1 +2 add-ons - strategically one of the best
RA 2 +1 add-on - the funniest and easiest to ""mod"" and ""map"" with FA2
RA 3 +1 add-on - this is taking a rather strange direction, but there's a great mod that essentially ports Red Alert 1 to the new engine - top notch.
TD +1 add-on - I have to say, I was never that impressed; the mechanics in RA were better. Story-wise, though, it's also good.
TS +1 Add-on - Both Tiberian Sun and Firestorm are my absolute favorites, as they've never offered more strategically. Transformable terrain, underground units, etc. Awesome game - even today.
TW +1 Add-on - In my opinion, this is the final installment of the Tiberium saga, both in terms of story, graphics, and mechanics. The dystopia from TS/FS is unfortunately lacking at times, but it's still a very good game.
I'm leaving Renegade and Generals out of the equation, as the former is an FPS and the latter is a relatively realistic, good RTS game, but doesn't really have anything in common with Command & Conquer either.

=== Command & Conquer IV - Tiberian Twilight ===

After three hours, I regret the purchase and don't want to repeat everything that's already been written countless times....

In short:
Everything(!) that made Command & Conquer what it was is missing here. While that was said about Generals back then, Generals was a true RTS – something you can't even say about Tiberian Twilight. Three production sites and some kind of XP-based logic for building (limited) units. If Joe C. ""Kane"" weren't present in the few sequences, you wouldn't know you were holding a CnC in your hands.

Stupid, not even worth €5. It's sad that Westwood Studios abused its good name for this piece of work. We know where CnC stands now – on the shelves or as a cheap, free-to-play copy..."

De todos os C&Cs que já lançaram e que eu já joguei esse é de longe o único que não tem nada haver com a franquia, alias não devia nem ter o titulo de C&C, o modo skirmish que era tão foda de ficar batalhando entre as A.I para tentar derrotar todas e controlar o mapa todo agora virou um modo estilo Conquest, não tem coleta de recurso igual seus antecessores, o sistema de upgrade é uma Me#$% foge completamente do contesto de um jogo RTS na qual somente upando de level que você consegue liberar tropas e tecnologias, você pode escolher entre 3 classes(defense, support e offense) para jogar e com diferentes unidades cada classe, necessário estar online sempre e caso a conexão cair você perde todo o progesso, fico triste ao saber que uma franquia tão memorável como C&C acabou tomando o rumo errado e teve esse fim completamente decepcionante .

Essa é minha opinião, fique livre para criticar e opinar.

Às vezes fico pensando se tal rumo não tivesse sido tomado quantos C&Cs já teriam sido lançados e quais seriam seus títulos tipo ex: C&C: Origins of Scrin, C&C: The Battle for Earth, C&C: The other race.","I bought it because I've been a fan of the C&C franchise since the PS1.

Of all the C&C games I've ever played, this is by far the only one that has nothing to do with the franchise. In fact, it shouldn't even be called C&C. The skirmish mode, which was so awesome, where you battled AIs to defeat them all and control the entire map, has now become a Conquest-style mode. There's no resource gathering like its predecessors. The upgrade system is a complete mess, completely out of keeping with the context of an RTS game, where you can only unlock troops and technologies by leveling up. You can choose between three classes (defense, support, and offense) to play, with different units for each class. You need to be online constantly, and if your connection drops, you lose all your progress. I'm sad to hear that such a memorable franchise as C&C ended up taking the wrong path and having such a disappointing ending.

This is my opinion; feel free to criticize and share your opinion.

Sometimes I wonder if this direction hadn't been taken, how many C&Cs would have already been released and what their titles would be, e.g.: C&C: Origins of Scrin, C&C: The Battle for Earth, C&C: The other race."

Then we hit this...this slop. If you are here for the story I suggest you find it elsewhere for Tiberium Twilight will make you hate yourself.

22130432,french,2016.02.30 00:17,❌,✅,0.8976162076,155,"Si vous êtes fan de la série C&C, n'acheter pas cet opus, car vous allez être aussi triste que si on vous dit que vos parents sont morts. Le plus gros problème selon moi est l'absense total d'un vrai gameplay de C&C comme on aime.

Premièrement, les unités ne vienne pas de la même façon que les autres opus. Dans cette merde, vous devez montez votre niveau global du jeu pour avoir les meilleurs unités et améliorations d'unités. Donc si vous êtes nouveau à ce jeu et que vous jouez en ligne contre un joueur niveau max, vous allez en chier une bonne. En plus, votre niveau ''global'' n'est pas vraiment global, car votre lvl augmente seulement dans la faction dont vous jouez. C'est à dire que si vous jouez avec le GDI, le Nod va rester à son niveau actuel. 

Deuxièmement, vous n'avez QU'UNE SEULE structure. Vous ne pouvez pas construire par exemple des centrales pour votre énergie parce que vous en avez pas besoin. Les seules structure qu'on peut fabriquer sont les tourelles et autres défenses. Autrement dit, tout ce fait avec votre unique base (appelé Crawler) : création d'unité, amélioration, etc... et sérieusement, je trouve cela vraiment médiocre.

Finalement, le truc qu'on a tous besoin dans tous les RTS est bien sûr la gestion des ressources. Dans ce jeu, il n'y en a pas. Le tiberium, seule ressource du jeu, n'existe plus. D'accord j'avoue qu'il en a encore dans le jeux, mais ça sert seulement à faire avancé vos amélioration plus rapidement. les parties ressemblent plus à du spam de création d'unité. La stratégie n'existe plus dans C&C 4.

Pour conclure, ce jeu est mauvais. Il y a d'autre chose que je n'ai pas parlé comme la sorte de classe que vous pouvez prendre: attaque, défense et soutien. Je trouve cette idée vraiment nulle, parce que vous n'avez pas toutes les variations d'unité (exemple : pour avoir des unités aériennes il faut être soutien). Franchement, j'avais acheté cet opus seulement pour connaître le reste de l'histoire, mais j'ai pas réussi à le finir à cause du gameplay pourri qui me dégoûte. Même en rabais je le déconseille. Ce jeu est la définition même de la déception.","If you're a fan of the C&C series, don't buy this game, because you'll be as sad as if someone told you your parents died. The biggest problem, in my opinion, is the complete lack of true C&C gameplay, the way we love it.

First, units don't come in the same way as in other games. In this game, you have to raise your overall game level to get the best units and unit upgrades. So if you're new to this game and you're playing online against a max-level player, you're going to have a hard time. Furthermore, your ""overall"" level isn't really global, because your level only increases in the faction you play as. Meaning, if you play with GDI, Nod will stay at its current level.

Second, you only have ONE structure. You can't build power plants, for example, because you don't need them. The only structures you can build are turrets and other defenses. In other words, everything is done with your single base (called a Crawler): unit creation, upgrades, etc., and seriously, I find it really mediocre.

Ultimately, the thing we all need in all RTS games is, of course, resource management. In this game, there isn't any. Tiberium, the game's only resource, no longer exists. Okay, I admit it's still in the game, but it only serves to speed up your upgrades. Games feel more like unit creation spam. Strategy no longer exists in C&C 4.

In conclusion, this game is bad. There's something else I didn't mention, like the type of class you can take: offense, defense, and support. I find this idea really bad, because you don't have all the unit variations (for example, to have air units, you have to be a support). Honestly, I bought this game just to experience the rest of the story, but I couldn't finish it because of the crappy gameplay that disgusted me. Even on sale, I wouldn't recommend it. This game is the very definition of disappointment."

Ici, vous avez ... 3 mega-méca que vous pouvez appeler un à la fois (c'est votre véhicule de construction mobile), chacun a sa propre spécialisation, donc ses propres unités ... donc c'est mort, c'est nul, putain rendez-nous les canons à Ions, les bombes atomiques, les unités lance-flammes, les commandos avec leur phrase fun genre ""Tiens, j'ai un petit cadeau pour toi"".

The only reason i give this game a positive rating is because i had a tons of fun and positive memories playing it with my friends in coop/compstomp and just skirmish with AI. If you play this game without thinking about past C&C games, it's actually fine, runs great, plays great, looks great. Let's do a breakdown :

Reasons to buy it [b][i]( only if it's on huge sale[strike] and you are desperate[/strike] )[/i][/b] :

 - Tons of fun in COOP with friends or vs AI alone.
 - Very pretty environmental/map design.
 - Sometimes it's very challenging.
 - Visuals.
 - 5v5 players possible.

Reasons to avoid it and tell me that i am stupid for giving it a positive rating :

 - Abysmal plot written by a madman in a few hours. Probably taken from DeviantArt fanfiction section.
 - Questionable units design.
 - Horrible FMV actors performance.
 - There is almost no way to beat campaign alone, it's designed to be beaten in COOP.
 - Unit cap.
 - Has almost nothing to do with C&C, hence no base building or tiberium harvesting.
 - The ending cutscene ( which is the finale of whole C&C series presumably ) is so horrible that you might want to kys after it.
 - Most of the super/special weapons feel weak.
 - You need to unlock units in order to use them.


If reasons to avoid it don't scare you + it's on a huge sale and you have a friend to play it with - then you might want to get it just for collection and full playthrough with people you know. If you're looking for extra content for it - don't. Game doesn't have mod support, but it does have few custom maps.

But if you want some more good old C&C - don't get it, it's not C&C, it won't be fun for you, infact it might leave you with few dead brain cells, just like me.","This is not your typical C&C by any means, the rumors say that this was EA's attempt to push C&C to eSports, but because market was overwhelmed by MOBAs and other quality RTS games, they decided to slap 4 and ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE story on it to lure in loyal C&C fans, and the final product we have now does look and play exactly like it was initially planned to be.

In Nov 2017, I paid 63 cent for the game in a sale and it worked fine once I'd input the game key, created a profile at EA games and logged in and played for a couple of hours... here's what I found:

The UI is a thing of nightmares and so full of glitches, you'd need Yuri Prime's psychic ability to directly access the developers mind on how it works.
The game perspective is so near, with a zoom so limited, that you can only go from viewing nasal hair, out to the blackheads covering the nose of a particularly grubby Zone-trooper.
Not that viewing the game is necessary as only being able to produce a handful of units, buildings, etc. due to the tiny resource caps, that you may as well keep the mouse button constantly clicking to make new units as the old ones get destroyed as soon as they emerge.
As for unit capabilities, you can go from nerf to fluffy kitten in a single bound, rendering the entire enterprise as challenging as going for a poo having eaten six buckets of yogurt.
Not that you should bother playing the game at all, as the concept of game-play seems to have eluded the developers who must have been so high on LSD they thought a table leg was interesting.

ЭТА ИГРА ДЛЯ ВАС

Плюсы:

Завершение истории не смотря на кучу оставшихся вопросов

Наличие мозга не обязательно

Лысина Кейна

Панацея от игровой зависимости

Незабываемый опыт  - ДА игра действительна вызывает эмоции. Боль, гнев, чувство бесконечного осознания собственной ничтожности и важности твоего мнения как потребителя для злобных корпораций. Всю прелесть космических путешествий,изучения и познания нашей вселенной на личном транспортном средстве - горящая жо""па. Действительно не то что ты мог ожидать от развлекательной продукции, но хей по крайней мере это не бездушный трипл А а игра дарящая эмоции. 

Что бы зайти в игру нужно конкретно потрудится с регистрациями итд итп в случае переустановки еще и проблема с повторной активацией продукта казалось огромный минус и не удобство НО я верю что компания ЕА заботится о вашем здоровье и всячески усложняет вам доступ к этому продукту потому записываю в плюс

Возможность скипнуть заставку ЕА

Минусы:

Не игра - ЭТО прошло контроль качества кампании EA что очень пугает меня даже спустя 5 лет

Нет экономики - да во многих играх ее нет но там хоть есть игра

Краулеры - Есть 3 вида атакующий и 2 бесполезных

Разделение шагалок - кроме бесполезности всего кроме атакующего нет возможности комбинировать войска каждая шагалка рожает только один род войск тоесть по факту у вас даже не передвижная база а ТОЛЬКО военный завод\казарма\аэродром

Армия - Лимит юнитов смехотворен и странное чувство что в 95 я мог построить больше юнитов чем в 2010 не давало покоя.

Геймплей - вся игра сводится к тому что нужно дойти до места и родить юнитов, в случае если задача уничтожить врага нужно сесть своей хреновиной рядом с вражеской и смотреть как две херовины рожают юнитов в жалких попытках уничтожить друг друга

Динамичность - поймите меня правильно смотреть как два юнита стреляют друг в друга по 2 минуты не то что бы увлекательное действие 

Вторичность - в каждой серии игры так или иначе был виден технологический прогресс человечества за время нашего отсутствия но видимо в ЕА решили что ""нет игры - нет прогресса"" и юниты не то что бы изменились с момента 3 части большенство из них стали даже хуже. Видимо с момента последней войны все малость подзабили на тех обслуживание или типа того) нет конечно же некоторые юниты кочуют по играм серии с первой части но даже в них чувствуется развитие технологий. Тут нам предлогают все тоже самое + штучную пехоту( что на мой взгляд конкретный шаг назад на фоне 3 части)
Так же и замут с протоганистом искуственным интелектом как то в этот раз не зашел.
А глядя на полоски захвата стратегических пунктов упорно пытаешься найти значки Альянса и Орды
Однообразные задачи на протяжении всей игры которые прекрасно дополняют однообразный геймплей

Дегродация качества  - У нас в 3 части был в полне приличный перевод даже названия GDI(ГСБ)Глобальный Совет Безопасности и вообще качество работы Актеров озвучки на весьма приличном уровне. Актерам озвучки видимо давали сначало демо версию игры ибо желания работать (а может быть даже и жить) в их творчестве не чувствуется. В этой  поделке видимо даже локализаторы прошли контроль качества EA(Вместе со сценаристами, и тем человеком который решил отказатсья от основ C&C и переработать из стратегии в говно И мужик который накурил всех паленым красным тиберием...и секретарша которая не дала босу и он решил отомстить человечеству создав ЭТО в волнующем приходе от красного) - ибо только им одним ведомо как то же самое GDI(ГДИ) расшифровать адекватному русскоязычному человеку. Выдать говно за игру. Раскрутить ее так что люди это купят. И впервые в жизни не соврать с названием - это действительно закат....

Знаком с предыдущими продуктами серии - без коментариев просто плачу о покинувшей нас серии 

Стоимость - они хотят денег за то что убили великую RTS  и в итоге превратили ее в ср""ную браузерку

Оценка: Сотрите мне память из 10","If you want to be completely disillusioned with RTS

If you're suffering from your love of strategy games and can't play shooters or any other game genre
If you're drawn to BDSM but have always been afraid to try
If you enjoy an autistic style of play
If your child has become addicted to computer games and dropped out of school
If you're completely disillusioned with humanity and are searching for the bottom and depth of its decline
THIS GAME IS FOR YOU

Pros:

Completion of the story despite a mountain of unanswered questions

A brain isn't necessary

Kane's Bald Head

A cure for gaming addiction

An unforgettable experience - YES, the game really does evoke emotions. Pain, anger, a feeling of endless awareness of your own insignificance and the importance of your opinion as a consumer to evil corporations. The whole charm of space travel, exploring and understanding our universe in a personal vehicle, is a total pain. It's really not what you'd expect from an entertainment product, but hey, at least it's not a soulless Triple A, but a game that gives you emotions.

To access the game, you have to really work with registrations, etc., etc. In case of reinstallation, the problem with reactivating the product seemed like a huge drawback and inconvenience. BUT, I believe EA cares about your health and makes it difficult for you to access this product in every possible way, so I consider it a plus.

Ability to skip the EA intro.

Cons:

It's not a game - THIS has passed EA's quality control, which still scares me even after 5 years.

No economy - many games don't have one, but at least there's a game.

Crawlers - There are 3 types, attacking and 2 useless.

Separation of walkers - there's no option for anything other than attacking, which is useless. Combining troops: Each walker produces only one type of troops, meaning you don't even have a mobile base, but ONLY a military factory/barracks/airfield.

Army - The unit limit is ridiculous, and the strange feeling that in 1995 I could build more units than in 2010 haunted me.

Gameplay - The whole game boils down to getting to a location and generating units. If the goal is to destroy the enemy, you have to sit your thing next to the enemy's and watch as the two things generate units in a pathetic attempt to destroy each other.

Dynamism - Don't get me wrong, watching two units shoot at each other for two minutes isn't exactly engaging.

Repetition - Each game series has, in one way or another, demonstrated humanity's technological progress during our absence, but apparently EA decided that ""no game, no progress,"" and the units haven't really changed. Since Part 3, most of them have even gotten worse. Apparently, since the last war, everyone has been a bit lax about maintenance or something. Of course, some units have been reused from the first game in the series, but even in them, technological advancement is felt. Here, we're offered the same old stuff, plus individual infantry (which, in my opinion, is a definite step backwards compared to Part 3).
Also, the idea of ​​the AI-powered Protoganist somehow didn't work this time around.
And looking at the strategic point capture bars, you stubbornly try to find the Alliance and Horde icons.
Repetitive tasks throughout the game, which perfectly complement the monotonous gameplay.

Degradation of quality - In Part 3, we even had a perfectly decent translation of the name GDI (Global Security Council), and the overall quality of the voice actors' work is quite decent. The voice actors were apparently given a demo version of the game first, because they didn't want to work (and maybe even live) in their work. It doesn't feel right. Apparently, even the localizers passed EA's quality control in this piece of crap (along with the writers, and the guy who decided to abandon the foundations of C&C and turn it from a strategy game into crap, and the guy who got everyone high on red Tiberium... and the secretary who didn't let her boss have it, so he decided to take revenge on humanity by creating THIS in a thrilling high from red) - because only they know how to decipher that same GDI for a reasonable Russian-speaking person. Pass off crap as a game. Promote it so people will buy it. And for the first time in their life, they can't lie about the title - this is truly the end...

I'm familiar with the previous products in the series - without comment, I'm just crying about the series that's gone.

Price - they want money for killing a great RTS and ultimately turning it into a shitty browser game.

[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/24810]Command & Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath Review[/url]

[h1]INTRODUCTION:[/h1]
Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight is a real-time strategy game developed and published by Electronic Arts. This title serves as the official sequel to the critically acclaimed C&C 3: Tiberium Wars  and acts as the final chapter in the decade and a half long Command & Conquer Tiberian franchise.

[h1]PLOT (No Spoilers):[/h1]
The story picks up 15 years after the end of Command & Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath. The Scrin has been defeated, Kane has successfully recovered the Tacitus and the Brotherhood of NOD is merely a shadow of its former self. Despite the Scrin's failed invasion, all is not well as Tiberium now spreads in an ever more rapid rate and human extinction is almost inevitable. The game starts with Kane offering the remaining world leaders a solution to this problem.

[h1]PROS:[/h1]
+ Return of live action cinematics but...(See CON #1)
+ Good sound effects and voice acting
+ Interesting veterancy system with visual upgrade changes for each level of veterancy
+ Good special effects and graphics (but average art style)
+ Interesting new units

[h1]CONS:[/h1]
- [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=522954423]Poor costume quality for the live action cutscenes[/url]
- No base building
- No resource gathering
- DRM Stacking (Always Online + Log-in requirement every time you start the game)
- Unlock and account level up system that ruins the game's unit availability: (meaning you can't jump to multiplayer immediately because half of your units are locked.)
- Population Cap
- The game is lore deficient, with a rushed and confusing story
- Poorly written and poorly executed attempt to establish “emotional depth” by giving the Commander a wife that most players won't care about.
- Lack of mission variety and the fun stealth missions were completely removed
- No side bar like the old games; the entire UI looks bad as a whole
- Too much deviation from the C&C source material meaning it neither look nor feel like a C&C game
- Ridiculously low damage and high HP for every unit that results in...(See next CON)
- VERY slow paced action
- Pathfinding problems
- Severe balance issues
- Very short campaign time
- Small and poorly designed campaign maps
- The game as a whole feels rushed and cheap

[h1]NEUTRAL:[/h1]
+/- The 'Crawler / MCV' unit building system is an interesting idea but it shouldn't have been implemented on an already existing franchise such as C&C because it already has an established (and working) formula.

[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]
A [b]VERY BAD[/b] sequel which stands as an insult to the fans of a 15 year old franchise. In EA's attempt to “innovate,” they failed to see what made the Command and Conquer games fun for a lot of people.

[h1]WORTH IT?[/h1]
[b]NO,[/b] the game is not worth it. I would [b]not recommend[/b] this game to anyone even on a sale, specially if you're a fan of the old games. You're better off buying the previous titles like [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/24790/]Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars[/url] and its [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/24810/]expansion[/url].

[h1]FINAL NOTES:[/h1]
I would have been kinder in my criticism of this game if it did not have the Command and Conquer name on it. Tiberian Twilight would have sold better and would have been received better by the community if it was merely a spin-off rather than the finale of the franchise.

[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFXJaYY0TOs]This video[/url] expresses clearly what I feel about this game.

17341271,french,2015.07.02 03:21,✅,✅,0.4683279991,12,"Après avoir vue différents point de vue, je décide de revenir sur mon évaluation, qui j'admets était trop agressive :)

Je ne suis pas un grand joueur de STR, je joue plus pour le fun que pour la compétition, je n'ai pas joué aux autres Command and conquer, mais je connais les personnages et 
les factions.

[b] Le jeu:[/b]

C'est un STR, avec une toute nouvelle forme de gameplay qui a déplu à la majorité de la communauté, les Crawlers.
Des machines mobiles servant de QG, elle permet de générer différentes unités, de gérer des améliorations, et des constructions pour les crawlers défensifs.
Donc plus de bâtiment, (sauf pour le crawler défensif).

La gameplay est assez simpliste, chaque unité à une unité de faiblesse qui est indiqué sur sa petite ""fiche de présentation"" en jeu, avec les hp.

Cependant, malgrès que j'apprécie ce jeu, il à beaucoup de mauvais aspect de mon point de vue pour le gameplay:

-La récupération de tibérium, affreusement DURE, qui encourage les joueurs à build des petites unité à bas coup et rapide pour aller embêter les autres joueurs dans
cette récupération, essentielle pour la late game. Systéme de récupération qui a d'ailleurs aussi changé par rapport aux autres Command and Conquer.

-Systéme de snowball trop présent, un mauvais coup et pour remonter bonne chance.

-Trop peu d'unité total sur le terrain à mon goût, 4 juges même pas tous remplies de Devot.

Les mécaniques ont beaucoup changé par rapport aux autres Command and Conquer, cependant j'apprécie les cinématiques, la bande son, les voix en Français, les personnages.

Peut-être que je suis resté bloqué sur ça, que pour moi le seul fait de voir des personnages que j'apprécie dans un jeu qu'il soit bon ou mauvais me suffit à l'apprécier.

J'ai une bonne expérience sur ce jeu auquel j'ai joué un moment avec un ami, l'univers m'a plu, mais je comprends tout à fait qu'il n'ait pas satisfait les anciens joueurs de 
Command and Conquer, étant moi même très sceptique aux changements.

En éspérant encore et toujours une suite. :)","After considering different points of view, I decided to reconsider my assessment, which I admit was too aggressive :)

I'm not a big RTS player; I play more for fun than for competition. I haven't played the other Command & Conquer games, but I know the characters and
the factions.

[b]The Game:[/b]

It's an RTS, with a completely new form of gameplay that displeased the majority of the community: the Crawlers.
Mobile machines serving as headquarters allow you to generate different units, manage upgrades, and build buildings for the defensive crawlers.
So, no more buildings (except for the defensive crawler).

The gameplay is quite simplistic; each unit has a weakness, which is indicated on its little ""presentation sheet"" in the game, along with its HP.

However, despite my enjoyment of this game, it has many negative aspects from my perspective in terms of gameplay:

-Tiberium recovery is horribly HARD, encouraging players to build small, fast, low-impact units to annoy other players in this recovery, essential for the late game. The recovery system has also changed compared to other Command & Conquer games.

-Snowball system is too prevalent; one bad hit and good luck getting back on track.

-Too few units on the field for my taste; not even all four judges are full of Devotees.

The mechanics have changed a lot compared to other Command & Conquer games, but I appreciate the cutscenes, the soundtrack, the French voices, and the characters.

Maybe I've gotten stuck on that, that for me, just seeing characters I like in a game, whether good or bad, is enough to make me enjoy it.

I had a good experience with this game, which I played for a while with a friend. I liked the setting, but I completely understand why it didn't satisfy former Command and Conquer players, being myself very skeptical of changes.

Still hoping for a sequel. :)"

Lets start with the most glaringly obvious one which i think everyone feels the same and that's the campaign... This had to be written by some emotionless, imbecilic monkey. It literally starts off going THIS NAMELESS CHARACTER IS YOUR WIFE CARE ABOUT HER!!!! (uhhh okay???) Okay seriously why would I care about this character, I've literally never seen them before but the game just expects you to care about her and really really obnoxiously tries shove it down your throat it's insane because aboviously they're going to use her as a plot device. I think a bloody 5 year old can figure that out.
The campaign is insanely short as well I completed the whole thing in about 2.5 hours, that's it... the whole thing.. and like an hour of it is a tutorial. It ends so suddenly as well I was like wait is that it. I just did like 4 missions after the tutorial crap and then poof, done, over. I can only imagine that they were planning on bringing out a tonne of garbage DLC for this just to unlock more campaign missions.

Now for the Gameplay... 
It's terrible just flat out terrible, it's watered down from other games and lacks any sort of depth or strategy.
This is literally it it, You start off with your main ""structure"" called a Crawler, now you move your crawler to whatever objective you have which is either one of 3 things: Capture thing, kill thing or Defend thing. (defending thing being the most annoying since you have no control over said thing it will generally just run into things and get itself killed, it's like ""Hay you know what would be a fun idea, lets walk face first into that big horde of enemies over there. I'm sure things will be completely fine!""). Now as I was saying here's what the gameplay is: Move Crawler to objective, Deploy Crawler, Throw shit at problem until it goes away, move to next objective. That's it, that's all I did, I didn't have to care about what units I built since all i had to do is build the spider tanks with the big ass tesla coil and throw them at the enemy, I didn't even have to worry about them dying since if you build like 3 or 4 engineers everything you have is pretty much immortal anyway. i didn't even have to worry about my base since there's no base building to worry about and the base came with me anyway so screw defenses. Oh and for tech it's literally hay see that red crystal over there? yeah pic that up like 1 or 2 of them and you can INSTANTLY unlock every single bit of tech you want.

Jeder der C&C liebt sollte sich diesen teil nicht kaufen weil es einfach kein C&C ist.

Einheiten limit - seit wann das? Das geht gar nicht !!!!!
Taktik - brauchst du keine, man muss nur darauf achten das immer einheiten gebaut werden.
Grafik - war schon viel besser (achtung, Augenkrebsgefahr :-/ ).
Musik - die musik ist einfach eine endlosschleife die gefühlt 10 sekunden sich zu wiederholen scheint.
Sounds - war schon viel besser
Interface - viele Schaltflächen die man erst benutzen darf wenn man weiter ist.
Die Einheiten - Quantität statt Qualität so sieht ein futuristischer Krieg sicher nicht aus (nicht vergessen 50 Einheiten limit, 5 Panzer und schluss). Meiner meinung viel zu viele verschiedene Typen die alle irgendwie nix drauf haben. Übergroße mega Kanonen haben sie alle die minmal schaden machen (soll das witzig sein?)
Baubare Gebäude - gibt es eigentlich keine.
Gameplay - Einheiten bauen bauen bauen bauen bauen bauen bauen und das beste sie kosten nicht mal was weil sowas wie einen Sammler braucht man nicht weil es gar nix zu sammeln gibt!

Ne mal ganz im ernst.
Wenn ich gewusst hätte wie sch***** (sry) der Teil von C&C ist und ich nicht so voreilig auf das Angebot reingefallen wäre, dann hätte ich das game nie gekauft.

Command and Conquer R.I.P.
","I've only played for a little over two hours, but I've had enough! I'm fed up with this ""game.""

Anyone who loves C&C shouldn't buy this because it simply isn't C&C.

Unit limit - since when? That's not possible!!!!!
Tactics - you don't need them, you just have to make sure units are always being built.
Graphics - were much better (warning, risk of eye cancer :-/ ).
Music - the music is just an endless loop that seems to repeat for what feels like 10 seconds.
Sounds - were much better.
Interface - lots of buttons that you can only use once you've progressed.
The units - quantity over quality - that's certainly not what a futuristic war looks like (don't forget the 50 unit limit, 5 tanks, and that's it). In my opinion, there are far too many different types that somehow don't have any skills. They all have oversized mega cannons that do minimal damage (is that supposed to be funny?)
Buildable buildings - there aren't actually any.
Gameplay - units build build build build build build build and the best part is, they don't even cost anything because you don't need something like a collector because there's nothing to collect!

No, seriously.
If I'd known how crap (sorry) that part of C&C was and hadn't been so quick to fall for the offer, I would never have bought the game.

Die Story war auch ganz witzig, das Technoflair stimmig, und alles in allem ein wirklich hübsches Spiel.

Tja, jetzt war Teil 4 im Sale, und ich dachte mir, schau Dir mal an, wie C&C heute so in modern aussieht. Aber gleich vorweg - was auch immer EA aus C&C gemacht hat, es ist nicht mehr C&C...

Es gibt ein Einheitenlimit, und man kann keine Basis/Gebäude bauen - man platziert einfach sein MBF irgendwo auf einer vordefinierten Fläche, gibt ihm eine von drei taktischen Ausrichtungen (offensiv/defensiv/Unterstützung), und spamt dann nur noch Einheiten. Eine richtig schöne Masse wie bei den alten Teilen kommt dank des strengen Einheitenlimits aber trotzdem nicht zusammen, und so wird einem das Leben künstlich schwer gemacht. Taktikverständnis wird im Prinzip nicht gebraucht, es ist mehr wie ein modernes Clickergame.

Ich hatte gelesen, dass die Kampagne sehr kurz sein soll (es sind wohl 2x7 Missionen), und dachte noch, das halte ich durch. Habe jetzt bei Mission 5 aufgehört und werde stattdessen eine Wand streichen gehen. Der Farbe beim Trocknen zuzusehen macht nämlich viel mehr Spaß als C&C 4...

Bleibt nur noch anzufügen: Schade um den Klassiker. EA ist ein echter Sensenmann der Spielkultur...","I was never a big fan of the C&C series, but spamming a few tanks and blasting enemies in C&C 1 or RA was always fun. The story was also quite funny, the techno flair was fitting, and all in all, a really nice game.

Well, part 4 was on sale, and I thought, let's see what C&C looks like today in a modern version. But first of all – whatever EA has done with C&C, it's not C&C anymore...

There's a unit limit, and you can't build a base/building – you simply place your MBF somewhere on a predefined area, give it one of three tactical orientations (offensive/defensive/support), and then just spam units. However, thanks to the strict unit limit, you still can't build a really nice crowd like in the old games, and so life is artificially made difficult. Tactical understanding is basically not required; it's more like a modern clicker game.

I'd read that the campaign was supposed to be very short (it's apparently 2x7 missions), and I thought I could handle it. I've stopped at mission 5 and am going to paint a wall instead. Watching the paint dry is way more fun than C&C 4...

All that remains to be said is: What a pity for this classic. EA is a true grim reaper of gaming culture..."

……玩过大概20H,明白为什么叫它WTF了，怒删都难以发泄我现在的心情。.蛋疼的人口和等级设定,本来就不想玩久只想速通战役还要在遭遇战上花几个小时刷等级。ai上NOD支援只会出眼镜蛇，对上GDI支援就算是凶残打简单也是被吊打。还有就是万年不变的网络链接问题，连不上服务器意味着游戏也玩不了，好歹你设一个离线模式不行么。最后我想吐槽剧情，朋友说4代剧情渣得要死，个人感觉剧情主线还可以，但就是糟糕的叙事硬-生-生把一个本来至少可称优秀的剧情给毁-掉-了。其他要吐槽的地方我都记不清了。只想说一句——把我的C&C还给我！
      最后客观说一句，这游戏概念和质量其实还是不错的，错就错在他的名字是C&C。要是你喜欢魔兽什么的微操，或者说今年那个灰蛊的小规模战斗，那么这游戏还是适合你。但如果你是因为它是C&C而来，恐怕你要失望了，不建议入，否则会颠覆你的世界观的。当然你说信仰喜+1什么的我也阻止不了你，就像我当时瞎了眼没有管下面一大波红色评价并阻止自己剁手一样。","Despite reading so many negative reviews, I still bought into C&C out of faith... I got stuck at the login screen from the start, unable to connect to the server. I couldn't even play the campaign. ""AE, you're fucking kidding me!"" I'm not in a position to judge the game's content, but having to connect to such a crappy server every time is unbearable.

…… ... Finally, I want to complain about the plot. A friend said the plot of the fourth game was terrible. Personally, I think the main storyline was okay, but the poor narrative ruined what could have been at least a good story. I can't remember anything else I wanted to complain about. All I can say is—give me back my C&C!

Finally, objectively speaking, the concept and quality of this game are actually quite good. The only problem is the name C&C. If you like micromanagement like in World of Warcraft, or the small-scale battles of this year's Grey Goo, then this game is for you. But if you came for C&C, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

Yes, EA do what they typically do and use a name to sell a game that's completely different from what is expected of it. It probably should have been an offshoot instead of a sequel. If you can ignore that then it's not that bad of a game and has no serious technical problems.

The game is basically just dumbed down and casualised RTS that's good for playing for 30 minutes. All the more complex aspects such as base and resource management are thrown away leaving you with the job of looking after 1 master unit, the Crawler. You collect Tiberium crystals to receive upgrade points and when the Crawler is destroyed it respawns at a drop off point. The Defense type can construct buildings but only buildings such as the Obelisk and Nuke/Ion Cannon which require the Crawler to be alive to operate. Support buildings can also be captured but cannot be destroyed.

I completed the campaign and played some skirmishes. The skirmish mode is a little shallow and some extra customization would have made it much better such as increasing the unit limit for games with more players. I'm going to give it a thumbs up for that at least. If you want or expect a traditional C&C experience then don't get it and stick to C&C 3 or the older games.","I actually quite enjoyed playing this despite the bad publicity it has.

Many people gave this game a bad review because the many changes in the game formula. Is fair to say that this is not a sequel to Command & Conquer, It is much more like a action strategy spin-off. 

That is not the reason why this game is bad, but here are some reasons why you should not buy it:

- Permanent online connection require to play. In the middle of the campaign EA servers went down and now i simply can't play until they decide to go back up. Now i am here, angry, writing a review.

- Requires you to login and input your password every time you start the game.

- Unskippable cutscenes

- Lack of mission variety, is most of the time build troops and walk around the map destroying everything in empty skirmishers style maps. Is really hard to believe that this game was released in the same year that Starcraft 2 came out.

- The new mechanics are really average, there is not much do to. They cut out resource collection, all you do is choose the appropriate MCV to the situation and walk with your troops.

- Units are ultra resilient. It may take minutes of firing to kill an enemy armada. Combat is not fun.

14583167,spanish,2015.01.22 01:11,❌,✅,0.9213665724,241,"En el 2012, me acuerdo cuando en el blog de una cosplayer de España había debatído sobre el final de Mass Effect 3, el cual le parecía injusto que el final decepcionara tanto. Yo le había respondido ""Si eso es lo único que te ha decepcionado de EA, es porque no has visto el final de Command & Conquer 4. Eso SI que es una verdadera decepcion"". Si despues de eso, no ha jugado a esto, espero haberle hecho de alguna forma un favor invirtiendo su tiempo mejor en otra cosa mas interesante, como mirar un muro, por ejemplo xD.

Lo que voy a contar lo digo desde el punto de vista de fan de la saga. Aquella franquicia que me hizo fan de PC por excelencia (mucho antes de Starcraft, Max Payne, KotOR, Medal of Honor, etc) fue, sin duda, Command & Conquer (C&C), mas o menos la 1era instancia para MS-DOS allá por el 1995. Asi que me voy a tomar un tiempo en explicar el drama que aqueja a semejante monstruo que es esto.

Durante la franquicia, su antigua desarrolladora (Westwood Studios, el cual a fines de 1999 fue absorvida por EA) había generado 2 lineas temporales: la 1era basada en la guerra fria entre las potencias occidentales Vs. La Unión Sovietica (URSS) y la 2da en la que se basaba originariamente C&C:  El universo de Tiberium.

 Para hacerlo breve: en la decada del 90 en Europa del Este cae un meteorito con un mineral verde llamado Tiberium el cual empieza a esparcirse por todo el continente, y que consume los recursos y minerales de la Tierra, no obstante, su letalidad con todo ente biótico con que entre en contacto tambien es consumido por el cristal, lo que genera una amenaza grave para la sociedad mundial. Es entonces cuando surge del anonimato una sociedad secreta que adoraba al cristal, conocido como la Hermandad de Nod, liderada por un sujeto megalómano conocido como Kane (el cual se lo considera el mesias, había predicado la nueva era de tiberium para la humanidad, etc. No muere realmente en casi ningun juego). la ONU, para contrarestar a esta organización de que asimilen para ellos solos el cristal, genera una división militar internacional contra el terrorismo conocido como la GDI o Global Defense Initiative. Posterior a esto, entre estas facciónes se generan 3 guerras mundiales (que vendrían a hacer cada C&C de Tiberium) en el que la cantidad de muertos se cuentan por millones, mientras el tiberium casi consume todo el planeta, destruyendo ecosistemas y extinguiendo al ser humano a la par de los conflictos bélicos.

Y es aquí en el que entra la descripcion de este juego. en el 2062, casi 15 años despues de Tiberium Wars. El mundo esta casi totalmente devastado por tiberium, y la extinción de la especie humana es casi inminente... pero un día Kane, se levanta de su siesta, escuchando Joan Manuel Serrat al canto de ""Hoy puede ser un gran día"", va  a hacer una visita a los directivos de la GDI y les plantea un plan para salvar al mundo del cristal verde y que sean todos hippies, y así salvar la humanidad....

... tiene sentido? por supuesto que no. Pero bueno, sacando el sarcasmo, esto es lo que pasó realmente en este juego. Aparentemente un lider como Kane, el cual declaró la guerra a GDI, y fue participe de genocidios masivos, como hacer desaparecer casi toda europa con una bomba de tiberio liquido, de repente quiere aliarse contra sus peores enemigos con los cuales hizo guerras durante 80 años, para reparar el mundo (¿?) cuando él mismo quería que el planeta sea consumida por él....
Si no tiene sentido, está el guionista del juego, un tal Sam Bass, que se merece una patada en el trasero por esto. Supuestamente ESTE iba a ser el ULTIMO juego del universo de Tiberium... y así lo dejó.

 Que desastre... y otros se quejaban del final de Mass Effect 3...

Ok, con respecto al juego, que tenga el titulo de C&C no implica que se sienta como uno. Este juego es el intento de EA de hacer novedad en la franquicia, generando un MOBA, pero destruye lo que hizo clásico al C&C, poniendo limite de población, y sacando la construcción de bases, y NO HAY TIBERIUM (hay algun cristalito por allí en los mapas para mejorar poderes, pero no hay lo mas importante del juego!) por ende, no hay recolección de recursos. La idea es hacer un edificio móvil (Crawler) que permite la construcción de unidades de forma inmediata. Las conquistas de los mapas, se tratan de capturar diversos puntos estrategicos hasta que se alcance el limite de puntos, en multiplayer. Aunque llevado a la práctica, el juego es divertido y los mapas estan bien realizados a la par de que los combates no se detienen por nada, aquí no hay casi referencia a nada de command & conquer que lo hiciera famoso. Además para aquellos que se hayan comprado el juego, 1ero tienen que jugar la campaña para luego entrar al multiplayer, porque tiene un sistema de progresión de arsenal que se comparte tanto en single como en multi, por ende muchos se aprobechaban de esto y destrozaban a noobs por este tema. A pesar de esto, reconozco que el gameplay es bastante entretenido y divertido, pero se siente muy parecido a un Dawn of War 2, versión 2.1 en lugar de que se sienta como un C&C

Para aquel que sea casual, este juego le va a resultar interesante, porque su gameplay es frenético y las unidades son bien variadas, pero para el fan hardcore, sabiendo que este sería el final de 15 años de C&C, esto es un disparo a quemarropa al corazón (EA no piensa volver a este universo, solo utiliza un juego de Facebook horrendo en su lugar), así de simple ... al menos que seas capaz de dejar eso de lado y disfrutar el juego simplemente por lo que es y pensar de que  la historia de Kane pudo haber concluido mejor de lo que tristemente fue.","Back in 2012, I remember a Spanish cosplayer discussing the ending of Mass Effect 3 on her blog, and she thought it was unfair that it was such a disappointment. I responded, ""If that's the only thing that disappointed you about EA, it's because you haven't seen the ending of Command & Conquer 4. That's a real disappointment."" If you haven't played this game since then, I hope I've done you a favor by spending your time doing something more interesting, like staring at a wall, for example. xD

I'm telling you what I'm about to say from the perspective of a fan of the series. The franchise that made me a PC fan par excellence (long before Starcraft, Max Payne, KotOR, Medal of Honor, etc.) was, without a doubt, Command & Conquer (C&C), more or less the first instance for MS-DOS back in 1995. So I'm going to take a moment to explain the drama that plagues such a monster.

During the franchise's run, its former developer (Westwood Studios, which was acquired by EA in late 1999) had generated two timelines: the first based on the Cold War between the Western powers and the Soviet Union (USSR), and the second, on which C&C was originally based: The Universe of Tiberium.

To put it briefly: in the 90s, a meteorite with a green mineral called Tiberium falls in Eastern Europe, which begins to spread throughout the continent, consuming the Earth's resources and minerals. However, its lethality with any biotic entity with which it comes into contact is also consumed by the crystal, which poses a serious threat to global society. It is then that a secret society that worships the crystal, known as the Brotherhood of Nod, emerges from anonymity. It is led by a megalomaniac subject known as Kane (who considers himself the messiah, had preached the new era of tiberium for humanity, etc. He doesn't actually die in almost any game). The UN, to counteract this organization from assimilating the crystal for themselves, creates an international military division against terrorism known as the GDI or Global Defense Initiative. After this, three world wars erupt between these factions (which would be the basis of each Tiberium C&C) in which the death toll numbers in the millions, while tiberium nearly consumes the entire planet, destroying ecosystems and extinguishing humankind alongside armed conflicts.

And this is where the description of this game comes in. It takes place in 2062, almost 15 years after Tiberium Wars. The world is almost completely devastated by tiberium, and the extinction of the human species is almost imminent... but one day, Kane wakes up from his nap, listening to Joan Manuel Serrat singing ""Today Can Be a Great Day,"" and goes to pay a visit to the GDI executives and proposes a plan to save the world from the green crystal and for everyone to become hippies, thus saving humanity...

... does that make sense? Of course not. But anyway, sarcasm aside, this is what really happened in this game. Apparently, a leader like Kane, who declared war on GDI and participated in mass genocide, such as wiping out almost all of Europe with a liquid tiberium bomb, suddenly wants to ally himself against his worst enemies, with whom he waged wars for 80 years, to repair the world (?), when he himself wanted the planet to be consumed by him...
If that doesn't make sense, there's the game's scriptwriter, a certain Sam Bass, who deserves a kick in the ass for this. Supposedly, THIS was going to be the LAST game in the Tiberium universe... and he left it at that.

What a mess... and others were complaining about the ending of Mass Effect 3...

Okay, regarding the game, just because it's called C&C doesn't mean it feels like one. This game is EA's attempt to make the franchise unique by creating a MOBA, but it destroys what made C&C classic by imposing a population limit and removing base building. THERE IS NO TIBERIUM (there are some crystals around the maps to upgrade powers, but the most important part of the game is missing!), therefore, there is no resource gathering. The idea is to make a mobile building (Crawler) that allows the immediate construction of units. Conquering the maps involves capturing various strategic points until the point limit is reached, in multiplayer. Although in practice, the game is fun and the maps are well done, while the combats never stop for anything, there is almost no reference here to anything from Command & Conquer that made it famous. Also, for those who have already purchased the game, you first have to play the campaign before entering multiplayer, as it has an arsenal progression system that is shared in both single and multiplayer, so many took advantage of this and destroyed noobs for this reason. Despite this, I recognize that the gameplay is quite entertaining and fun, but it feels very similar to Dawn of War 2, version 2.1 instead of a C&C.

For the casual, this game will be interesting because its gameplay is frenetic and the units are quite varied. But for the hardcore fan, knowing that this would be the end of 15 years of C&C, this is a point-blank shot to the heart (EA isn't planning on returning to this universe, just using a horrendous Facebook game instead), simple as that... unless you're able to put that aside and enjoy the game simply for what it is and consider that Kane's story could have ended better than it sadly did."

13334005,german,2014.11.13 00:39,✅,✅,0.5,0,"also zuerst ja es ist kein c&c im eigentlichen sinn... nur finde ich die reviews nicht gerechtfertigt, klar 16h auf schwer ist jetzt nicht der hammer an zeit fürn singleplayer modus... 

zur Story, einfallslos und relativ sinnlos.. nämlich nod gegen nod, gdi gegen gdi und nod gegen gdi... ohne aliens

allerdings gameplay jetzt rein objektiv betrachtet (unabhängig von c&c) finde es einfach mal bißchen was neues und wenn man sich daran weng gewöhnt hat ists auch recht funny zu spielen.. auf lanpartys fehlt mir persönlich leider ein offline modus oder dedicated... aber gut mit bissl internet gehts auch...

Positives: 
-leicht zu erlernendes gameplay
-einfach gehaltenes leveling was anfängern den einstieg erlichtert
-zwischendrin nen netter zeitvertreib
Negatives:
-kein vergleich mit C&C (egal welcher teil)
-keine basis muss erbaut werden
-dumme ki","So first of all, yes, it's not C&C in the true sense of the word... I just don't think the reviews are justified. Sure, 16 hours on hard isn't exactly a lot of time for a single-player mode...

As for the story, it's unimaginative and relatively pointless... namely Nod vs. Nod, GDI vs. GDI, and Nod vs. GDI... without the aliens.

However, looking at the gameplay purely objectively (independent of C&C), I just think it's a bit new, and once you get used to it, it's quite fun to play. Personally, I miss an offline or dedicated mode at LAN parties... but it's fine with a bit of internet access...

Positives:
-Easy-to-learn gameplay
-Simple leveling, which makes it easier for beginners to get started
-A nice way to pass the time in between
Negatives:
-No comparison to C&C (no matter which game)
-No need to build a base
-Stupid AI"

Ок. Не подхожу. Игра - шлак. Игра в жанре, на секундочку, стратегии, в которой стратегия редуцирована до таскания краулера за войсками по полю боя, а тактика - к определению по принципу ""камень-ножницы-бумага"" нужного рода войск для текущей ситуации и накликиванию их необходимого количества в панели заказов.
Отстройка базы? Добыча ресурсов? Планирование развития? О чём вы - всего этого больше нет.

Что осталось на том же уровне - это сюжет и видеовставки. Первый логично завершает историю (хотя, сколько раз уже казалось, что она завершена), а вторые - традиционно отыгрывают это событие с выдающимся пафосом и мастерством актёра театра самодеятельности химкомбината. Разумеется, это нисколько ни умаляет игру, поскольку является её, своего рода, визитной карточкой. Умаляет её то, что чтобы получить ""тот самый"" сюжет на ""тех самых"" роликах приходится продираться через уже помянутый всуе чудовищный геймплей.

Что в итоге? В итоге ничего. Игры нет. Остался какой-то обрубок расчитанный на некую абстрактную ""новую аудиторию"", которая должна, внезапно, появиться в старом сеттинге. Что до меня - если бы была возможность сдать игру назад и получить назад свои деньги - сделал бы это незадумываясь. В конце концов, если бы я хотел поиграть спинным мозгом, запустил бы CoD, Crysis или FarCry.
","They tell us: We tried really hard. The game is great. Players just need to be open-minded about the new gameplay.

Okay. I don't qualify. The game is garbage. It's a strategy game, mind you, where strategy is reduced to dragging a crawler after troops across the battlefield, and tactics are reduced to determining the right type of troops for the current situation using the ""rock-paper-scissors"" principle and clicking the required number in the order panel.
Base construction? Resource extraction? Development planning? What are you talking about—all that's gone.

What remains is the same: the plot and cutscenes. The former logically concludes the story (though how many times has it seemed like it was over), while the latter, as usual, play out this event with outstanding pathos and the skill of an amateur theater actor at a chemical plant. Of course, this doesn't detract from the game in the least, as it's its calling card. What detracts from it is that to get ""that"" storyline in ""those"" cutscenes, you have to wade through the aforementioned monstrous gameplay.

The end result? There's nothing. There's no game. What's left is some stump designed for some abstract ""new audience"" that's supposed to suddenly appear in the same old setting. As for me, if I had the chance to return the game and get my money back, I'd do it in a heartbeat. After all, if I wanted to play with my brain, I'd fire up CoD, Crysis, or FarCry."

So as you can see, when I heard abotu C&C 4, I was prepared to enbark on a good bye party for my beloved franchise.

So why is the game bad? Well the first problem is the gameplay. The gameplay in terms of C&C gameplay felt like it was design by satan.

Now on to the downsides.

1. The complete lack of base building and resource gathering.  How you can even label this game as an RTS without these core elements is beyond me, instead of the staples of the RTS genre, units cost a certain amount of ""Command Points"" and that's it.  No tiberium, nothing to be gathered or collected or used tactically, just a limit placed on you at the start of the game and boom click a button, create units up to the limit and that's it, that's the extent of resources in the game.  And as for base building, much the same applies, you have a power limit so you place down a certain number of defensive turrets up to the limit and that's really all there is to it - on both fronts a complete lack of anything in-depth, evidence of a second rate game aimed at a minor market being shoe-horned into something much bigger than it actually is intended to be.

2. The units/maps/graphics.  The units provided at the start of the game are weak and ineffectual so in order to obtain more units you level up and then unlock them which sounds like a fairly simple concept, that is until you realise that exp. for leveling up is difficult to come by.  The lack of exp. becomes apparent after still not being awarded any after completion of the third mission in the story meaning that in order to progress your tech, hours of play time is required to unlock even just mostly mid-range units.  The weakness of initial units isn't alleviated by the fact that you can make large numbers as the Command Point limit applies so you are restricted to small squads of units, not the massive armies you expect from an RTS game.  To go with the theme of a small number of units, the maps which battles are conducted on are best summed up as tiny, cramped arenas with very little room for manouvere meaning it's goodbye to any tactical thinking and hello to comabt which feels scripted and unintelligent.  As if the unit/map situation was not already bad enough, this steaming mass of disappointment is served up in a graphical style more akin to a comic book setting, gone is the sleek, futuristic, powerful look of C&C3, it is instead replaced by  out of place, chunky, Megablocks style units, which completly destroys any sort of serious mood the game intends to create.  The graphical style of C&C4's units is so far removed from C&C3's that they're not even in the same universe, nevermind the same page.

3. The story.  It's fairly obvious that the story is terrible from pretty much the word go as one of the first scenes has you, as commander, greeted by your wife.  Yep, that's right, your wife because that's just what an RTS story needs, a bullshit love interest forced into the game.  From then on the story goes rapidly downhill, not aided by the dire acting of all those involved (with the exception of Joe Kucan) and then ends with the equivalent of ""And they all rode off into the sunset and lived happily ever after.""  Seriously? After having fought now at this time 4 Tiberium Wars, having battled across the globe and faced all manner of foes whilst still wondering about the mystery of Nod and Kane and what the ultimate goal could be, it ends with ""Kane and all of Nod travel through the alien tower and leave GDI behind on a tiberium-free Earth having left them peacefully"".  I have to wonder what it is with EA and their amazing ability to consistently screw up epic storylines and disappoint faithful fans of a beloved genre because that ending is just utter horseshit and reeks of a rushed writing crew being forced to pull something out of their asses.

So to conclude, C&C4 fails to deliver on all fronts: from dreadful mechanics and weak units, to poor acting and a storyline that could arugably have been concieved by a 5 year old, C&C4 smacks of poor quality, despiration and coporate greed.  A truly disappointing end to a great series, something that should not have come to pass.  I cannot urge you strongly enough, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!

Oh and one last thing... EA please if you would kindly go fuck yourselves bloody with a rusty sword that would be greatly appreiciated, you cunts.","It is not often that I am disappointed and depressed by a video game but unfortunately C&C4 has got to be one of the most awful games I have ever had the misfortune to have played.

So to conclude, C&C4 fails to deliver on all fronts: from dreadful mechanics and weak units, to poor acting and a storyline that could arugably have been concieved by a 5 year old, C&C4 smacks of poor quality, despiration and coporate greed.  A truly disappointing end to a great series, something that should not have come to pass.  I cannot urge you strongly enough, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!

Oh and one last thing... EA please if you would kindly go fuck yourselves bloody with a rusty sword that would be greatly appreiciated, you cunts."

Lustigerweise sieht man während des Sales nur positve Wertungen...EA ist ein echter Dreckskonzern geworden der seine Franchises melkt ohne Ende.

Sowohl Menüführung als auch Ingamesteuerung sind sehr gewöhnungsbedürftig, eher unübersichtlich(ich hab zuviele RTS gespielt als das ich mit Steuerungen nicht zurecht käme)

Both the menu navigation and the in-game controls take some getting used to, rather confusing (I've played too many RTS games to be able to handle the controls).
The experience system is pretending to be innovative and poorly explained due to the lack of a top-down structure (better known as talent trees, because there aren't any).
Plus, the graphics look like they're from a console port, a la PS2 (Ultra-high graphics would have been acceptable if it had been 2006).
It feels like it was rushed to market.

Selbst C&C Renegade was total den Vorgängern entsprechend als FPS released wurde war noch 1000 mal besser als dieser Teil der C&C Serie. Wer hier auf einen Classiker der C&C Reihe, wie man es kennt, hofft, irrt sich hier leider in jeder hinsicht. Vergleicht man dies zu den ""alten"" Teilen (Ja ich weiß allles war früher besser etc. etc. pp.) ist dies der größte Griff ins Klo den ich je von C&C erlebt habe.

Nur als Info für euch ich fand C&C bis zum heutigen Tage eines der (für meinen Geschmack) BESTEN RTS Games die es gab.
Seit heute werde ich wahrscheinlich jeden weiteren C&C Teil meiden.

Klare NICHT-Kauf Empfehlung. Auch nicht im Sale/SuperSale und als Geschenk wäre es von euren Freunden eher ein Gack weil diese zu viel Geld haben um euch ein bisschen zu necken.

Liebe Grüße

Ein enttäuschter G4rd1u5","So, if you've known C&C since the first installment, it's a SUPER strategy game with a good story... at least up until this installment. Even C&C Renegade, which was released as an FPS, completely in keeping with its predecessors, was 1000 times better than this installment in the C&C series. Anyone hoping for a classic of the C&C series as we know it is sadly mistaken in every respect. Compared to the ""old"" installments (yes, I know everything was better back then, etc., etc.), this is the biggest flop I've ever experienced with C&C.

Just to let you know, I found C&C to be one of the (in my opinion) BEST RTS games ever.
From now on, I'll probably avoid every future C&C installment.

A clear NO-BUY recommendation. Not even during the sale/super sale, and as a gift, it would be more of a gimmick from your friends because they have too much money to tease you a little.

Best regards

A disappointed G4rd1u5"

The only things I liked were the ability to level up and the more or less solid campaign. The skirmish mode killed me with its tedious nature of capturing towers and racking up points; it gets old really quickly. Maybe I'm just not a fan of these types of games, but I really prefer something more like the older C&C games. The graphics aren't particularly impressive either.

11095255,english,2014.06.06 07:44,❌,✅,0.5,1,"I have so many mixed emotions about this game.

One of my biggest beefs with this game is that it's just plain short.  There are only 7 GDI missions,  7 NOD missions, and 3 common missions.  I finished it all in 14 hours.  Not much room in there for story.  The story they did have, and the cutscenes, seem very low budget and thrown together.  No Hollywood actors this time around.  The final cutscene in each campaign is literally the actors standing in front of a white sheet with a drawn picture.  If they had doubled the number of missions, I would be recommending this game.  It seems like they're trying to bring a lot of focus onto multiplayer, but I'm only interested in the single player aspect.

One thing that took a little while to get used to is that they changed the gameplay style.  Previous C&C games have had the formula of building/defending/expanding a base, managing your economy and power, and trying to push out as many units as you can.  In this game, you have a fixed number of points that can be redeemed for units, another set of points for structures, and third set for skill upgrades and expanding your tech tree.  There are no power plants, harvesters, etc.  And if a unit is killed or a structure is lost, you get your points refunded, and can build it again.  A key strategy is to continually move your MCV forward, towards the goal.  This makes most of the maps very linear.  Once you can get past the dramatic difference in play style, the game actually gets enjoyable.  Though some of the time, it just feels like you're filling up your build queue so you can spam the enemy.

With the new all-in-one MCV style, they added something that I thought was not well executed.  Instead of just one kind of MCV, they now have three:  offensive, defensive, and support.  Offensive is mostly for making units.  Defensive is for setting up structures like cannons and bunkers.  Support was totally useless to me, as it's for making repairs and setting up airstrikes.  The reason why this wasn't well executed is that you could only have one MCV at a time.  So you can't be defending a structure and attacking the enemy's MCV at the same time.","I have so many mixed emotions about this game.

Farlo in una saga così importante e nel suo capitolo conclusivo, inoltre, non è stata la scelta vincente.
Togliere completamente la gestione della costruzione della base ed eliminare la raccolta delle risorse in favore di un maggior dinamismo, poteva essere un buon punto di partenza, ma visto il risultato troppo approssimativo, questo quarto capitolo farà storcere il naso anche ai fan meno incalliti.
In Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight l'attenzione del giocatore non è più rivolta verso la fortificazione di un luogo sicuro da cui far partire i propri attacchi, ma viene diretta verso la gestione di poche unità e di una base mobile andando così a cambiare radicalmente il modo di giocare rispetto al passato.
Il fatto di non doversi più preoccupare di perdere la propria base principale ha portato pesanti modifiche anche nel sistema del gioco online lasciando così spazio a modalità più vicine alla freneticità degli sparatutto piuttosto che agli strategici, portando così il giocatore a lanciarsi negli scontri con il proprio arsenale spianato, anziché a ragionare e attendere il momento giusto per evitare di vanificare i preziosi momenti passati ad accumulare risorse e soldati come avveniva in passato.
Per fortuna non tutto è andato perduto; i video di intermezzo mantengono il carisma che da sempre caratterizza la saga del tiberium e la storia vi stupirà con diversi colpi di scena.
Interessante anche il fatto di poter giocare la campagna in modalità cooperativa nonostante questa sia di scarsa durata. Discorso a sé per il multiplayer che a causa dei livelli di esperienza e di alcune combinazioni di unità aeree dei GDI inarrestabili, si rivela un’esperienza online troppo sbilanciata.
In conclusione questo era un prodotto con le potenzialità per divenire un must, se solo si fosse limitato a essere Command & Conquer e non un titolo che ne mantiene solo il nome sulla copertina ma che ne modifica profondamente lo stile di gioco, non ottenendo i risultati desiderati","Revamping a game almost always brings benefits, but also many risks.
Doing so in such an important saga and in its final chapter, moreover, wasn't the right choice.
Removing base construction management and resource gathering entirely in favor of greater dynamism could have been a good starting point, but given the rather sketchy result, this fourth installment will turn off even the most die-hard fans.
In Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight, the player's focus is no longer on fortifying a safe location from which to launch attacks, but instead on managing a few units and a mobile base, radically changing the gameplay compared to the past.
No longer having to worry about losing your main base has led to significant changes to the online gameplay system, making way for modes more akin to the frenetic pace of shooters rather than strategy games. This forces players to dive into battle with their arsenal at the ready, rather than thinking and waiting for the right moment to avoid squandering precious time spent accumulating resources and soldiers, as was the case in the past.
Fortunately, not all is lost; the cutscenes retain the charisma that has always characterized the Tiberium saga, and the story will surprise you with several twists.
Also interesting is the ability to play the campaign in cooperative mode, despite its short duration. Multiplayer is a different story, as due to the experience levels and some combinations of unstoppable GDI air units, it proves to be an unbalanced online experience.
In conclusion, this was a product with the potential to become a must-have, if only it had limited itself to being Command & Conquer and not a title that only keeps the name on the cover but profoundly changes the gameplay style, not achieving the desired results."

命令与征服4首先最不能容忍的就是将延续下来的，以资源转化为单位的传统RTS即时战略改成了以指挥点数为资源的即时战术游戏，——命令与征服作为RTS鼻祖之一最后落得必须更改为即时战术游戏，作为游戏标志的泰伯伦矿居然变成了升级用道具，难怪公布时玩家会大喊“还我大片大片可以收割的泰伯伦矿！”一款没有泰伯伦的命令与征服，这简直就是对命令与征服系列的亵渎。

至于游戏的在线模式完全就是在和同期的星海争霸2的模仿，仿效SC2一样采用与网络平台合体，强制联机的方式，将游戏的单机内容完全捆绑在在线模式之上，可是万万没想到的是，命令与征服4没有提供离线单机体验模式，很多人想打剧情，就只能连接上连线质量并不怎么好的EA服务器。并且还得注册一个EA账号（即后来origin账户），

另一方面，可能是对命令与征服3系列忽视命令与征服2的风格的一点“补偿”，本作矫枉过正的打造了一个满屏太空服士兵和机甲的战斗场面，但是这些机甲与命令与征服2的风格完全不搭界，三种机甲主基地的外观被斥之为“春卷”和“乌龟盖”，可以说明显就是画虎不成反类犬的一个体现。

至于剧情，在将Westwood硕果仅存的几个成员干掉之后，新的编剧Samuel Bass大展自己胡编乱造的能力，将原有“泰伯伦黄昏”的剧本完全无视，秉承着迫不及待将剧本写死的态度写出了一个漏洞百出的大结局，并且十分幼稚的秉承”只要把GDI写坏，把NOD洗白就好”的简单思维，把原本GDI虽代表正义但是内部腐化，NOD表面邪恶却拥有宗教一般的反派魅力的两种风格给彻底的黑白分明化，并且将其安插在一个犹如肥皂剧一般的剧本中，最终肯恩更是莫名其妙的离开地球了。

至此可以看出，这个剧本，就是为了判命令与征服本传系列死刑而写的，他自始至终就传达着一个意思：C&C——DIE！

在EA LA饱受摧残之后，命令与征服4成为了LA改组前的遗作，刚刚度过红色警报3的磨合期，整个命令与征服系列的标签从Westwood到EA LA，第二代CNC的风格崛起这一系列蒸蒸日上的迹象之后，EA LA又因为命令与征服4步了Westwood的后尘，于是我们看到了一个不伦不类的命令与征服4，以及其代表的真正的“泰伯伦黄昏”——属于命令与征服的黄昏。","If Command & Conquer 3 was a harbinger of the Command & Conquer series' resurgence, then Command & Conquer 4 was EA putting the series on the gallows, eager to hang it immediately, and then pulling out the corpse for people to mourn (or perhaps curse)—yes, Command & Conquer 4 is just such a ""heap"" of ruined corpses.

The most intolerable thing about Command & Conquer 4 is that it changes the traditional real-time strategy game, which converts resources into units, into a real-time tactical game, where command points are the resources. Command & Conquer, one of the original RTS games, ultimately had to be changed into a real-time tactical game. The game's iconic Tiberium ore was even turned into an upgrade item. No wonder when it was announced, players cried out, ""Give me back the vast expanses of Tiberium to harvest!"" A Command & Conquer without Tiberium is a sheer blasphemy against the Command & Conquer series.

As for the game's online mode, it's a stark imitation of StarCraft 2, a contemporary game. Like StarCraft 2, it integrates with online platforms and enforces online play, completely tying the game's single-player content to the online mode. However, Command & Conquer 4 surprisingly lacks an offline single-player experience. Many who want to play the story are forced to connect to EA servers with subpar connection quality. This requires registering an EA account (later known as an Origin account).

On the other hand, perhaps as a way to ""compensate"" for the series' neglect of the style of Command & Conquer 2, this game goes overboard with a battle scene filled with spacesuit soldiers and mechs. However, these mechs bear no resemblance to the style of Command & Conquer 2. The appearance of the three mech main bases has been criticized as ""spring rolls"" and ""turtle shells,"" a clear example of a case of trying to achieve the wrong result.

As for the plot, after eliminating Westwood's few remaining members, new screenwriter Samuel Bass unleashed his uncanny ability to fabricate stories. He completely disregarded the original ""Tiberium Twilight"" script and, in his eagerness to finish the story, crafted a flawed finale. He also naively followed the simplistic ""just make GDI look bad and NOD look good"" mentality. He completely skewered the two villainous characters of GDI (who represented justice but was internally corrupt) and NOD (who appeared evil but possessed a religious-like allure) and placed them in a soap opera-like scenario. Finally, Kane inexplicably departed Earth.

It's clear that this script was written to sentence the original Command & Conquer series to death. Its message from beginning to end is: C&C—DIE!

After EA LA suffered a lot of damage, Command & Conquer 4 became the last work before LA's reorganization. Just after the running-in period of Red Alert 3, the label of the entire Command & Conquer series was transferred from Westwood to EA LA, and the second-generation CNC style rose. After this series of signs of prosperity, EA LA followed in Westwood's footsteps with Command & Conquer 4, so we saw a weird Command & Conquer 4 and the real ""Tiberium Twilight"" it represented - the twilight of Command & Conquer."

This game shows a fantastic idea, a fantastic concept, something that could have worked out great - IF IT DIDN'T HAVE THE LABEL AS A FULL ON SEQUEL TO THE TIBERIUM UNIVERSE C&C GAMES. As a spinoff, this game would have been mediocre, but as the official sequel and ending to the C&C storyline, this game is abysmal in every way possible.

Not a single thing feels C&C about this game - theres a tiny population cap, there's no base building, there's no resource collection, maps are small, the campaign is abysmal with a terrible storyline and cutscenes that don't just look bad - they are legitimately stuff someone likely recorded with their iphone camera and slapped into the game! Just watch any sections that involve the ""public"" speaking rather than paid actors. The only saving grace in the storyline is Joe Kucan, who as always takes the role of Kane and makes an extremely badass villain until a terrible ending that's the same regardless of which faction you go with - AN ENDING THAT'S THE SAME REGARDLESS OF WHICH FACTION YOU GO WITH. Let that sink in.

The progression system is terrible - yes, there's a progression system. This game revolves around collecting tiberium crystals INDIVIDUALLY and using them to upgrade your MCV to higher tiers to unlock better units and such. However, when you start, you are level 1 and have access to absolutely NOTHING. Only after you level up several times will you unlock the 2nd tier of technology which at first is completely worthless without a single thing used for it. Everything has to be unlocked through progression and this BLATANTLY makes anyone who's a higher level than you stronger than you with no workarounds based on how good of a player you are or anything, PERIOD. For example, you have to pick a class - offensive, defensive, or support. If you go defensive, at the beginning of the progression scale you only have access to 3 infantry units. No vehicles of any sort, period. While these infantry units CAN be used to counter other infantry, vehicles, or aircraft, they're all infantry and can be MUCH MORE EASILY COUNTERED by a diverse enemy army.

This is a game that again, has a fantastic concept that was soiled by something that clearly had the goal of being made with the least amount of funding possible, the least motivation possible, and the smallest amount of time necessary to produce it - probably so EA wouldn't have to pay people to work on this game any longer than they would have to before it was BARELY functional as a game and could be pushed out the door, which is exactly what they did.

And what sucks is, if everyone is maximum level on progression, the multiplayer can actually potentially be fun. It feels like the game was designed for that, but it was just unfinished, so to pad the length of the game and make people play it longer, they slapped progression in to make you grind to be level 20 (the cap).

Do not buy this game. If you want a good C&C game from recent times, go with Red Alert 3. Just don't expect any multiplayer options since this is the ONLY C&C GAME to not run on Gamespy and the gamespy servers are going to tank here in a month.","I tried really hard to like this game, as it's the final C&C game that it looks like we're getting in a long time - could even be the last the way EA is heading with their BS. This game shows a fantastic idea, a fantastic concept, something that could have worked out great - IF IT DIDN'T HAVE THE LABEL AS A FULL ON SEQUEL TO THE TIBERIUM UNIVERSE C&C GAMES. As a spinoff, this game would have been mediocre, but as the official sequel and ending to the C&C storyline, this game is abysmal in every way possible.

Not a single thing feels C&C about this game - theres a tiny population cap, there's no base building, there's no resource collection, maps are small, the campaign is abysmal with a terrible storyline and cutscenes that don't just look bad - they are legitimately stuff someone likely recorded with their iphone camera and slapped into the game! Just watch any sections that involve the ""public"" speaking rather than paid actors. The only saving grace in the storyline is Joe Kucan, who as always takes the role of Kane and makes an extremely badass villain until a terrible ending that's the same regardless of which faction you go with - AN ENDING THAT'S THE SAME REGARDLESS OF WHICH FACTION YOU GO WITH. Let that sink in.

The progression system is terrible - yes, there's a progression system. This game revolves around collecting tiberium crystals INDIVIDUALLY and using them to upgrade your MCV to higher tiers to unlock better units and such. However, when you start, you are level 1 and have access to absolutely NOTHING. Only after you level up several times will you unlock the 2nd tier of technology which at first is completely worthless without a single thing used for it. Everything has to be unlocked through progression and this BLATANTLY makes anyone who's a higher level than you stronger than you with no workarounds based on how good of a player you are or anything, PERIOD. For example, you have to pick a class - offensive, defensive, or support. If you go defensive, at the beginning of the progression scale you only have access to 3 infantry units. No vehicles of any sort, period. While these infantry units CAN be used to counter other infantry, vehicles, or aircraft, they're all infantry and can be MUCH MORE EASILY COUNTERED by a diverse enemy army.

This is a game that again, has a fantastic concept that was soiled by something that clearly had the goal of being made with the least amount of funding possible, the least motivation possible, and the smallest amount of time necessary to produce it - probably so EA wouldn't have to pay people to work on this game any longer than they would have to before it was BARELY functional as a game and could be pushed out the door, which is exactly what they did.

"
9542245,german,2014.02.18 20:08,✅,✅,0.6526136994,106,"Eins vorweg: Ich spiele C&C seit 1995, habe jeden Teil mehrfach durchgespielt, auch auf den höchsten Schwierigkeitsstufen und diverse Online und Lan Matches hinter mir. Kenne mich dementsprechend mit der Materie aus.

Kurzfassung

Ja, man kann das Spiel, wenn man es wie ich im Angebot kauft durchweg spielen, sollte es jedoch NICHT zu C&C zählen, dann macht das Spiel durchaus Spaß, auf wenn man egal mit welchem Crawler, einer mobilen Einheit die ähnlich der mobilen Waffenfabrik von Tiberian Sun ist, man eigentlich nur vor die gegnerische Basis fährt und den Gegner mit Einheiten totwirft.

Langfassung

Kampagne: Neben dem, schnellen und recht lustigen Multiplayer ist die Kampagne ja das eigentliche Augenmerk, leider wurde hier viel verändert. Der Spielcharakter ist mal wieder namenlos, hat diesmal eine Ehefrau in den Cutscenes die ebenfalls nicht mehr die Klasse anderer Teile erreichen. Die Charaktere sind, zumindest für mich unbekannt, flach, überspitzt kitschig und mit für mich unbekannten Schauspielern besetzt. Storyline mehr als flach, aber ich will hier nicht spoilern.

Grafik

Ungefähr auf höhe von Tiberium Wars, somit immer noch die Generäle Engine, die trotzdem irgendwie ""eckig"" wirkt in sachen Einheitenbewegung und Crawlerplatzierung, ähnlich Alarmstufe Rot 3.

Sound

Durchaus okay, bekannte Sprecher, EVA von der gleichen Person gesprochen wie in Tiberium Wars. Leider fehlt knackiges Geschützfeuer.

In eigener Sache

Leider wurde mal wieder einiges geändert, abgesehen vom Crawlersystem. C&C 4 sollte eigentlich ein Onlinespiel nur für den Asiatischen Raum sein und somit Starcraft ebenbürtig werden. Die Kampagne kam erst im nachhinein, das erklärt viele Logiklücken. Die typischen C&C Waffen wurden durch realistische wie z.B. P90 in Cutscenes geändert, die Hintergründe sind nur blinkende Computerwände, ähnlich Carters Versuchslabor bei Stargate SG1. Die GDI Uniformen wurden ebenfalls gegen realistische Uniformen getauscht. Zwar haben beide Seiten wieder SciFi Einheiten wie man es in der Zukunft auch erwartet, doch komsicherweise haben alle Leute scheinbar einen totalblackout, da scheinbar keiner mehr weiß das Schallwaffen Tiberiumkristalle zerstören. Die Liste geht noch um einige Punkte weiter, aber ich denke man versteht was ich sagen will.

Fazit

Nettes Skirmish/Multiplayerspiel, mit Online und EA Registrierungszwang, aber 0 Storyline. Ironischerweise sind die Entwickler teilweise jünger als ich selbst, vielleicht liegt bei der u20 Generation die akzeptanz für Action statt Story höher.

7,5 von 10 Punkten","First of all: I've been playing C&C since 1995, have completed every installment multiple times, even on the highest difficulty levels, and have played various online and LAN matches. Accordingly, I'm quite familiar with the subject matter.

Short version

Yes, you can play the game all the way through if you buy it on sale like I did. However, if you don't consider it C&C, then the game is definitely fun, especially if you use any crawler, a mobile unit similar to Tiberian Sun's mobile weapons factory, and all you do is drive to the enemy base and blast the enemy with units.

Long version

Campaign: Besides the fast and quite fun multiplayer, the campaign is the real focus, but unfortunately, a lot has been changed. The player character is once again nameless, and this time he has a wife in the cutscenes, which also don't reach the quality of other installments. The characters are, at least not familiar to me, shallow, exaggeratedly cheesy, and filled with actors I don't know. The storyline is more than shallow, but I don't want to spoil it here.

Graphics

Roughly on par with Tiberium Wars, so it still uses the Generals Engine, which nevertheless feels somewhat ""angular"" in terms of unit movement and crawler placement, similar to Red Alert 3.

Sound

Quite okay, familiar voice actors, EVA voiced by the same person as in Tiberium Wars. Unfortunately, crisp gunfire is missing.

On a personal note

Unfortunately, a lot has been changed again, apart from the crawler system. C&C 4 was originally supposed to be an online game only for the Asian region and thus on par with Starcraft. The campaign came later, which explains many of the logical gaps. The typical C&C weapons were replaced with realistic ones, such as the P90, in cutscenes; the backgrounds are just flashing computer walls, similar to Carter's test lab in Stargate SG1. The GDI uniforms were also replaced with realistic ones. While both sides have sci-fi units again, as one would expect in the future, strangely enough, everyone seems to have a complete blackout, as no one seems to remember that sonic weapons destroy Tiberium crystals. The list goes on for a few more points, but I think you get the point.

Conclusion

Nice skirmish/multiplayer game, with online and EA registration required, but zero storyline. Ironically, some of the developers are younger than me; perhaps the under-20 generation is more likely to accept action than story.

Absolutely the worst C&C game ever made, without a doubt, I don't know how EA could make C&C 3 so incredibly amazing and then do a couplete U-turn and make this. This may well be the worst game I have ever had the misfortune to play. I paid under £5 for this and it was still too much. I feel like EA should be paying us to play this.
The ""always-online"" that EA has a big hard-on for lately is a nightmare.
The only reason I bought this was to concluce the CnC tiberium storyline and even that was terrible. Did you know there's no more tiberium in this game? Literally, it's pretty much all gone. No base building, no harvesting resources. You can train units without any cost but only up to a very, very limited unit cap. I'm talking REAL limited. Like you can only train enough units to have a decent attack force or a decent defense force. Not both. I expect that kind of limit on a console RTs but not PC.

Es is praktisch schlechtes ""DOTA"" für das C&C Universum ... viel Geklicke, gar kein Effekt.

Mit dem Genre""Echtzeit-Strategiespiel"" hat es sicher nix mehr zu tun. Schon gar nicht mit dem Stil des Genres, den die Reihe ursprünglich geschaffen hat.

Fakt ist, man kann sein MBF am besten gleich neben dem Gegner MBF parken ... denn wer das Lotto der Units besser mischt, zerstört das MBF ... aber man kann ja ein neues holen.

Unterm Strich heißt das:
- Taktik-Frei
- Resourcen-Frei
- Chaos pur

It certainly has nothing to do with the ""real-time strategy game"" genre anymore. And certainly not with the style of the genre the series originally created.

How it feels: With luck, you can produce roughly what you need. Usually, two-thirds on one theme, the rest ""mixed up randomly."" You'll never have more than 20 units, so a little of each, and a little something to attack the enemy's ""base.""

The fact is, it's best to park your MBF right next to the enemy MBF... because whoever shuffles the unit lotto better will destroy the MBF... but you can always get a new one.

The bottom line is:
- Tactics-free
- Resource-free
- Pure chaos

The campaign is a very brief set of 17 missions, 3 tutorial and 7 each for GDI/Nod. The story is on par with a cheesy Sci-fi Channel movie and is largely the same for both factions. Gameplay's not terrible once you get used to it, but it's pretty boring.  The main challenge is the incredibly small unit cap which in turn leads to an incredibly small army. This is exacerbated by the bonus units found on most maps which are counted in the cap and can put you over the cap.

Honestly i don't understand why this game got such bad reviews. At no point are you ever forced into multiplayer, like one of the previous reviews said. I've been playing the campaigns and did a few skirmish maps with the AI to level my profile. Which does lead into one partial negative. That being the near necessity of playing one of the campaigns before you start skirmish modes. Apperently the unlocks are tied to yoru profile rank which is persistant in the campaign and skirmish. 

Game play's not really that aweful as some have described. It's more of a elite squad based kind of strategy take on C&C. That may be off putting to some, but you do have a ""base building"" option with the defense crawler. Just don't expect massive bases like in C&C3. I did find myself useing the offensive crawlers a little bit more than i would have liked.

So the story lines a little anti climactic. Sadly given that it's the end of the series, it would have been near impossible to have actually finished it properly for the majority of the fan base. So i can't fault it for that, though i do find fault in how the cutscenes follow through. It's like there are parts missing.

И необязательно умрёт с добавлением резких, кардинально новых деталей в процессе естественной эволюции серии в новой части. Но Франшиза всегда умирает, когда теряет свои корни и основы.
В C&C4 франшиза умерла с лёгкой подачи своего издателя - EA. Потому что в компании кто-то решил, что для бизнеса будет гораздо лучше, если новая часть будет совсем другой. В итоге мы получили следующее. Все базовые и незыблемые основы геймплея C&C спилены накорню, сюжет убог, обрезан и лишён смысловой нагрузки (И харизма Джо ""Кейна"" Кукана в этот раз не спасает). Вместо классических баз - три вида разбалансированных штаба, выбор между которыми всегда очевиден. Отсутствие классической экономики и ресурсов, скучные и лишённые тактики сражения. Роль Тибериума здесь -  отвечать за прокачку бесполезных и ограниченных в своей механике скиллов. И всё это безусловно печалит...
В игру не хочется играть, игровой мир не хочется изучать.  Приходится заставлять себя проходить сюжетку ради финальных роликов. А если играть приходится через силу - то что же это за игра? Где удовольствие?
","How can you painfully ""kill"" a franchise? A franchise doesn't necessarily die with the closure of the original developer's studio. And it doesn't necessarily die with the addition of drastic, radically new elements during the natural evolution of the series in a new installment. But a franchise always dies when it loses its roots and foundations.
In C&C4, the franchise died at the behest of its publisher, EA. Because someone at the company decided it would be much better for business if the new game was completely different. The result is this. All the basic and unshakable foundations of C&C gameplay were completely erased, the story is pathetic, truncated, and devoid of meaning (and Joe ""Kane"" Kukan's charisma doesn't save it this time). Instead of classic bases, there are three types of unbalanced headquarters, the choice between which is always obvious. The absence of a classic economy and resources, boring and tactically devoid battles. Tiberium's role here is to boost useless skills that are mechanically limited. And all of this is undoubtedly sad...
I don't want to play the game, I don't want to explore the world. I have to force myself to play through the story just for the final cutscenes. And if I have to force myself to play, what kind of game is it? Where's the fun?"

Теперь об игре:
- Сюжет в этой игре рассказывает всю тайну о Кейне, разговоры в этой игре какие то вялые и скучные;
- Теперь базу не нужно строить вообще, теперь появились 3 краулера: Наступательный, Оборонительный и Поддержка. Это хорошая затей-ка разработчиков сделать игру поинтересней;
- Ещё в игре появилась прокачка Братства Нод и Глобального Совета Безопасности, максимальный уровень 20;
- На каждом уровне открывается, что-то новое, например: какие-нибудь новые войска, постройки или какое-нибудь улучшение;
- Хорошая сетевая игра, которая включает различные режимы, множество карт, короче она вас затянет на долго. Но игра требует постоянного подключения к Интернету, отсутствие которого приведет к потере продвижения.
 Вывод: я думаю, эта часть получилась не такой уж интересной, чем другие. Но всё же стоит отметить, что  в эту игру стоит поиграть.
Выходя из всего этого, ставлю той игре оценку 7 из 10.","Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight is the final installment in the Command & Conquer series. And so, everyone's favorite Kane retires.

Now about the game:
- The story in this game reveals the entire secret about Kane; the conversations in this game are somewhat weak and boring;
- You no longer need to build a base at all; there are now three crawlers: Offensive, Defensive, and Support. This is a good idea by the developers to make the game more interesting;
- The game also features leveling for the Brotherhood of Nod and the Global Security Council, with a maximum level of 20;
- Each level unlocks something new, such as new troops, buildings, or upgrades;
- A good online game with various modes and a variety of maps will keep you engaged for a long time. However, the game requires a constant internet connection; a disconnect will result in lost progress.

Conclusion: I think this game wasn't as interesting as the others. But it's still worth noting that this game is worth playing.
Based on all this, I give it a 7 out of 10."

In some misguided attempt by what I can only assume is an ill-informed marketing department somewhere deep in the bowels of the EA mega structure this installment of the Command & Conquer franchise changes everything about the previous games. They even went so far as to remove the live action cut-scenes that, despite being where B-movie stars go to die, had become a benchmark in the industry.

You no longer build bases or harvest Tiberium, instead you get allocated a number of points that can be spent on units, when a unit die you get your points back and can try a new combination. It takes what used to be a very balanced RTS experience and turns it into an entirely micromanagement experience, and not a terribly good one at that.

This is not unlike what you might see in the later Dawn of War games but where Dawn of War balanced it with RPG elements making each unit seem important here you are just sending mindless, faceless entities towards a bunch of other mindless, faceless entities in the hope of beating the map objective before you mind rots from the monotone boredom.

Command & Conquer might be viewed by many as the classic simple RTS, but it was the one that monopolized the best on that approach and it was the franchise that more than any other made the real time strategy genre a force to be reckoned with.

Now it is nothing more a boring mediocre clone of a game, trying to do with all the other cool new RTS's are doing but not doing it nearly as well and losing what made the game special in the first place in the attempt.

It is a sad end for what was once such a proud franchise. The older Command & Conquer games will forever hold a special place in my heart but this makes me hope the series will die before another abomination is released.","Command and Conquer what happened to you. You used to be the king of RTS. Your cheesy live action cut-scenes were the stuff of legend and we eagerly anticipate your every release.
Now what have you done to yourself? No resources, no armies, no bases? What is this? A shadow of what used to be?
YOU ARE NOT COMPANY OF HEROES!
Why can't you stay the way you used to be? We all loved you and cherished every memory of you? Why do you have to cheapen what we have?
Why? WHY? WHY?!

This game reeks of a rush job, as if EA was hurriedly seeking to close out and move from the CNC franchise. To call it underwhelming and disappointing is an understatement. Stay away unless you really feel compelled to complete your CNC collection.

GAMEPLAY
In one word: boring.

Harsh limits on the number of units you can control makes this feel like a tactical game, with none of the visceral satisfaction often seen in those games. The game is heavily based on counters/hard counters, but even in disparate matchups by this system, the  encounters take forever to finish.

Combine this with how easy it is to replace lost units, and missions quickly become a slog.

The singleplayer is a total dud in all aspects. Missions are linear and short, and there aren't many of them. The cutscenes show a similar lack of dedication, being completely forgettable and doing little to actually wrap up the Tiberium universe story.

The multiplayer was occasionally entertaining, but given that is rarely the reason I play an RTS, it was immaterial for me.

GRAPHICS/AUDIO
Technically speaking, they aren't bad. However, the cartoony visuals are at odds with the rest of the Tib universe (including CNC3), and unit designs are both bland and uninspired. Much of the same can be said about the audio.

Long story short? Never, ever play C&C4:TT. It's more awkward than discussing religion at the workplace and rarely ends with such a quippy anecdote."

This is much more about fewer stronger units, than base and army building. That considered, the game modes given offer a challenge and it is neat to work to unlock units.

The single player portion of the game has a some what corny story that manages to be legitimate and includes with it some live action cinematics, with familiar characters, that are of similar quality. I would say though its a great effort and you are not there for the cinematics any way so it's easily forgiven. 

Overal its an alright game but multilayer is not for the casual gamer unless it's among friends.","This game is alright if you do not judge it but the game play found in the older games.
