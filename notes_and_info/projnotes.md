Interesting notes: 

- Games in the Positive and Negative sections rarely had 50+ reviews total. Often they were rated 100% pos/neg but simply didn't have the numbers total to boost it up higher in the ratings. (Clearly the review being noted as positive or negative alone isn't the only factor considered when giving a game its overall score)


Game selection criteria:
- Single-player games (primarily)
- older than 1 or 2 years (where possible)
- Not AAA studios (filtered roughly by selecting by price)
- Price range <$40 (not worried about minimum price but >$10 ideal)
- Has at least 1000 number of reviews (where possible)
- Game in English, only considering English reviews
- Full games only (no DLC), sequels OK
- No limitations on genre or game play style, single player only main limit
- only select games that the overall review ranking and the english review ranking are the same


Current coding/data hurdles to think about:
- how to iteratively rename cols of dfs when one will be different for each df


Other notes:
I've already started the cleanup workflow using the deathloop data but I'm probably going to ultimately exclude it from the project because of its price point ($60)

Steam store search was limited to $50 max and games only (no software, DLC, soundtracks etc) to a total of 48,121 results. No content filters applied (for adult content or anything like that)

Here's a chart that shows the way games are ranked - sentiment and review count both matter (image saved)

Next steps/thoughts:

Worth doing a base analysis on before jumping into the classifier?
