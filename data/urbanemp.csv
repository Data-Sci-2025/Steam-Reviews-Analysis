203448313,german,2025.08.03 19:06,❌,❌,0.5,0,"Ich konnte mich gar nicht mehr daran erinnern, dieses Spiel mal gespielt zu haben, tat ich aber offensichtlich.
Nun nach mehr als insgesamt 14h Spielzeit (davon nach über 8 Jahren) heute wieder ca. 2h, bin ich zu der Überzeugung gelangt, dass dieses Spiel auf absolut verlorenen Posten steht.
Zum Glück weiß ich nicht mehr, was ich für diesen Titel bezahlt habe, im aktuellen Zustand würde ich jedoch sagen, mehr als 6 Euro wäre er mir nicht wert! Autsch!

Zum Spiel an sich:
Es lockt mit zahlreichen Elementen die ich von anderen Spielen mag, das Bausystem ist nicht perfekt aber ähnelt einem SimCity oder ähnlichen Titeln. Hinzu kommt der politsche Aspekt, man muss ständig Entscheidungen treffen und abwägen.

Leider gestalltet sich das Bauen, wozu dieses Spiel eigentlich einläd als sehr schwierig ohne Trainer etc.
Ohne würde ich bei diesem Spiel wahrscheinlich schon nach 10min die Flinte ins Korn werfen denn,
es ist quasie unmöglich irgend was zu bewegen, sei es neue Distrikte erstellen, bestehende beartbeiten oder was auch immer. Ständig hast du die Wahl, mit deinem Privatvermögen IG (was du ohne Cheats quasie nicht hast) oder durch Votings deiner Ratsmitglieder der unterschiedlichen Partein zu dem zu kommen, was du eigentlich willst. Sie stimmen meist gegen den geplanten Schritt und somit beläuft es sich dabei, dass man Stunde um Stunde auf das immer gleich bleibdende Stadtbild starrt, da man ohne Zustimmung nichts machen kann. 

Schade eigentlich, auch ein Freebuild mode oder eine Funktion, bei der man sich selbst die Start und Zielbedingungen des Spiels setzen kann fehlt leider komplett. Die Kampangen und Szenarios sind freundlich gesprochen frustrierend.
Eine Schande ein derartiges Spiel in meiner Bibliothek zu haben!
Es hat sich nach über 8 Jahren so gut wie nichts am eigentlichen Spiel getan.

Guckt euch lieber Katzenvideos auf YT oder so an, da habt ihr mehr von!",

This is a good game, I just wish they'd put a bit more of time and love into it. Talking about love, I can only ask you to try and give this game some love because it's really deserving if you like the genre.

Urban Empire is a unique blend of city-builder and political simulator, and while it’s far from perfect, it definitely stands out in its own way.

[b]Let’s start with the good stuff:[/b]

- The voice acting is actually really nice and adds personality to the game.
- There's a surprising amount of depth to city management, with real consequences for bad decisions, which I appreciate.
- The political system, though not flawless, forces you to think strategically and negotiate with parties to push your agenda—at least until you're rich enough for it to stop mattering, except maybe during mayoral elections, where you do can get voted out otherwise.
- I love the era progression—both aesthetically and mechanically. Decisions like replacing gas grids with electricity city-wide actually feel impactful.
- District management is richer than you'd expect. You can add features like phone service without placing phone booths, or upgrade roads without traffic lights. It's cool, though admittedly shallow in execution and not as smooth as it could be, making upkeep hard to manage and progress difficult. I think that's the big reason why many people bounce off the game.

[b]Now, the not-so-good:[/b]

- The game badly needs a better tutorial. Key mechanics like traffic, happiness x taxes, and political goodwill are barely explained.
- I had no idea there were different victory types until I checked the achievements—this is never explained.
- Upkeep is brutal in the early game. Not expanding usually means going into the red, forcing you to grow faster than you might want, messing with compact city planning, so much that you can't really take advatange of public service ranges.
- Performance sucks in the late game, especially in Era V.
- Endorsing is shallow.
- The character backstories and roleplay options feel hollow. Even playing as a conservative family doesn't change the fact that social reforms (like rights for women/LGBT/children) are always beneficial, so you’re never incentivized to roleplay against them.
- The zoning demand system is kind of broken when you have a lot of districts. High demand doesn’t always lead to logical expansions, which can cause stagnation.
- The game could really use some fresh mechanics introduced in later eras—something like Twin Cities or Party Spying. It would make era progression feel more meaningful and dynamic.

Despite all this, there's a solid, very ambitious game underneath. It just needed a bit more polish, explanation, and some optimization love.

If you're into political strategy and want a city-builder that tries something different, give Urban Empire a shot. It might surprise you—as long as you’re willing to forgive its rough edges.","[b]7/10 – Good[/b]

Ja, das Spiel wirkt an manchen Stellen noch unsauber und es gibt gar manchen Gamebreaking Bug. Im Grundsatz ist das Spielkonzept aber durchaus innovativ, komplex und bei Erfolgen sehr befriedigend (aber mit Arbeit versehen, Datenbanken analysieren, Stellschrauben minimal anpassen, Risiken eingehen oder wieder Rückzieher machen). Mir fällt auch kein anderes Spiel ein, welches eine recht realistische Städtebausimulation mit den Vorgängen von Parteienpolitik schlüssig verbindet. Da ich beruflich selber Stadtplaner bin, kann ich bestätigen, dass der Städtebau-Teil akkurat (wenn natürlich auch vereinfacht) abgebildet wird. 

Präsentation, Gameplay, UI etc. erinnern dabei etwas an die ""goldene"" Zeit vergleichbarer Simulationen in den 90er und 2000er Jahren. Insbesondere die Grafik haut natürlich niemanden um. Ich halte es aber für zweckmäßig und authentisch.","I can't understand the extremely negative response. Yes, the game still seems sloppy in some places, and there are even a few game-breaking bugs. Fundamentally, however, the game concept is quite innovative, complex, and very satisfying when you succeed (but it requires work: analyzing databases, adjusting parameters slightly, taking risks, or backing out). I can't think of any other game that coherently combines a fairly realistic city-building simulation with the workings of party politics. As a city planner myself, I can confirm that the city-building part is portrayed accurately (albeit simplified).

The presentation, gameplay, UI, etc., are somewhat reminiscent of the ""golden"" era of comparable simulations in the 90s and 2000s. Of course, the graphics in particular won't blow anyone away. But I consider it functional and authentic."

Because of all the bad reviews which again I do think raise valid points I only dared get it on a big discount because I was very curious to try it out. And after just a couple playthroughs I do think the game has a very interesting and enjoyable concept, it could have been a great game really if it was just a little bit better balanced. Unfortunately the game is simply too punishing. You have to raise money in order to build improvements to keep the population happy to keep them productive and raise more money. It's a simple loop and it is actually quite enjoyable and interesting in the beginning, the game throws you different situations and options to make each playthrough a little different. The problem is that the upkeep of the improvements quickly becomes too expensive to maintain. So what you do is you raise taxes. Council will not let you raise taxes too high however (and it's a good thing they don't let you because it would choke your economy, the council is actually pretty smart and most of the time following along with it rather than opposing it too strongly is a good strategy). If you start defying council too much it will lose you political goodwill with the different parties... and then you risk getting voted out and game over. So it's very easy to get stuck in little depressions and recession downward spirals and then you're not progressing and you have to spend a full era just rebuilding your economy to start progressing again and what should have been fun and rewarding instead becomes agonizing and frustrating. So do expect to get disappointed if you get it and just enjoy the bittersweet taste of what could have been a great game.","I do think there is fun to be had playing the game and that is why I recommend it but I also agree that there are lots of problems with it.

First some positives: The UI is really beautiful (although difficult to navigate) and everything looks pretty great overall until you try to move the camera around.

Sadly, it falls a little short. The game runs fitfully, and I'm not using a potato. Camera operations are annoying and limited in a way that affects gameplay sometimes. There isn't a lot of explanation or exposition, which makes it hard to learn things.

I just really like the political element, where you have to politic with the various factions to get votes.  That's very realistic.

The learning curve is definitely steep, and it is easy to push forward with a lot of what a player might believe are 'good to have' governmental/city/social changes, policies and funding bills that can quickly eat up your budget and put you into a death spiral towards bankruptcy; thus it is critical to pace yourself, and even more critical is to not push hard with all the factions on every bill that comes before you and the council.  If you do that, you will ultimately alienate the council and when it comes time that you REALLY do need their help, they won't be responsive.  saying, ""you owe me one, you owe me one, you owe me one"", will result in, ""no, we don't, we already helped you again and again and again, go away"". 

Instead, just like in real life, you must pick and choose which bills are important and critical to get passed by the council, and either delay or ignore the others.

There are other players that have gone in to detail on how to successfully manage city growth & budget, so I won't dive into that.  

Finally, It is important to keep in mind that you are managing a city in a lesser developed country.  It is not imperative that every district in your town have all the most modern amenities.  If some parts of town do not have a natural gas grid, or still use cobblestone or dirt roads, but installing such infrastructure will wreck your budget going forward, then don't do it.  For example, I live in the heart of downtown Atlanta; i recently learned that 100 years ago (1920's), all the streets north of my building were unpaved dirt roads.  Electricity was installed in the area in the 1940's and the first streetlights were installed in late 1950s!  Your budget must be constrained by what your tax base can support, not what looks pretty.  

Self restraint is the hardest aspect of the game.  Modernizing your city and implementing social equality must be paced against what the people demand vs what is 'nice to have'.  Master that and you will find the game a rewarding experience.

Easily my favorite political/city management game, hands down.  If you're looking for Urban Planner games, play Cities Skylines.

Dos simuladores de cidade, este é o único que me faz sentir um presidente de câmara.  Este jogo é sobretudo um simulador político.  O jpgador nada constroi sem o avalio da assembleia,  contituida por partidos políticos. A mestria do jogador não está em construir grandes infraestruturas. Está sim em equilibrar os partidos por forma a que votem as alterações e construções que propõe,  positivamente. 
Basicamente  o jogador propõe a construção de distritos, a sua constituição residencial, comercial e industrial. A partir daí todas as inovações, construções, no fundo a melhoria de vida das classes sociais; são propostas pelo jogador e votadas em assembleia. Só então, sendo aprovadas pelos partidos em votação, serão executadas.
Existe uma árvore tecnológica baseada em 5 eras, que vai desbloquear tecnologias, construções e decretos. Os decretos são igualmente aprovados em assembleia e influenciam tal como os serviços construídos, a felicidade da população.

W każdej normalnej grze gracz budując coś rozwija miasto, zarabia coraz więcej i tak dalej. Nie tu. Tu postawienie czegokolwiek zawsze skutkuje stratami. Zresztą jak nic nie robisz to i tak twoje dochody lecą na łeb na szyję. Bo tak. I oczywiście gra ci nie powie dlaczego przedsiębiorstwa w mieście upadają. Na co ci to. Wynalazłeś coś? Super. Właśnie pogorszyłeś sytuację zamiast ją poprawić. Do tego gra bezczelnie wprowadza w błąd. Jest napisane, że coś ""wspomaga przedsiębiorstwa"" tyle że nie. Nie widać jakiegokolwiek efektu poza zwiększeniem wydatków. Albo napisane jest że zwiększa popyt o... -5%. Czyli zmniejsza popyt? O co tu chodzi? Dlaczego ekonomia w tej grze jest tak spieprzona? No i rada miasta. Jej decyzje są często bardzo dziwne. Tracisz co miesiąc pieniądze, ale i tak ci nie pozwolą zwiększyć podatków bo przecież wciąż są pieniądze w kasie miejskiej. A nawet jak skarbiec pęka w szwach, wszyscy w mieście cię kochają to i tak będą głosować przeciwko tobie w wyborach... Ech... Ja tego po prostu nie pojmuję. Albo idzie dobrze i jest w miarę fajnie, albo bez żadnego powodu gra stawia cię w sytuacji bez wyjścia. Co nie zrobisz (albo nie zrobisz) to i tak będzie tylko gorzej. A najgorsze, że nie wiadomo dlaczego. I gapi się człowiek w monitor nic nie mogąc zrobić, bo albo kasy brak, albo rada przeciwna, albo nagle kryzys gospodarczy czy coś. Grać się odechciewa. Nie polecam.","The game has a cool theme with the city council, family, and events related to it... and that's the only positive thing about it. In any normal game, the player develops the city by building something, earning more and more, and so on. Not here. Here, building anything always results in losses. Besides, if you do nothing, your income plummets anyway. Because it does. And of course, the game won't tell you why businesses in the city are failing. What good is it to you? Did you invent something? Great. You just made the situation worse instead of better. On top of that, the game is blatantly misleading. It says something ""supports businesses,"" but it doesn't. You don't see any effect other than increased spending. Or it says it increases demand by... -5%. So it decreases demand? What's going on? Why is the economy in this game so screwed up? And then there's the city council. Their decisions are often very strange. You lose money every month, but they won't let you increase taxes anyway because there's still money in the city coffers. And even if the treasury is bursting at the seams and everyone in town loves you, they'll still vote against you in the elections... Sigh... I just don't get it. Either things are going well and it's all good, or for no reason at all, the game puts you in a hopeless situation. Whatever you do (or don't do), it'll only get worse. And the worst part is, you don't know why. And you're left staring at the monitor, unable to do anything because either there's no money, the council is against you, or there's a sudden economic crisis or something.

Zakupiłem tą grę tylko dlatego iż w empiku na promocji za 2 zł wyłapałem. I po roku dopiero odpaliłem. Nie jest to jakaś wyśmienita gra, wyśmienity tytuł. Grafika i muzyka jest dobra a gameplay przyjemny. Czasem się zdarzy jakiś błąd (jak dla przykładu nie naliczą się punkty głosowania i nie ma kilku podstawowych opcji które by ułatwiły grę (np. podczas budowania dzielnic nie można cofnąć poprzedniej akcji i często musiałem 20 razy wyłączać i włączać opcje bo coś źle zrobiłem). Na początku się wydaje że wszystko jest losowe w radzie miasta (na co wiele osób narzeka) a nie jest to prawdą. Sam tak myślałem przez pierwsze 4 godziny gry po czym się zorientowałem że dużo czynników ma znaczenie podczas przemów do partii. 
Uważam tą gierke za dosyć przyjemny tytuł do zakupienia na jakiejś promocji po taniości (cena 100zł jest strasznie przesadzona, i jeżeli bym kupił tą grę za 100zł to też bym się na nią zirytował) i do pogrania gdy portfel jest pusty i nie ma w co grać.
Mocne 7/10

Pozdrawiam",

Das Tutorial ist sehr knapp gehalten, wodurch man mehrere Anläufe braucht, um die Spielmechanik richtig zu verstehen. Aber auch dann kann eine Fehlentscheidung das Ende der Karriere bedeuten, wodurch es nicht langweilig wird. Obwohl ich schon 40h gespielt habe, sind mir Feinheiten immer noch nicht bewusst, also wie ich gezielt einzelne Gruppen wie die Mittelschicht oder Elite zufriedenstelle und die Unterschicht eher aus meiner Stadt raushalte. Obwohl die Übersetzung ins Deutsche gut gelungen ist, ist die Voransicht vieler Ereignisse undurchsichtig. Man bekommt mit Symbolen angezeigt was die Auswirkungen der Entscheidung in welchem Bereich sein sollen, allerdings kann man die Symbole nur schwer zuordnen.
Größtes Manko ist die fehlende Optimierung des Spiels im Endgame. Vermutlich bräuchte man einen NASA Computer um das Spiel gegen Ende ruckelfrei zu spielen. Änderungen der Grafikeinstellungen auf praktisch null mit Reduzierung der Auflösung (Alt+Enter um wieder Vollbild zu haben) bringen eine Besserung der Performance. Das Problem ist wohl bekannt, aber es gibt keine Lösung. Dadurch werden die letzten 40 Jahre im Spiel sehr anstrengend. Anstatt seine aufblühende Stadt zu betrachten und sich über die Kleinigkeiten in der Umgebung zu freuen, ruckelt entweder alles vor sich hin oder man muss sich mit niedrigsten Einstellungen und nur noch wenigen Rucklern begnügen.
Trotzdem ein spaßiges Spiel. Ein zweiter Teil der alles noch mal optimiert und neue Inhalte hinzufügt oder Inhalte besser verzahnt, könnte ein Top-Seller Titel werden.",

La reseña es muy negativa porque está en inglés, pero el juego está muy chulo, lo de votar cada decisión que quieras tomar en tu ciudad es una mecánica que nunca había visto y que está muy lograda.

Vale que está en inglés pero para cualquiera que sepa una base de ingles y buscando 4 palabras que no entiendas, se puede jugar perfectamente. Si tu nivel de inglés es medio, juegas perfectamente, además si has jugado a otros citybuilders, la parte de construir la ciudad, los servicio, etc, es como en todos, marcas una zona con los distritos y se construye sola. 

En fin, a mi me ha gustado y francamente no veo la necesidad de hacer un master en inglés para jugarlo, solo un poquito de voluntad y un pelin del traductor de google.

No te lo recomendaría en dos casos:

1.- Que no sepas nada de inglés, porque vas a estar más traduciendo que jugando.

2.- Que tus ganas de traducir un poco, sean nulas.","There are few games whose reviews you can't trust... but this one, in my opinion, is seriously underrated. The review is very negative because it's in English, but the game is very cool. Voting on each decision you make in your city is a mechanic I'd never seen before, and it's very well done.

Okay, it's in English, but for anyone who knows a basic level of English and can search for four words you don't understand, it's perfectly playable. If your English level is intermediate, you'll play perfectly. Also, if you've played other city builders, the city-building, services, etc., part is like all the others: you mark an area with the districts, and it builds itself.

Anyway, I liked it, and frankly, I don't see the need for a master's degree in English to play it. You just need a little willpower and a bit of Google Translate.

I wouldn't recommend it in two cases:

1. If you don't know any English, because you'll be translating more than playing.

2.- That your desire to translate a little is null."

Le jeu offre une simulation d'urbanisme et de politique dans une ville visiblement législativement indépendante, mais malgré tout à l'intérieur de l'Empire d'Autriche et de sa juridiction ( ou un truc du genre ).

Bref, niveau city builder, c'est très vide. Il suffit de selectionner une zone et le quartier prendra forme dedans de lui même, et des fois, c'pas très logique le résultat. On est pas sur city skyline..
Ensuite, une fois tout les quartiers posés (j'le fais en début de partie histoire d'être tranquille), il y a uniquement les services à positionner au fur et à mesure de la partie. Ensuite, place à la gestion, ce qui devrait être top, est enfaîte complétement chaotique. Les lois, le budget, les taxe, les décrets, tout doit être fait via un Conseil Municipal. Même si l'idée est bonne, c'est répétitif et loin d'être dynamique. Les partis sont très flou, s'attirer leur sympathie est très aléatoire.

Le plus grand problème du jeu, c'est de ne savoir aucune conséquence possible de nos choix. On rajoute le gaz dans ce quartier ? On va connaître le cout, mais pas les bénéfices apportés au quartier.. Pour pouvoir financer votre ville, les taxes doivent être en continuelle augmentation, du coup mes industries payent 70% de taxe mais tout va bien.

Ernsthaft, lässt euch von den krassen Rot um mich herum nicht das Spiel madig reden.

Ja, technisch ist es nur mittelmäßig, aber das ist für mich okay. Ich erwarte ja auch kein AAA Titel von einem kleinen Studio, das in einem ganz anderen Genre aktiv ist. Wer danach sucht, soll zu den großen Studios gehen oder Batterien kaufen. Verstehste? Wegen AAA. Fand ich lustig.

Die Erwartungshaltung ist das Problem. Wer hier einen fetten Titel erwartet, wird maßlos enttäuscht werden. Wer sich aber darauf einlässt, hinter die Mechaniken zu schauen, wird interessante Intentionen der Entwickler finden. Auch wenn viele Funktionen im Spiel nicht gut genug gebalanced wurden, will doch jede Funktion eine Aussage treffen. Beispielsweise stört mich der Zufallsgenerator für Ereignisse und Reaktionen auch, aber überlegt Mal: In der Politik ist es auch oft Glück, ob deine Aktion eine positive Reaktion bekommt. Es ist nicht alles von dir abhängig in der Welt. Genauso die fehlenden Informationen. Du bist kein Gott, sondern ein popeliger Typ im Anzug. Bis vor wenigen Jahren war es normal, dass die Regierung eigentlich keine Ahnung hat, wie die exakten Daten zu einem Thema aussehen, weil es gar keine Möglichkeiten gab, diesd Daten zu erheben. Gute Politiker definierten sich durch ihre Expertise, auch ohne genaue Daten handlungsfähig zu sein. Genau das wird von dir abverlangt. Willkommen im Präimformationszeitalter.

Ich kann verstehen, wenn jemand die ganze Mittelmäßigkeit als spielstötend empfindet. Wenn du ein wirklich spiegelglattes Gameplay brauchst, ist es nicht dein Spiel. Ich verbinde mit diesem Spiel aber den Anfang von meinem Philosophiestudium. Vor allem die ersten Zeitalter haben mich umgehauen vom Setting. Wir leben selbstverständlich in heutigen Denkmustern und dieses Spiel forderte mich in meinem Denken auf allen Ebenen heraus. Und das hat mir sehr gut gefallen.

Deswegen reite ich mit meinem Pferd am Bahnhof vorbei und denke: Züge werden sich niemals durchsetzen.",

首先来说有优点吧， 游戏的城市建设有点像凯撒大帝，并加入了科技树，最主要是有中文，这么繁多的信息如果没有中文基本我是不会买的。，美工和音乐方面还可以。
游戏有一些独特的地方，但是我还是给到差评
政治管理和城市建设结合是非常新颖的。但是制作组很久就停更了，很多需要优化的东西都没有完善。 例如进入第三个时期后，游戏就开始卡，即便你的电脑运算能力优秀， 再进入第四个时期基本上是点一下顿三秒， 体验极差。游戏本身是大作价格，圈完钱跑路真的让人很失望。
房屋模型就那么几样，以至于没有兴趣去观察城市的面貌。
市政建筑维护，还有公共系统的升级太贵，以至于你可能玩到现代了，还在用煤油灯。随便一个升级都让你直接破产Game over。赚钱最快的办法就是开新区，偏偏这个政治系统开区还要拉票，如果你负债了拉票基本不会过， 所以游戏只要一负债就基本结束了。

La stratégie est virtuellement inexistante. Vous attendez d'être dans un gros déficit pendant un mois, et là vous proposer la plus hausse d'impôt de l'histoire humaine. Après quoi, vous êtes tranquille jusqu'à la fin du jeu.
Pour les cartes, n'en avoir que 3 est une vraie insulte, surtout vu leur taille. Il est facile de placer tous les quartiers nécessaires dès la première ère (sur 5 ères) et d'ensuite seulement améliorer les quartiers, voire les réaménager pour gérer le ratio résidentiel/commercial/industriel.
Quatre dynasties c'est bien, mais comme on finit par faire voter les mêmes lois pour les mêmes raisons ça semble très inutile.

Sinon, c'est un city-builder très orienté gestion financière, et c'est très sympa. Mais au bout de 4-5 parties, vous aurez a sensation d'avoir vraiment fait le tour de la question. Les conditions de victoire sont les seules véritables difficultés du jeu, difficulté parfois issue du fait que le jeu n'est pas toujours transparent dans ses mécaniques.

All in all this is quite a good game if you understand what it is. So be warned: this game is not a typical citybuilding game and it's not that intuitive either.

This aspect of having to deal with opposition and how the different districts interact can sometimes feel like a bother. It might slow down the pace for you but you'll have to consider when you play your political cards or you become a tyrant in the opinion of your councel, and eventually end up stuck with no cooperation whatsoever and  having ""nothing to do but watch everything fall apart"". Of course you'll hate this game then. The political and economical aspect however does make this game a lot more realistic than traditional citybuilders. Having said that you do still have partial freedom to spend your own income however you want. You might want to save your own funds for emergencies though because for the whole of the rest of the counsel you'll have to make sense somehow with the layout of your city and find the compromizes, for example to collect the taxes needed to survive the next economic crisis or boom, all set in a sandbox historical timeframe.

1: O jogo NÃO é um City Builder, e sim algo próximo de administração política-monetária.
Se você está pensando em comprar esse jogo com Cities Skylines como modelo base, eu recomendo que não o compre, agora se você procura um jogo de articulação política com um bom grau de história REAL embutida, ai sim esse jogo vira uma boa escolha.
2: A administração da cidade é sim um aspecto importante do jogo, porém não é o foco da jogatina.
3: Se você é o tipo de pessoa que gosta de criar uma cidade com as políticas que você considera ideais, você pode passar um pouco de dificuldade, o jogo reconhece toda e qualquer política como algo possivelmente otimista e viável, e frequentemente um partido vai propor algo que você talvez não concorde. Se a dificuldade e a raiva de que suas propostas talvez não passem não forem um importuno, sim eu recomendo esse jogo.
Resumo: Urban Empire é um jogo de administração POLÍTICA, você NÃO tem muita liberdade na forma em que a cidade e seus distritos são criados, a política do jogo tem um foco muito bom e é bem realista, cada partido com suas ideologias e você frequentemente vai ter que desafiar um para agradar o outro, escolha entre 4 casas nobres, cada uma com o seu estilo de jogo, embora todas acabem levando para o mesmo lugar, mudando apenas algumas mecânicas baseadas na ideologia de cada casa.

Pensando na proposta do jogo e como ele a executa:
Nota na área da POLÍTICA: 8.5
Nota na área da CIDADE(Construção): 6.0
Nota na HISTÓRIA (Real): 10
Nota na HISTÓRIA (fictícia do jogo): 7.0
Nota geral: 8.0
é um bom jogo para aqueles que preferem a política.

 일단 남들이 말하는데로 단점이 넘치는 게임이다. 튜토리얼도 부실하고 제대로 된 경제시스템이나 시티빌딩적 요소가 반영되지 않는다. 팁을 주자면 그냥 세금 투표 쿨타임마다 올려서 7~80프로 맞추고 구역지으면서 건물이랑 기관 지어주면 도시 완성된거다. 어차피 각종 세금 풀로 올려도 그래서 고용이 줄어든다던가 소비가 줄어든다던가 그런거 없다. 있다해도 안느껴짐. 특히 기반시설은 효과는 거의 없는 수준인데 유지비는 유저 뺨싸다구 왕복으로 후려갈기는 수준이라 그냥 안 짓는게 낫다. 그냥 흑자인데 심심하다 싶으면 가끔 올려주면 됨. 

 그리고 호의가 계속되면 둘리인줄 안다는 교훈을 주기위해 정당에게 호의를 쓰면 관계가 점점 개박살나니 호의는 들고만 있고 중요할 때나 쓰자. 기술연구하다보면 중간에 무조건 도입하는 선택지가 뜨는데 위에 커서 올려두면 색으로 정당들 반응 볼 수 있으니까 뜨는 옵션 중에 반대걸릴 거 같은걸 도입하면 됨. 어차피 반대에 가 있으면 있는 호의 전부 꼬라박아야 중립쯤 오고 이후에 관계도 개판나니 별로 중요하지 않은 투표면 쿨하게 포기하는게 낫다. 그리고 표차이x10만큼은 쌓아둔 지위로 밀어붙이기가 가능하니 호의 남발하지말고 재선하는데 쓸만큼은 남겨두자. 

 2판 정도까지는 캐릭바꿔가며 이벤트 보면서 무난하게 즐길만 한 것 같다. 인내심 깊은 사람이면 3판까지도 즐길 수 있을거고 그럼 20시간 정도는 되니 본전뽑고도 훨씬 남는다. 그 이상은 컨텐츠 부족도 있지만 최적화 문제 때문에 어지간히 취향아니면 하기 힘들 것이다. 노답급 발적화라 최고사양으로 돌리는데도 4~5번째 시대가 되면 슬슬 렉걸리고 특히 저장이랑 불러오기가 속터지게 느리다. 딱 5천원 가치정도 하는 듯. 큰 기대없이 그 정도되는 게임이라고 생각하고 하면 적당하게 플레이 가능.",

I did try to like the game. But is rather un-innovative.
You create a district, which is a combination of 3 zones like in SimCity (industrial, economical and housing). You can divide it by %, but by default it's 60% housing, 10% econ and the rest industrial.
You can, like in other games, add buildings to service the needs, eventually upgrade the districts and it's density etc.

The main thing about the game - political choices. Basically to do most of the things, you need to convince the ever increasing ammount of parties. They listen to you when you use convience options, like pleads or threats.

Only - there doesn't really matter which you use.
And secondly - as long as you have money and don't want to pull a bill that will put you in the red too much, they will agree to most things.

Even further - getting services for your districts will ruin you. So you just cash in on them and only get the ones that boost industry.
Than once you have enough cash, you just build another district. Rinse and repeat.

REPEAT is the key word in the game. While you do upgrade researches, most of the things seem rather passive, with other upgrades beeing simply too expensive to be viable at all. Electricity should in theory make your rich right? But in practice it doesn't translate that way.
But brushing that aside (you eventually can afford the stuff later if for whatever reason you want it), nothing ever changes.
The city doesn't feel alive at all. Everything is a made up stat with no consequence. Only cash generation matters. You don't do anything almost.

There is only voting. Which is even more repetetive! All you do is move the parties on a slider, with same options every time...

It begins rather ok-ish, but the more you play the game, the more tired you become and less rewarding it gets.

During the campaign the main character changes to it's progeny, but that happens from era to era, changing your portrait and few passives... There are some scripted bills that reflect on the changes in history, like child labour, women's rights, etc. and they seem to be scripted - on first go everyone just opposes them and you have little change to win, later no matter what everyone simply has a change of hearth and supports it... It's entirely pointless and only exists for flavour, giving you the illusion of having some part in it.

Muszę przyznać że jest to jedena z tych pozycji które są ciężkie do oceny, a po wielu godzinach gry wywołuje w nas mieszane uczucia – z jednej strony dobre, lecz z drugiej strony posiadający szereg niedociągnięć które nie działają motywująco by zachęcić nas do dalszej gry. 

[i]Mała Dygresja:[/i]

Wychowałem się na grach Sim City, więc nie przejdę obojętnie obok gry z kategorii city builder bez wcześniejszej przyjemności spędzenia z nią kilku(nastu) godzin, rozkoszując się możliwością budowy wymarzonego miasta – bez względu jak źle oceniana jest przez wszystkich.


[h1]Ale do rzeczy:[/h1]

Tak jak wspomniałem na początku gra Urban Empire to bardzo ciekawy tytuł, który posiada dobre strony, duży potencjał na dobrą grę, jak i te które działają w sposób negatywny – a jest ich trochę i będę chciał poniżej je opisać by osoba zainteresowana tym tytułem, dobrze wiedziała co ją czeka.

[b]Naszą przygodę rozpoczynamy[/b] z miejsca wyborem rodziny która będzie zarządzać naszym miastem przez całą grę (od 1820r) – każda z rodzin jest inna, posiada inną „własną” historię, jak również statystyki początkowe (bonusy / złe strony) jakie otrzymujemy na początku gry, które maja realny wpływ na postrzeganie nas w społeczeństwie. Z upływem czasu, jak również decyzji jakie podejmiemy w samej grze, statystyki będą ulegać zmianie, czy na lepsze czy gorsze – to wszystko zależy od was samych i prowadzonej przez was polityki lokalnej.


[h1]Dalej…[/h1]

[b]Budowa miasta[/b] jest na pozór prosta, aczkolwiek wszystko budujemy w ramach projektu dzielnic. Na tej podstawie będziemy mogli zarządzać, dodawać bądź ulepszać infrastrukturę naszego miasta, urozmaicając i ułatwiając życie naszym mieszkańcom. Co ciekawe z upływającym czasem społeczeństwo będzie się zmieniać i będziemy tego naocznymi świadkami.

[b]Polityczny element[/b], aspekt w tym tytule jest mocno zauważalny, na nim głównie skupia się cała gra – reszta elementów jak budowa miasta, czy odkrywanie technologii szybko wędruję na drugi plan to jest zauważalne i odczuwalne.

Prowadzenie polityki niestety nie należy do prostych rzeczy w tym tytule, gdyż każda z lokalnych frakcji zarządzających miastem będzie miała ustalone własne cele, priorytety jak by chciała by / w jaki sposób nasze miasto się rozwijało. Nie zawsze musi się to pokrywać z naszym planem działania, więc będziemy musieli zdobywać w „przeróżny” sposób aprobatę / poparcie tych innych frakcji.

Tu zaczyna być ciekawie, gdyż poparcie w głosowaniu nad danym projektem, prawem, rozporządzeniem u innych frakcji możemy uzyskać przez dialog, dyskredytacje innych frakcji, łapówkę, szantaż (zdobywamy potajemnie informacje), wsparcie projektu innej frakcji itp. działania – mamy czym dysponować by nasz projekt przeszedł w radzie miasta.

Jednakże nie zawsze nasze działania przyniosą oczekiwany rezultat, a wręcz przeciwne działanie od zamierzonego – pod tym względem trzeba być mocno elastycznym. 

Projekt który podniesie jakość życia naszych mieszkańców nie zawsze będzie przychylnie brany pod uwagę innej frakcji którzy w tym czasie skupili się na innych rzeczach – a z biegiem czasu nastawienie, relacje jak i mentalność frakcji będzie ulegał zmianie.

[b]Technologia[/b] to kolejny ważny element tej gry, który bazuje na realnych światowych odkryciach, w tym współczesnych, coś na kształt tego co możemy spotkać w grze Civilization – to bardzo ciekawy pomysł i dobrze pasuje do tej produkcji. Nadmienię ponownie że grę rozpoczynamy w roku 1820, tak więc odkrywanie (opracowywanie) nowych technologii i późniejsze wprowadzanie ich do naszych dzielnic (miasta) będzie miało realny wpływ na każdy aspekt społeczeństwa, nowe budynki a co za tym idzie wszechstronny balans zysków i strat, nowe prawa, regulacje miejskie, obawy społeczeństwa i frakcji w jakim stopniu będziemy stosować daną technologię – [b]będziemy decydować o tym przy każdej technologii, czy wykorzystamy to dla dobra rozwoju społecznego czy militarnych zapędów itp.[/b]

Z biegiem czasu nasze społeczeństwo będzie się zmieniać, nasza infrastruktura, mentalność naszych obywateli, innych frakcji rządzących również, nowelizacje / usuwanie rozporządzeń będących nieadekwatnych do obecnych czasów, będą powstawać nowe współczesne problemy, dylematy, które będą się regularnie pojawiać w grze, a naszym zadaniem będzie reagowanie na tego typu sytuacje. Nie będziecie się nudzić pod tym względem to wam gwarantuje.

[b]Grafika jak i audio[/b], nie powala w tej grze, jest OK -  nie spodziewajcie się tu super jakości bo niestety gra skupiła się na innych elementach. Jednakże nie stanowi to kluczowy problem, taki jak poniższe.

[h1]A teraz od drugiej strony…[/h1]

[b]Optymalizacja gry[/b], biorąc pod uwagę że gra nie posiada super grafiki wysokiej rozdzielczości to gra nawet na mocnym sprzęcie potrafi czasem przyciąć, chodzić wolno co jest dziwne.

[b]Każde działanie w grze będziemy rozstrzygali poprzez głosowanie w radzie miasta[/b], budowa potrzebnych, wręcz wymaganej przez społeczeństwo infrastruktury będzie brane pod głosowanie – i w większości przypadków to przeprawa przez piekło. Jeżeli frakcje w radzie miejskiej mają jakieś „dąsy” do Nas to budowa szpitala, bądź nowej dzielnicy może zostać wstrzymana (odrzucona).

[b]Zarabianie pieniędzy[/b], a dokładniej minimalne możliwości na zarabianie to jeden z problemów w tej grze, gospodarka praktycznie nie istnieje, brak możliwości wyspecjalizowania miasta w taki sposób by eksportować dobra na świat, zarabiając przy tym pieniądze – bazuje się głownie na minimalnych przychodach, a biorąc pod uwagę szybki upływ czasu to nie nadążamy za rozwojem do współczesnych wymogów społeczeństwa.

[b]Ulepszenia[/b], w grze ulepszenia w obszarze dzielnic można wprowadzać stosunkowo łatwo, jednakże usunięcie zbędnej infrastruktury / ulepszenia nie jest już czymś prostym, a przestarzała (nie wykorzystywana) infrastruktura np. gazociągi, nie można odciąć, usunąć. Co zmusza nas do dwóch rzeczy, stale płacić za utrzymanie gazociągu bądź skasowanie całej dzielnicy – co jest wkurzające. 

[b]Upływ czasu[/b], jak nadmieniłem powyżej jest stanowczo za szybki, co uniemożliwia zrównoważony rozwój względem technologicznych możliwości i oczekiwaniem społeczności co do wprowadzanych / zmiany miejskich rozporządzeń, rozwoju infrastruktury. 

[h1]Podsumowanie:[/h1]

Urban Empire to ciekawy tytuł, posiadający duży potencjał na dobrą grę, jednakże całościowo generuje mieszane uczucia. Z jednej strony przedstawia dobre połączenie symulatora budowy miasta, symulatora politycznego jak i rozwoju technologicznego rodem z Civilization.

Z drugiej strony występuję w niej wiele podstawowych uchybień które zmieniają radość z tego co robimy, w późniejszą ciężką przeprawę i batalię – co nie koniecznie może się spodobać każdemu. Co sprawia że gra nie należy do najprostszych.
 
Plusem jest to że gra jest obecnie tania (edycja pudełkowa), więc jeżeli chcielibyście przetestować własne siły w Urban Empire, to za niewielkie pieniądze możecie pograć w naprawdę ciekawy tytuł.

Ja oceniłbym tą grę do pikantnej potrawy, niby pali was że macie po pewnym czasie tego dosyć, jednakże na kolejny dzień chcecie jeszcze raz spróbować.

48459412,german,2019.00.21 16:02,✅,❌,0.6416937709,10,"Das Spiel ist bei weitem nicht so schlecht, wie es die Reviews vermuten lassen. Klar, man hat bei weitem nicht so viele Freiheiten wie bei Stadtbausimulationen wie Cities Skylines oder so freien politischen Lauf wie bei Tropico. Aber das Konzept ist halt auch ein anderes. Man ist Bürgermeister und leitet das Parlament einer vom Volk gewählten Regierung. Man schlägt Gesetze und Steuern vor und je nach dem wie man politisch angesehen ist bei den Parteien, hat man halt mehr oder weniger Erfolg bei der Umsetzung von Gesetzesvorhaben.

Ich kann nicht verstehen, warum so viele Jammern über den Schwierigkeitsgrad. Ja, bei meinem ersten Versuch fand ich es auch noch schwer, nicht ins finanzielle Minus zu geraten. Aber schon beim zweiten Versuch hatte ich damit keine Probleme mehr. 

Es gibt ein paar nervige Bugs (zB kann ich nicht nachvollziehen, warum meine Unternehmen einen Mallus von 20% auf ""Nachfrage"" erhalten, wenn ich einen Bahnhof baue. Ich glaube da wurde ab und zu mal Mallus und Bonus vertauscht. Aber scheinbar nur auf der GUI. Spielmechanisch scheint die Umsetzung korrekt zu sein). Aber ich habe nach 8h Spielzeit keine Showstopper gefunden.

Die Kampagne ist recht langzeitmotivierend und abwechslungsreich. Ab Era 3 wird es etwas eintönig, weil man bis dahin eigentlich gut vorgesorgt hat und nur noch reagieren muss auf politische und gesellschaftliche Veränderungen.

Alles in allem würde ich dem Spiel 7 von 10 Punkten geben.

Der Preis von 30€ ist allerdings schon ziemlich hoch. Ich habe einen Key für 5€ bekommen. Ich denke, der gerechte Preis liegt für dieses Spiel bei 15-20€.",

It’s not worth the asking price, whatsoever.  If you must get it, I recommend you pay as little as possible.

Keep in mind, this is a political simulator masked as a city building game, with an incomplete feel.  If this interests you, then keep reading.  I wanted to like this game and played it over 100 hours, but I strongly dislike it.

Here is why I strongly dislike it:
1) Entirely imbalanced game mechanics at all stages; early-, mid-, and late-game.  At best, consider this game at midway Beta-level test development, requiring a significant rebalance, not ready for prime time.  It’s abandoned by the development team, and therefore they'll never fix its problems.
     Some sillier examples are: [spoiler] you can successfully avoid ever installing running water or a sewer system in densely populated areas; never establish a police station anywhere and achieve better security from just a fire department, even in a population of over 90,000 people, yet install Police call-boxes everywhere to improve (the perception of?) security; drive on the same gravel road from the 1800’s until the end of time with no traffic controls; but muh air-conditioning and recycling center are non-negotiable. [/spoiler]  This doesn’t even scratch the surface of more serious imbalances.

2) Grossly lacks meaningful associations of most causes & effects.  The player may be offered or restricted from certain choices of action without indication of any particular outcome(s).  Likewise, negative and positive unexpected events frequently occur with no indication of how or why, which could allow the player to respond accordingly.  Since the game frequently prompts the player to choose an action but it withholds or obstructs useful information regarding any anticipated outcome (Hint: outcomes are not what you may first think), the player frequently makes blind choices and passively accepts their outcomes.
     For example, one moment your adversarial political parties oppose you; and for reasons unknown within the algorithm, your adversaries’ opinions change.  But the player can’t know why, which offers no opportunity to learn.
     Another example, the tax revenue may fall with no useful data explaining why, though the player must react and fix the unknowable problem to avoid losing the game.
     The development team defends this game design as typical life in politics.  I contend that truly random, inexplicable behavior doesn’t mimic sane real life.  Furthermore, when a political leader makes decisions lacking any practical knowledge of cause & effect, that is unfettered incompetence and cannot make for an enjoyable simulator or satisfying game play.

3) Usable data are delivered to the player in an unusable fashion.  Data are presented as pages and pages and more pages of tables of simple numbers with vague descriptions.  These numbers are a mere granular snapshot of what’s happening within the game at that moment.  Unless the player has extraordinary ability to memorize pages of numbers and compare these pages within one’s mind as time passes (or manually record every number to an external spreadsheet and transform the game into a data-entry simulator), I contend that alternatively these data ought to be delivered as graphs to display event trends.  Otherwise, decision-making defaults to simple guesswork to manipulate particular numbers.

4) The tutorial is sorely lacking.  It guides you through only the initial actions of the game, and leaves most mechanics unexplained.  It focuses on delivering a narrative about people & places that have no practical use.  It won't equip you to develop any strategy to progress.  This you must learn through trial & error, in unclear, uninformative, un-enjoyable ways.  It’s like groping through a dark room for the correct lever to pull among a sea of other levers, where many levers are certain self-destruct mechanisms not identifiable as such, which essentially tricks the player into poor choices.
     You could search outside of the game for serendipitous explanations by watching random Let's Play videos or optimistically trawling online forums.  I don’t consider these suitable game documentation or enjoyable.

5) Beware anytime the tutorial is not yet satisfied with the completeness of your actions, it will silently prevent you from saving your game's progress.  The solution would be to complete the outstanding action; but if done at an undesirable moment (is very likely), you will effectively sabotage any successful strategy you may have had.  If you do not perform the action but also need to shut down the game, you must forfeit all unsaved game progress.  I discovered the community’s recommended workaround is to not begin the game with the tutorial, since it’s optional, but that seems rather self-defeating in purpose.

6) The player can too easily enter into a death spiral that has no recovery.  Since many in-game events occur by inexplicable chance or wonky causes, without useful help to respond, you can somewhat expect to lose the game and need to start over.  If you aren't making obvious successful strides or somehow lose a lot of momentum,  I recommend to quit the game and start over.  Save yourself time and frustration.  Even if you knew what particular choice(s) you could make to a recovery, there remains an artificial “game clock”, as it were, that will restrict your opportunities to make these choices and may shut you out from recovery.   That is, until you discover how to keep the game perpetually afloat, even when it defies reality. 

7) The game play follows a prescribed underlying political narrative, which is a reflection of the development team’s political biases that shine throughout the game.  These biases tend to artificially limit or punish the player if the player makes political choices that contravene these biases. If the player does not align with the narrative, the player will definitely lose the game.  Be aware this is NOT a sandbox game where the player can legitimately explore different playing styles to reach a satisfying outcome.

8) The English text often distracts because it’s unnecessarily wordy, suffers from awkward or incorrect word choice, grammatical errors, etc.  For example, the game offered a choice of actions that I improperly understood because the instructions were too ambiguous.  I guessed my best action according to what I anticipated the game wanted of me (see my earlier comments about the game’s political biases).  Though I did correctly guess what political bias the game expected of me, the game punished me hard because I chose the incorrect course of action that it wanted from me.

9) The game offers a highly detailed, animated 3D model of the city map that has no useful benefit to the game.  It fact, since its function was so poorly optimized, the 3D map serves only to drag down your computer's performance, and does so ever increasingly without end as the game progresses.  Your frame rate will noticeably dip and stutter no matter how powerful your computer, especially during late-game (I progressed beyond the year 2188 and performance became almost unplayable though my computer is plenty powerful).  To what end?  This game is nothing more than reading dialogs and tables of numbers with some basic animations and still-images included for flair.  A still city map viewable from an even higher elevation would have been more useful.

10) The tech progression tree is presented in an arbitrary order with no indication of negative consequences from particular choices.  The tech tree can unwittingly be navigated in a “wrong” order, locking out critical elements of progress when you need them, leaving you no choice but to delete your game and start over.  (See my earlier comment about an artificial “game clock”.)

11) Bugs and more bugs.

     Some sillier examples are: [spoiler] you can successfully avoid ever installing running water or a sewer system in densely populated areas; never establish a police station anywhere and achieve better security from just a fire department, even in a population of over 90,000 people, yet install Police call-boxes everywhere to improve (the perception of?) security; drive on the same gravel road from the 1800’s until the end of time with no traffic controls; but muh air-conditioning and recycling center are non-negotiable. [/spoiler]  This doesn’t even scratch the surface of more serious imbalances.

2) Grossly lacks meaningful associations of most causes & effects.  The player may be offered or restricted from certain choices of action without indication of any particular outcome(s).  Likewise, negative and positive unexpected events frequently occur with no indication of how or why, which could allow the player to respond accordingly.  Since the game frequently prompts the player to choose an action but it withholds or obstructs useful information regarding any anticipated outcome (Hint: outcomes are not what you may first think), the player frequently makes blind choices and passively accepts their outcomes.
     For example, one moment your adversarial political parties oppose you; and for reasons unknown within the algorithm, your adversaries’ opinions change.  But the player can’t know why, which offers no opportunity to learn.
     Another example, the tax revenue may fall with no useful data explaining why, though the player must react and fix the unknowable problem to avoid losing the game.
     The development team defends this game design as typical life in politics.  I contend that truly random, inexplicable behavior doesn’t mimic sane real life.  Furthermore, when a political leader makes decisions lacking any practical knowledge of cause & effect, that is unfettered incompetence and cannot make for an enjoyable simulator or satisfying game play.

3) Usable data are delivered to the player in an unusable fashion.  Data are presented as pages and pages and more pages of tables of simple numbers with vague descriptions.  These numbers are a mere granular snapshot of what’s happening within the game at that moment.  Unless the player has extraordinary ability to memorize pages of numbers and compare these pages within one’s mind as time passes (or manually record every number to an external spreadsheet and transform the game into a data-entry simulator), I contend that alternatively these data ought to be delivered as graphs to display event trends.  Otherwise, decision-making defaults to simple guesswork to manipulate particular numbers.

4) The tutorial is sorely lacking.  It guides you through only the initial actions of the game, and leaves most mechanics unexplained.  It focuses on delivering a narrative about people & places that have no practical use.  It won't equip you to develop any strategy to progress.  This you must learn through trial & error, in unclear, uninformative, un-enjoyable ways.  It’s like groping through a dark room for the correct lever to pull among a sea of other levers, where many levers are certain self-destruct mechanisms not identifiable as such, which essentially tricks the player into poor choices.
     You could search outside of the game for serendipitous explanations by watching random Let's Play videos or optimistically trawling online forums.  I don’t consider these suitable game documentation or enjoyable.

5) Beware anytime the tutorial is not yet satisfied with the completeness of your actions, it will silently prevent you from saving your game's progress.  The solution would be to complete the outstanding action; but if done at an undesirable moment (is very likely), you will effectively sabotage any successful strategy you may have had.  If you do not perform the action but also need to shut down the game, you must forfeit all unsaved game progress.  I discovered the community’s recommended workaround is to not begin the game with the tutorial, since it’s optional, but that seems rather self-defeating in purpose.

6) The player can too easily enter into a death spiral that has no recovery.  Since many in-game events occur by inexplicable chance or wonky causes, without useful help to respond, you can somewhat expect to lose the game and need to start over.  If you aren't making obvious successful strides or somehow lose a lot of momentum,  I recommend to quit the game and start over.  Save yourself time and frustration.  Even if you knew what particular choice(s) you could make to a recovery, there remains an artificial “game clock”, as it were, that will restrict your opportunities to make these choices and may shut you out from recovery.   That is, until you discover how to keep the game perpetually afloat, even when it defies reality. 

7) The game play follows a prescribed underlying political narrative, which is a reflection of the development team’s political biases that shine throughout the game.  These biases tend to artificially limit or punish the player if the player makes political choices that contravene these biases. If the player does not align with the narrative, the player will definitely lose the game.  Be aware this is NOT a sandbox game where the player can legitimately explore different playing styles to reach a satisfying outcome.

8) The English text often distracts because it’s unnecessarily wordy, suffers from awkward or incorrect word choice, grammatical errors, etc.  For example, the game offered a choice of actions that I improperly understood because the instructions were too ambiguous.  I guessed my best action according to what I anticipated the game wanted of me (see my earlier comments about the game’s political biases).  Though I did correctly guess what political bias the game expected of me, the game punished me hard because I chose the incorrect course of action that it wanted from me.

9) The game offers a highly detailed, animated 3D model of the city map that has no useful benefit to the game.  It fact, since its function was so poorly optimized, the 3D map serves only to drag down your computer's performance, and does so ever increasingly without end as the game progresses.  Your frame rate will noticeably dip and stutter no matter how powerful your computer, especially during late-game (I progressed beyond the year 2188 and performance became almost unplayable though my computer is plenty powerful).  To what end?  This game is nothing more than reading dialogs and tables of numbers with some basic animations and still-images included for flair.  A still city map viewable from an even higher elevation would have been more useful.

10) The tech progression tree is presented in an arbitrary order with no indication of negative consequences from particular choices.  The tech tree can unwittingly be navigated in a “wrong” order, locking out critical elements of progress when you need them, leaving you no choice but to delete your game and start over.  (See my earlier comment about an artificial “game clock”.)

11) Bugs and more bugs.

I’ll end it here.  Congratulations if you read everything.  I could add more, but I have other ways I’d prefer to spend my time."

       详细说来：这个游戏实际上是一部“披着城建外衣的[b]政治游戏[/b]”，核心玩法是要求玩家作为市长，要在城市议会中推行各种议案，以达到发展城市的目的。这个游戏的创新性在于，通过城市议会这个窗口，我能体会到城市是由不同种群构成的，不同种群会产生不同的需求，从而产生不同的政治诉求（政党），因此，对于一个中国玩家，这种游戏体验是很新颖的。至于可玩性，我更多的加分项在于如何“调教”出一个能听你话的议会，这是游戏里我认为最有趣的地方，至于我的方法我会在后面写下来给大家参考。在游玩的过程中，我发现，制作组的价值观和目的非常明显地体现在游戏里，就是希望玩家在游戏中一步步推行各种“进步”法案。

       目前在建第四个城市，我认为自己已经摸索到了这个游戏大概得怎么玩，写一些tips给还在摸索的各位玩家，当然，这只是我在总结我前三个失败的城市的基础上得出的经验，欢迎指正：）
[olist]
	[*]总觉得财政盈余不够多的话，[b]大胆加税吧[/b]，我一般会在第一时期议会党派不是那么复杂的时候先把税加到20%，加到20%是够的。
	[*]前期步子不要迈太大，[b]建区三四个，精品一两个[/b],税收主要是靠工商业——特别是工业，基础设施可以优先加建在工商业占比较大的区，燃气、下水道这些对工商业有加成的一定要建。
	[*]所有机构中，在财政许可的情况下，我建设优先顺序一般是“大学>码头>火车站>其他”，[b]特别是大学[/b]，随着时间推移会有各种脑力值（研究点数）加成，这对研究会有极大的提升，又因为这个游戏需要通过解锁科技来解锁各种buff，所以大学可以说是个性价比极高的机构。
	[*]如果在议会中老被极左或者极右党派阻挠，[b]把他们从议会里抹去吧[/b]，具体方法就是把通过监视得到的负面信息散播出去（选择第一个），从而降低刁民再次投票给他们的意愿，其实，当一个区域里经济向好、满意度过关的话，极端党派的得票率一般都不会高到会给玩家带来很大困扰的地步。[i]（我的第二个存档就出现了一种极右党派独大的情况，导致议案无法通过，从而崩盘。在那个存档里，我的基础设施没跟上，导致刁民满意度极低，所以我认为和现实里一样，刁民的满意度与极端政党支持率是明显负相关的）[/i]
	[*][b]特别注意第四时期一个科技叫[u]信息自由[/u][/b]，这个科技提示有个轻描淡写的“增加政府支出”，实际中会增加15%~25%的支出，具体多少不确定，以我的经验，之前盈利300+k，研究一出来，刷的一下跌到亏损100+k，差点没缓过来。

       因为我的玩法就是很社会主义价值观的政治和谐赚钱建大城，上面的几个tips也只适用于同样玩法的玩家，我本身非常好奇游戏有没有什么极端玩法，非常希望有一些有趣玩法的玩家可以留言和我交流：）",

　　這是一款經營城市的模擬遊戲，核心內容是身為市長的你在諸多派系勢力當中取得一席之地並發展城市。這款遊戲比起膾炙人口的天堂島、模擬城市而言，多了、加重了政治角力的成分。

　　經營城市不再只是考慮預算問題，不再只是照表操課滿足居民，任何的進步或改變都需要議會的支持與投票。你不再是上帝，你將更貼近於現實生活中的執政者（現實社會中即便是獨裁者，都必須討好身邊的核心支持者）。如果你喜歡經營決策過程更勝於造橋鋪路，如果你更喜歡政治博弈勝過美輪美奐，這款遊戲值得你收藏。

【個人評分】

　　沉浸性★★★★☆
　　創新性★★★★☆
　　維護性★☆☆☆☆
　　畫面　★★☆☆☆
　　音樂　★★★☆☆
　　ＣＰ值★★☆☆☆（原價）
　　ＣＰ值★★★★★（80%特價）

【遊戲性問題】

　　這款遊戲由於著重政治系統，導致在鋪設設施與策略規劃時躡手躡腳，知易行難，甚至有極端政黨完全反對有利於城市發展的計畫－－這不就是現實世界嗎？在完全熟悉之前，玩家會品嘗到多次如泥濘沼澤一般的停滯與挫折，遊戲的順暢與快感的取得門檻較高，前期投入成本較高，如果您對於決策與政治沒有興趣，建議找其他遊戲來玩。

　雖然議會政治角力對於城市模擬而言是很特別的設計，但其操作大同小異，只是簡單的數值遊戲，而且你無法轉變體制，無論你是在工業時代早期還是二戰結束以後的近代，你都必須維持議會政治，政治的失敗代表你的城市注定落後於時代發展，開銷與市民的滿足條件愈來愈高，最終你將失去政權－遊戲結束。

　　遊戲的拖沓對於沒有耐心或是傳統城市模擬玩家，肯定是很難受的！你的城市的死亡是緩慢的、漸進的、難以逆轉的－就像現實世界的國家也不是一天就淪為失敗國家，而是長期亂政、施政的偏誤、短視、民粹。

【不完善的政治模擬器遊戲】

　　本作中你無法像Ｐ社遊戲一樣以低廉的代價轉換制度，也沒有議會政治以外的玩法，議會政治玩法本身也不夠精彩，例如稅收收到很高也不會引發革命，遊戲裡面也沒有軍隊的設計，不會出現政變；明明你家世世代代都是執政者，卻都沒有培養出自己的政權裙帶，這非常荒謬，使得你必須在整個遊戲過程中經歷大量重複操作性過重的投票與討好，不管是任何法案或是都市規劃！就連你幫城市裝個自來水都需要議員同意。

　　初嘗新鮮，中期開始略顯乏味。如果遊戲能夠加強政治角力的內容，或許這樣的新鮮設計能夠打下一片天－－成為披著政治模擬器的城市經營遊戲。本作絕大多數人給了負評，恐怕是以模擬城市、天際線、天堂島的標準去看待，又或是當初官方給大家的期待太高，但如果你願意嘗試從策略與政治面去經營城市，這款其實還滿有特色的。

【克服議會與早期經濟是遊戲的主要樂趣】

　　不如說，這款遊戲的真正樂趣就在於從看似混亂困難拖沓的議會政治系統中脫穎而出，成為圓融八方卻又茁壯城市的超級執政者。遊戲最好玩的部分在於早期在預算、派系、法案、居民需求皆碰壁的情況白手起家，一步一步走上正軌，並利用稅收來「迷惑」民粹議員，最終成為高稅賦、高滿意、高支持度、高度民主社會主義化烏托邦的經營之神，這其中的爽快感不言而喻。個人建議先自己玩個兩三局體驗一下議會困局之後再看攻略，避免錯過從零開始的快樂。

　　有鑑於此，我最終給了正面評價，這款遊戲的設計讓遊戲更偏向小眾，卻又不夠專精於政治，導致四不像，更像是一款實驗性產品。我喜歡嘗試各種新鮮的東西。目前價格也不貴，特價也一次打到底，推薦入手，遊戲還內建中文化與中文語音，算是有些誠意。另外如果您是法政、社會科學、都市計畫等公共領域的學生，也相當推薦你來嘗試一下，當作一門課題。

　　最近要選舉了，你也可以把它當作柯Ｐ模擬器體驗一下沒有裙帶派系被議會狂轟濫炸多面角力的感覺。",

Your goal is to hold your esteemed position and grow your influence over severaly generations of your family dynasty. You will be deciding on the direction of the city by dealing with the varying and evolving political parties, forging alliances and making rivals as you progress. The one caveat that must be understood upfront is that in order to enjoy this game you must not go into it believing that it is primarily a city builder, like SimCity, Cities: Skylines, or Tropico. It is first and foremost a political simulator with city building being one of the aspects that you deal with during the course of it.

Progression in the game is quite interesting. Every generation has its own narrative choices to make, some of them affecting the political landscape, some affecting the physical city, and some personally affecting your character and their family. Replayability is enhances as there are several families to choose from which all have their own unique family members, personal stories, strengths, and weakness.

Each era has its own set of political parties that you must deal with. At first, there are few and they are relatively easy to balance. As times goes on these parties split into varying ideologies, new parties form, and old parties die off. Each party has its own set of values and expections for your actions and the choices that you make will impact your relationships with them. Good luck pleasing them all, though, as just like in the real world, they are often seeking resolutions on the issues that directly oppose one another. 

Now onto the elephant in the room, the city building. The city building in Urban Empire is actually quite deep and engaging. However, it's very much a slow burn and you engage in it a fraction of the time that you would with a more directly city building oriented game. Each expansion is a political ordeal and is done in district-sized chunks. Adding a new neighborhood can be a challenge as can adding street lights, quality roads, and even utilities to an already existing one. These can be complicated by your current standing with the political parties who, en masse, have the power to utterly veto any changes that you seek to make if you're slipping up in your political game. 

Urban Empire is a game that I have thoroughly enjoyed. It is not a city builder in the classic sense and I believe that's why so many have reviewed it negatively. It does not resemble what you are expecting if you go into it with that mindset and the game will seem slow-paced and overly challenging. I do not recommend it to those specifically looking for a Cities: Skylines experience. However, I very much recommend it to those willing to go into it with an open mind as they will be able to find an excellent, deep political experience with a unique combination of mechanics and narrative choices that I have yet to find anywhere else.","A unique entry in the strategy genre, Urban Empire incorporates many great ideas into a solid political simulator.

Почему она вообще в этом году существует? Это какая-то параллельная реальность, где в Австрии установился социалистический консерватизм по типу советского времён Леонида Ильича Брежнева? Или что? Логичного объяснения этому просто нет. Партия эта, кстати, называется хотя бы не Коммунистическая Партия Австрийского Союза, а Партия Физиократов, что ничуть не менее абсурдно. Физиократы - это такие господа, которые в 50-ые годы занимались исследованием современного им капитализма и к 1820-ому году их учение едва ли актуально. Да и было ли оно, как политическая идеология, актуально хоть в какие-то годы? Когда она было актуально, ещё и идеологий с партиями не было. В игре эта партия позиционирует себя как лоялистская сила по отношению к Австрийской короне, но... тут же голосует за легализацию профессиональных союзов. В Австрийской империи. В той самой, где даже мануфактуры новые запрещали создавать, чтобы не допустить роста численности и активности рабочего класса. Где производство находилось в руках бюрократии, аристократии и ремесленников. Где права буржуазии ущемлялись, а прав пролетариата попросту не существовало. Мы про одну и ту же Австрию говорим? Кто знает, кто знает, но эти лоялисты-социалисты-консерваторы (кто они вообще?) твёрдо стоят на позициях легализации профессиональных союзов. Хорошо, что есть сила, которая способна противостоять этому неконтролируемому росту гражданского общества. И эта сила - либералы! Не ожидали? Либералы в лице Свободной демократической партии против профессиональных союзов. И против экологии! И против прав животных! Комментарии излишне. Либералы, которые против гражданского общества и экологии и за жестокое обращение с животными? Какая-то мрачная антиутопия. Ну, по крайней мере права женщин они признают...

Или голосовать против"", но никакой реальной роли она не играет, если не оказывать ей поддержку всеми силами. Итак, что мы имеем в политике в I эру? Партия Заветы Ильича (Леонида) (сокр. ПЗИ(Л)), Партия либералов-человеконенавистников и Какая-то партия, которая не имеет мнения ни по какому вопросу, но к счастью и не играет никакой роли (сокр. КПКнИМнпКВнкСинИНР).

+ Непряме керування, закони (edicts) як в Tropico.
+ Достатньо складний геймплей: шари суспiльства, податки, полiтичнi iнтриги...
+ Непогано демонструється розвиток суспiльства протягом останнiх 200 рокIв.
+ Гра не настiльки погана, як пишуть у вiдгуках

Мiнуси: 
- Гра ""ультра-лiвацька"", якщо можна так виразитися. Якщо звичайнi закони мають плюси та мiнуси, то ""лiвi"" закони мають лише плюси. Хiрургiчна змiна статi та заборона дослiдiв на тва-ринах подаються як найважливiшi досягнення сьогодення.
- Жахлива оптимiзацiя: у лейтгеймi 5-7 фпс.
- Надскладний learning curve - не можна просто почати грати. Туторiал майже вiдсутнiй та не пояснює усю глибину геймплею (спойлер: дивiться тутори з воркшопу, деякi вельми непогано пояснюють механiки).
- Нема хiнтiв або пiдказок, є лише стейти. ""Ця компанIя на гранi банкрутства"". Чому саме вона на гранi, та що робити - незрозумiло. Треба лазити та читати лiвi форуми та здогадуватися, що саме треба зробити що б розрулити ситуацiю. У грi багато статистичноi iнформацii, з якою було б цiкаво попрацювати, але вона або неповна, або ii недостатньо. 
- Механiки або нелогiчнi, або забагованi. 

Наприклад, є запит на комерцiйнi будiвлi. Видiляю для них зону - вони не будуються. Лiзу на форуми, дIзнаюся що середнiй клас може бути замалий. Дивлюся статистику - середнiй клас є, але нема робочого класу. Як саме розвивати робочий клас, та чи може це бути причиною моєi проблеми - не зрозумiло.

Ich bin also keiner derjenigen, die ein Spiel doof finden, weil es kompliziert ist oder keine ganz so schöne Grafik hat oder nicht beim ersten Versuch durchzuspielen ist. Im Gegenteil. Mir ist klar, dass man sich in solche Spiele teils auch reinbohren muss. Aber Urban Empire ist einfach nicht gut. Was schade ist, weil ich die Grundidee sofort sehr mochte. Aber es ist einfach nicht gut.

Mein Hauptargument ist, dass die Balance des Spiels einfach zu kippelig ist. Eine einzige Fehlentscheidung kann bedeuten, dass das der komplette Durchgang verloren ist. Beispiel: Man investiert in eine bestimmte Infrastruktur (Bahnhof, Gasleitungen o.ä.) zum falschen Zeitpunkt. Das bedeutet relativ schnell das finanzielle Ende, weil die laufenden Kosten mE viel zu hoch angesetzt sind bzw. sich diese Investitionen praktisch überhaupt nicht in zusätzliche Unternehmensansiedlungen, höheren Steuern o.ä. auszahlen. Das ist erstmal eines: Unrealistisch. Und das ist ja schonmal ein ziemlich schwerwiegender Vorwurf an eine Simulation. Ich habe wirklich viele Anläufe gebraucht und zig Userberichte gelesen, um eine Stadt halbwegs zum Laufen zu bekommen, die nicht sofort wieder abschmiert. 

Vollends unspielbar wird Urban Empire aber durch die Epochenwechsel. Von einem Tag auf den anderen erhöhen sich die Ansprüche der Stadtbewohner komplett (Auch unrealistisch). Man muss also in der Vorepoche für die nächste planen und Unterhaltungsgebäude, Polizei- und so weiter bauen, was aber eigentlich nicht geht, weil man finanziell so enorm eingeschränkt ist bzw. auf so dünnem Eis läuft. Eine Investition zu viel - und die Einnahmen- Ausgabenseite ist unrettbar dahin. 

Die Idee mit den dynastischen Geschichten ist ja auch echt nett. Aber auch hier: Es funktioniert nicht. Die Story ist so extrem linear, dass man die Meldungen im vierten Anlauf nur noch wegklickt. Es ist auch kaum erkennbar, ob die ""Entscheideungen"", die man in der Storyline zu treffen hat, ernsthaft einen Unterschied im Aufbau der Stadt machen. 

Letzter Punkt: Was das Spielkonzept ja besnders machen soll ist die politische Balance in der Stadt. Politische Parteien, die - je nach Epoche aber auch Situation in der Stadt - dem Wandel unterworfen sind. Auch eine schöne Idee - aber völlig stumpf umgesetzt. Hat man Geld, stimmt der Stadtrat allem zu. Hat man keines, lehnt er alles ab. Bei den gesellschaftspolitischen Entscheidungen ist - ähnlich wie bei den Investitionen und sonstigen Kennzahlen -- völlig unklar, welche Auswirkungen sie worauf haben und wie das im voraus oder im Rückblick einzuschätzen ist. Warum sich Wirtschaftsansiedlungen und Konjunktur nach oben oder nach unten bewegen und ob und wenn wie sich das auf Steuereinnahmen auswirkt, ist mir bis zuletzt nicht klar geworden. In der ANleitung findet man zu all diesen Spielkonzepten auch null Hinweise.

Ich habe im Netz natürlich auch Leute gefunden, die weiter gekommen sind. Keine Ahnung, ob das ggf. vor irgendwelchen Updates war. Ich jedenfalls bin echt kein Aufbausimluations-Newbie aber ich für meinen Teil hab genug von dem Spiel und kann es nicht empfehlen. Nochmal: Schade.

Ich habe es durch den Gamestar Magazinkauf dazu bekommen und dachte mir zu allererst das es irgendein langweiliges Spiel wäre, allerdings wurde ich positiv überrascht . Es ist was anderes als man sonstige Spiele dieser Art gewöhnt ist. Es ist alles etwas politischer gehalten als bei anderen Aufbauspielen daher würde ich schon fast sagen hat es etwas von Strategie da man immer gut durchdenken muss wie man seine Stadt auf längere Sicht plant.

Da muss ich aber auch leider zu den Kontras kommen. Was momentan noch sehr enttäuschend ist, ist das gegen Endgame fast schon Midgame das Spiel auf höheren Grafikeinstellungen sehr sehr ruckelig wird und das trotz guter Hardware! Nach mehrfachen recherchieren fand ich auch raus das ich nicht der einzige mit diesem Problem bin. Grafik runtergestellt und es ist einigermaßen Spielbar, jedoch wäre es wirklich wünschenswert wenn dies schnellsmöglich behoben wird, da dies sehr Schade für das Spiel wär.

Mein persöhnlicher Fazit ist , dass ich dieses Spiel sehr mag. Ich habe nicht erwartet das es mich die Nacht so lang wach hält wie gewisse AAA Spiele es taten . Ich mag das System dahinter es ist einfach etwas anderes. Klar es ist etwas unkomplizierter was den Aufbau betrifft und es gibt einem nicht so viel Möglichkeiten wie in anderen gewissen Spielen. Dennoch finde ich hat es einen persöhnlichen Touch vorallem durch dieses Politiksystem was einem auch klar zeigt das man in diesem Spiel nicht der ""Gott"" sondern der ""Bürgermeister"" ist . Daher finde ich ist es sehr realisitschen gehalten ebenso wie die Epochen über die Zeit und das Forschungssystem. Daher gibt es von mir definitiv einen Daumen hoch , dennoch sollte das Mid/Endgame umbedingt gepatcht werde da es sonst irgendwann unspielbar wird!",

Poder dirigir una ciudad, crear los distritos, ver que tecnologías le interesan más y todo ello acompañado de un ingrediente político enorme, de verdad que me parecía que podía ser el city builder con más política del momento y probablemente de nunca. Y aunque no decepciona en la idea  por momentos se hace difícil evolucionar la ciudad de forma paralela y eso es bastante realista, cuesta llegar a consenso con los demás miembros de la cámara. En innovador pero, a veces está falto de explicaciones y sobre todo y creo que este es el mayor problema que puede arrastrar, es un juego con una necesidad de leer y entender lo que pasa enorme por lo que para los hispanohablantes tener que hacerlo 100% en ingles se convierte a veces en un engorro. Es incomprensible y yo, en este caso, me voy a unir al carro de las críticas negativas principalmente por que no esté en mi idioma, como puede ser que Kalypso media, dueña de Trópico de 5 Trópicos, aunque solo 4 sean buenos, ha dejado que este juego tenga versiones en idiomas tan variados como el Ruso o el Chino simplificado y se haya olvidado de que el segundo idioma más hablado del planeta es el Castellano con sus distintas variantes. Esto es realmente imperdonable a día de hoy. No tener ni siquiera el detalle de poner los textos en castellano en pleno 2018. Y para ponerle la guinda a este pastel, ni siquiera hay posibilidad de crear mods que puedan suplir esta falta, Kalypso a ver si aprendes de otros estudios como ParadoX....Por ello no le recomiendo a nadie gastarse un céntimo en este juego, antes aconsejaría jugar a No Man´s Sky.",

All others don't matter, because an industry district will make you 3-5x more than any other district, and the others will only break even.

The tooltip is frequently wrong, and frequently broken, if it exists at all.

The game is not at all balanced; if you want to make money (which isn't necessarily required, but it is useful), then you should never change anything about your districts - just make sure your industry districts fill up. All others don't matter, because an industry district will make you 3-5x more than any other district, and the others will only break even. And that's unfortunate, because the infrastructure part of the game looks really interesting - there's just no financial reason to make use of it (after copious testing, I found that most infrastructure cost more in maintenance than it would improve in income - a few times it might break even).

But the core concept of the game is solid."

I have at the time of writitng this 44 hours in this game.
The game has several issues, they are:

1. Income to expenditure ratio seems off, I am constantly having to raise taxes on my cities to ridiculous levels in order to provide basic amenidies, I feel that this should have been tweeked slightly to make roads, sewers and other infurstructure less expensive. Think about the fact that place cobble stone roads in a 4 block city cost almsot as much  in maintence and innital cost as a port or railroad.

2. You have to grow fast in order to be able to afford to upgrade fast (in my experience)

3. A 4 district city can only support 5000 people in a medium density setting. the population is generally very hard to grow (and thereby income taxation is always lower than I would like). The amount of population you get should be tweeked to be slightly higher.

4. The interface for some of the politcal decisions doesn't work as intended, for mayoral elections you have to go into the council screen and click several times in order to be able to affect your relection (unlike other decisions that can be accesed through the city screen, ie normal screen)

5. You can't make people  not vote for a bill. Occasionaly parties in the council will try to lower taxes or introduce laws, you can't sway people against these laws. You can only sway parties towards passing them.

6. Mayoral elections and councils in most countries don't invole 6 different parties as the eras go on parties come and go but they also grow in number this goes against what happens in real world elections with 2 major parties and one or two minor ones, added to this the parties don't seem to grow naturally the game just decieded who is in power and how many representatives they have, I don't feel like i can actually change the popualtirty of parties very much. The Nazi party for example (the justice party) never passes any thing in my city nor does the christian party, there supports should vote them out if they don't do there job while the communist and social democrats alway have legislation passed, yet these don't seem to factor into elections.

No party ever seems to gain a majority the highest is 40-21% of the vote if i recal properly, I get that this most likely so you have to get lots of parties to pass things but I just want to have the council debate while i make the city have running water and other cool things oh and universities.

Não é um jogo de simulação de contrução de cidades. É um simulador de políticas locais através do tempo.

Você escolhe uma família, ou uma dinastia para governar uma cidade no interior do Império Áustro Húngaro, numa região indecisa pela independência ou não, conforme as eras passam, os partidos políticos se renovam, assim como as políticas e as tecnologias vão evoluindo. Neste jogo, você não decide o que será feito na cidade, e sim um conselho de representantes, você terá que lidar com os vários interesses representados no conselho, podendo utilizar de sua persuasão através da lábia, ou de seu prestígio ou por meios indiretos (descubram vocês mesmos!).

Inovador ao colocar em um jogo como funciona a política local, desde a instalação dos distritos (bairros), até das construções que irão ser colocadas neles, como praças, escolas e tudo o mais, inclusive podendo colocar em votação as taxas de manutenção dos serviços e inclusive o seu próprio salário.

Pode ser um tanto cansativo o sistema de votações, ainda mais se ficarem recusando sempre as suas proposituras, mas... Bem vindo! Este é o jogo mais próximo de planejamento e política disponível até hoje.

Não é um jogo para se brincar de deus, como  muitos outros por aí, talvez seja o melhor jogo para se divertir com gerenciamento político. Ok, não é a praia de muitos por aqui, vemos isto nas eleições, onde todo mundo acha que sabe o que está fazendo, mas poucos possuem a consciência da real responsabilidade.

Enfim, esta é pra ser uma análise do Urban Empire, não da dificuldade das pessoas em compreenderem além das suas limitadas capacidades. Falando nisso, é um jogo com muito potencial, poderia ter DLC´s ou uma ótima continuação.

There is no downside to higher taxes.  For example, I have industry taxes at 50% but still have highest demand for industrial zones possible in the game.  In the game its silly not to raise taxes all the time to pay for city services, which incredibly enough can provide and solve everything your populace could ever want.  Nor is there really an upside to lower taxes, one era I put commercial taxes at 5% and the next era back up to 35% (I didnt have time to get them all the way up to 50%)...Theres no difference.  Judging by the steam discussions I think other players have struggled with this disconnect from reality as well.

The majority of choices have no downsides (I want to say all choices, but some have a minor cost).  None.  Which really robs the game of any strategy.

The game is supposed to be a ""mayor"" political simulator but I can probably count on one hand the number of times the council didnt just rubber stamp (by which I mean an overwhelming majority) whatever issue I wanted them to vote on.  The only restraining factor was you can only press one kind of issue at a time (taxation, district upgrade, etc.) and it takes 3 months to a 1 year to get them to vote.  Honestly the mayor race was the only consistent issue that required me to do anything.

You can have the highest possible city happiness, low unemployment, etc etc and even as the incumbent during elections most political parties will favor the challenger forcing you to use up your political capital....which you may as well because you never really need it.

Every single improvement for every single district requires a majority vote.  I get it, its a ""mayor"" simulator, but lets say you want to introduce high speed internet to your city.  By this point you will have over 20+ districts, you need to go to each district, upgrade it, and then wait because each vote requires at least 3 months (if you use prestige to force a vote as soon as possible)....for each and every district, one at a time.  There are about two dozen or so upgrades so most of the time youre just shoving through a handful of improvements at a time because you dont have time for anything else, especially in the last two or three eras (there are five).

Partirei con i pro, giusto per correttezza:
L'interfaccia è molto ricca e completa, e ti permette di tenere monitorato tutto quanto. Molto bello il sistema di ricerca delle innovazioni(in fin dei conti, un pò quello che è successo in questi 100/200 anni, dalla rivoluzione industriale ai giorni nostri), molto carini gli edifici(sia industriali, commerciali che civili), bella la possibilità di creare dei quartieri(o distretti). Ma secondo me, quello che mi spinge di più a consigliare questo gioco, è il sistema politico(che almeno da quanto so, lo si trova soltanto qui). Sembra davvero di dover gestire una vera città: Per ogni decisione(sia che devi aumentare tasse, sia che deviu aumentare fondi, sia che devi approvare leggi, sia che devi approvare finanziamenti) devi fartele votare tutte dal consiglio cittadino, che inizialmente ha pochi membri, ma verso la fine diventano abbastanza e ciò rende più impegnativo il tutto). Una menzione va fatta anche ai potenziamenti urbani, che da un minimo di 2 all'inizio del gioco, passano a più di 6, man mano che studi l'innovazione. Infine, vorrei ritornare sul sistema politico: 
all'interno del consiglio cittadino, troviamo la barra dei voti(rosso-non approvato, arancione-indecisi, verde-approvato) che rende molto realistica la cosa, che per ogni avvenimento, devi convincere i partiti di maggioranza a votare a favore(o anche contro eh!). Belli anche gli intrighi politici e gli scandali. La grafica è bella, davvero. 

E ora i contro:
le meccaniche sono vecchie...e a certi tratti obsolete, gli edifici pubblici da costruire sono pochi e nei distretti non puoi piazzare ne case, ne edifici commerciali, ne aziende(fa tutto in automatico e in alcuni casi può essere fastidioso, perchè comunque gli spazi son pochi, e puoi dosare la densità con un grafico...ma a volte fai comunque fatica), le aree di costruzione hanno una forma minima e in certi casi ti trovi ad arrivare ai bordi della mappa senza che puoi costruire. Ma le cose che secondo me fanno perdere molti punto sono due: la lIngua e QUALCHE comparto grafico. 
La lingua, secondo me è inconcepibile non metterla in Italiano, considerando che il Team è Europeo ed hanno inserito pure il Cinese. Perciò consiglio questo gioco a chi, come me per dire, ha almeno una conoscenza avanzata di Inglese(per gestire tutti gli aspetti politici, finanziari e gli eventi del gioco...a volte non basta la conoscenza basica...). Il comparto grafico ha spesso dei Log e i tempi di caricamento sono lunghi....

In definitiva: Bel gioco, lo consiglio assolutamente(se siete degli anni 90 come me, ancora di più!) ma occhio alla lingua !",

This game is like a blend between ""Democracy 3"" by Positech Games, and SimTown by Maxis -- except you cannot place every building, road or tree in the City, because that is not the focus of this game. The tech tree evolves as time progresses from one era to the next, unlocking new institutions and facilities as new tech is researched.

The play style takes some getting used to, with a large part of the game ""encouraging"" other councillors to vote the way you want them to. Once photography is developed in the tech tree, you can spy on other parties in the council to dig up dirt on them to be used as leverage, if you need to get a vote passed which they don't agree with.

The political system does not make the game easy in places -- it helps to have a fair bit of personal wealth behind your character in some instances to pay for institutions or changes to the city which the council does not approve of -- but overall I think they've struck a good balance between it being too easy and too difficult.

Since this game is a bit pricey given all the negative reviews, I would recommend people wait until it's on sale - anywhere from $10 to $15 USD (or lower) is good value for a game like this.","I'm surprised there are so many negative reviews, although I've read that the game was more difficult and buggy when it was launched, so maybe that's partly why.

Politics boil down to managing your influence and choosing which votes you want to win and which ones you don't mind losing. It sounds like it will be fun, but it devolves into tedium extremely fast, to the point that every time you open up the vote screen (which isn't skippable...) you want to groan a bit and get it over with because the outcome of the vote - pass or fail - is known well in advance the majority of the time. 

The city building is obtuse, with a UI that does a very poor job making clear what would be of most benefit to your city at any given time. Further, you have very, very little control over the city, as almost every single thing you do goes to a vote, and many times you just can't win. Reminiscent of reality? Sure. Fun gameplay? Hardly.

Really, one of the problems the game has is the fact that is has many different systems - politics, dynasty, city building (kinda), technology - and it does a very, very poor job of making them comprehensible to the player and 'connecting the dots' between the systems so it's transparent in how that interact. Transparency in systems is an essential part to any strategy game; without transparency, strategy becomes random (frustrating) chance, which is too often what you get in Urban Empire.

Icing on the bad cake - optimization is poor. The best thing the game does is lag on higher speed settings, even if you have a beefy machine.

The game sounds great on paper. I love strategy games. I love city builders. I love RPGS. Match made in heaven? But I've tried playing this game on several occassions and every time the game has lacked one essential thing - fun.

На другом аккаунте, пока болел, несколько дней подряд с нее не вылазил. Я поклонник издательства игр Kalypso Media Digital, и рад, что они продолжают выпускать в мир новые продукты.

Хотя игра больше рассчитана на политическую составляющую, чем строительную, это добавляет в нее свою уникальность, из-за чего в нее интересно играть тем, кто быстро устает от частой схожести с другими продуктами и их однообразия. Игра знакомит нас с историей на протяжении двух веков, что довольно интересно и познавательно. Имеет довольно приятную, не надоедающую музыку. Думаю, кому понравились игры The Guild, Цивилизация и Cities: Skylines (скорей всего вместе взятые, так как от каждой из них в Urban Empire что-то есть), а также кто ценит уникальность и познавательность тоже смогут получить удовольствие от этой игры.

Отрицательную оценку ставлю по следующим причинам:
1) игра не требовательна к железу, почему такие долгие загрузки сохранений?
2) графика - только при максимальном приближении радует глаз. Если камеру отдалить, кажется, что игра выпущена в начале 2000х годов (до 2010 года). Kalypso давно на рынке видеоигр и, я думаю, этот момент тоже позволительно улучшить.
3) игра не бета-версия - почему она просто так вылетает (за первый вечер четыре раза вылетела, без запросов на отчет об ошибке и т.д, что довольно критично при долгой загрузке, хотя в следующие дни не вылетала)? Еще встречаются глюки, когда игра не правильно считывает данные по показателям довольства (все параметры в окне города падают на 5 единиц ниже из 10ти - помогает только либо перезапуск, либо перезагрузка, что тоже критично при долгой загрузке сохранений)

Хотелось бы, чтобы разработчик не опускал руки и продолжал улучшать этот продукт и выпускать новые, взирая на отзывы покупателей.",

随着游戏的发展，玩家可以研究新的科技，解锁新的法案，建设新的基础设施。家族感和时代感很强。
如果想玩有着强烈时代感的城市模拟游戏，我就推荐这款游戏了。

这款游戏的短板也很明显
1，游戏内的数值太多。
游戏内给玩家显示了各种各样的数值，给人一种管理庞大负责城市的感觉。但事实上很多数值对城市的影响微乎其微，只有钱是游戏中绝对重要的东西。管理好了钱之后的发展都没啥问题。
2，操作过程很乏味。
这游戏房屋的建设都是自动建设的，玩家要做的事情就是划地块就行了。而划地块只在整个游戏中占极少数的时间，玩家绝大多数的时间都在议会里面通过法案，然后等游戏结束。
3，优化不足开发商跑路。
我显卡是GTX970，但游戏后期只能到15帧左右。我游戏是17年12月玩的，这游戏就1月发售之后，5月份出了个DLC之后再也没更新过。感觉bug都没人修制作组都放弃了。官网和官方facebook都是很久没打理过的状态了，有人在上面骂也没人关。

整个游戏的游戏体验还是很独特的，如果可以忍受上述不足，建议打折的时候入手。","The gaming experience is quite good.
As the game progresses, players can research new technologies, unlock new laws, and build new infrastructure. It has a strong sense of family and time.
If you're looking for a city simulation game with a strong sense of time, I recommend this game.

The game's shortcomings are also quite obvious.
1. Too many in-game stats.
The game displays a variety of stats, giving the impression of managing a massive and responsible city. However, many of these stats have little impact on the city. Only money is absolutely crucial in the game. Once you manage your money well, development is straightforward.
2. The control process is tedious.
House construction in this game is automated, and all you have to do is mark out plots of land. Marking plots only takes up a very small portion of the game's time; the vast majority of your time is spent in parliament passing bills and waiting for the game to end.
3. The game lacks optimization, and the developer has run away.
My graphics card is a GTX970, but in the later stages of the game, it only reaches around 15 FPS. I played the game in December 2017. After its release in January and the release of DLC in May, the game hasn't been updated since. It feels like the team has given up on the game, and no one's fixing the bugs. The official website and Facebook page haven't been updated in ages, and even when people criticize it, no one shuts it down.

The overall game experience is quite unique. If you can tolerate the aforementioned shortcomings, I recommend buying it while it's on sale."

Urban Empire - политическая стратегия с графикой и геймплеем ""на любителя"", мягко говоря.

Плюсы: 1. Сложность и реалистичность игрового процесса - эта политическая стратегия не из легких. 2. Роль мэра - в данной игре Вы почувствуете себя мэром, однако будущее города определяете Вы только частично, так как существует городской совет с политическими партиями левого и правого фронта, с которыми Вы должны уметь находить общий язык, именно поэтому политическая стратегия не из легких.

Минусы: 1. Неоправданная стоимость - откровенно говоря, игра на заядлого любителя стратегий и большинству попросту не придется по вкусу: сложность, средняя графика. 2. Игра на раз - если Вы один раз прошли игру, то будете знать, как будет происходить сюжет полностью, а строится он вокруг нескольких эпох. 

Рекомендуется для игры только любителям стратегий",

BUT it is a challenging game that has several unique twists to the city building/political simulation genre that makes it worth a buy if you can get it on sale, especially if you grab it from Humble and give a few cents at charity.

The gameplay is far different from Tropico and Cities Skylines, so don't go into this expecting either of those games, nor go into it expecting a lot of hand-holding which is rare these days. Once you get a basic grip on how to get the game to tick along it becomes enjoyable, if a bit difficult at times. If I had to compare the game to other games, I'd say that it runs closer to The Guild series of games then other city sims, because your guiding a family, and a city, through the ages.

Overall, is this game perfect? No, no it's not. Is it decent, playable and enjoyable? Yes, it is, just not at full price. I would highly reccomend giving this a try if you can get a good deal on it, especially because it has potential to be improved in the future with further patches, if Kalypso and Reborn do release more updates, but even if they don't it's a pretty decent game as is, a strong 7 out of 10.

Good Points:
- Like Tropico there is a great dynamic between different areas of the game (research in particular), many moving parts to manage and so many stats to sink your teeth into. The writing is in true Tropico comedic style, with a couple easter eggs thrown in!
- The politics work...okay. In principle (again), the idea is great and works well at times. In certain (repeated) scenarios though the game ties your hands with unworkable parties. I like the favour-appeal system though which does allow you to get around some tricky situations.
- The city builder is again...ok. It's clunky but does the job. It's fairly simple.
 
Bad Points:
- On that note: Finance. It's really hard to keep your finances up and often completely unclear as to why some districts perform well when others dont. You try to upgrade your districts within the slim margins you have but you inevitably end up sinking into the red. I will keep trying different ways and update on this.
- As mentioned above, the politics can get predictable and there's a particular scenario (far-right stronghold) that makes it really hard to get anything done. This impacts finance and city development a lot, wasting loads of time.
- It took me a while to work out that the special buildings (port, train, etc) are the only way to keep your bank balance afloat...for a bit.
- The game is buggy. It crashes a lot, which might explain the frequent autosave. Some actions don't correspond to the result and it's really unclear how certain decisions impact trade. Often you get 3 choices but can only see the results of 2 in advance (bug). 

Tldr: If you liked Tropico, you might like this because it contains the same humour. It's a good idea as a game, I'd love to play a finished version one day. 5/10","As a lover of the Tropico series, I went against the reviews and bought the game on sale for around $10.

Cependant, la complexité de ce jeu, les multiples possibilités et variantes en font un jeu passionnant et complexe. Out le city builder, ici on parle de macrogestion d'une ville, beaucoup plus proche du réalisme que dans un ""Sim city"". Les tactique au conseil de ville, l'espionnage, le jeu d'influence.

The concept sounds promising: Real cities don't exist in a vacuum and mayors aren't dictators, so why not introduce some political and historical elements into gameplay?

Unfortunately, the execution is flawed. In-game history pretty much follows a pre-determined path based on real-world European history: You have monarchy giving way to democracy, workers fighting for better working conditions, women's suffrage, etc. (Note: Some players apparently perceive this as 'leftist ideology', but I'd argue it's simply a representation of the developments during this period. European society at the time of the Industrial revolution was far more authoritarian and conservative than what we have today, so in order to get from there to here, things had to 'move to the left'.)

The problem is that this leads to repetitive gameplay. It may be realistic that a single mayor can't change the course of history, but it also means that you can't really explore alternative options but simply have to go with the flow. Public opinion will always shift a certain way around a certain time, and if you want to stay in office, you always have to adapt in the same ways. Basically, the political part is more about reacting to a pre-written script than about having any actual influence, and that just gets old really fast. Research is similarly restricted: Get certain techs for certain improvements, so you can do the things the script needs you to do at this time.

It's a pity, because there technical side of the game is perfectly fine for the genre. They just couldn't find a way to make the gameplay engaging for more than an hour or two. At full price (currently 45 EUR), it's definitely way too expensive. If you can pick it up for $10/ 10 Euros or less, it might be worth a look.

You do not lay roads individually or place zones where you want them (although I wish you could for the zones at least), you build a city through the eyes of a politician through an old world council - or, more precisely, a European-based political cabinet. It's a different take and challenge and I welcome it. I am not debating its mechanics since I'm just starting out, but the first impression that it has been wrongly given. You cannot approach this game with the typical city sim mentality, at all. You have to carefully balance your budget, understand how to grow you city while also balancing party influence so that you can continue to build since (depending upon your political emphasis) people can vote you out if there is too much conflict from yours and other political parties.

***===============================================***
Update: I've played a game all the way through every stage to the point you get a victory. (This took 19hrs and it was my very first game - no redos.) In my case, I managed the victory of making it through every stage. (I wasn't paying too close of attention, since I continued onward with the game (I'm glad it gave me that option), but it appears you go to the year 2020.) 

What's my impression? I love this game. It is very challenging and for a while there I wasn't sure I was going to make it, but got to Stage V and the economy was easier to manage. (My city was so poor and in the red for a long time that only a few districts had the privilege of running water and even fewer had electricity.) I definitely learned a few things about establishing an economy and am excited to try a whole new game to see what I can make happen. 

I really like the storytelling aspect to it as you get to create a kind of history with your game that is rather faint (but left to your imagination) when I would play Civ games or the Total War games or any city sim game - this seemed more personal. I do wish when there were world conflicts (and possibly smaller ones that might affect you) that you felt it and had to make choices like you do any other time. (For example, since you do get the arms industry, I thought perhaps you might try to promote that industry during a war or have a political aspect that may involve a vote on helping another country out or something.) That would really make you feel like you're part of a bigger world instead of feeling closed in to the city that you're building. The game hints at some sort of economic hit, but that's all I could tell. 

But it was exciting and frustrating in every regard that made this game interesting. It is a pitty that it had a rough start and it is a greater pity that a lot of people are not seeing this game at a different, and deserved, angle since there is potential to make this super interesting if the developers went deeper into this game.

It is a pitty that it had a rough start and it is a greater pity that a lot of people are not seeing this game at a different, and deserved, angle since there is potential to make this super interesting if the developers went deeper into this game. I'd say with the big upset, the devs have better time spent with something else..."

En préambule est ce que ce jeu est parfait? Non. Est ce que des fois on s'arrache les cheveux parce qu'on est bloqué? Oui!

mais il a un vrai potentiel et jusqu'a présent je le trouve vraiment immersif.

je le trouve beaucoup plus réaliste que les city builders traditionnels. Le maire ne construit pas lui même son réseau d'eau par exemple. j'aime la gestion du conseil municipal, qui vous mange dans la main quand tout va bien et qui s'oppose à tout quand çà va mal; ca rend le jeu compliqué mais moi j'aime bien çà.
Il a des mécanismes financiers à prendre à compte, comme le fait de laisser un quartier se déveloper avant de rajouter le gaz ou l'eau sinon le budget en prend un coup.

Au final c'est à mon avis un bon jeu à condition de ne pas y chercher ce qu'il n'est pas. Ce n'est pas un pur city builder.

et depuis l'achat de ce jeu, je me méfit des jeux fait par de grand éditeur, car on parle quand même de Kalypso, les mecs qui avait remis Tropico aux devant de la scène qui d'allieurs aux passage, le jeu Urban Empire fait un petit clin d'oeil sur ce dernier, mais non de dieu, je me suis fait avoir, et cette référence ne pas la sauver du tout,

Malgré qu'il la voulu parti dans une très bonne attention de mélangé City Buider et Politique, cela reste ma plus grosse aranque après SimCity (2013), car c'est pas que être déçu, mais j'appel ça une aranque, et le pire, c'est que, je l'avais achter d'avance, pour vous direz de la plus grosse c.o.n.n.e.r.i.e que j'ai fait sur Steam, car j'achter jamais les jeux à l'avance en foncent dans le tas, 

et cela m'aura bien appris une bonne chose, ""Même si c'est bien devant, rassure toi que se soit pas de la m.e.r.d.e par dernier"" car c'est pas avec de beau graphique en HD, que le jeu sera pas super, alors attention à vous amateur de jeux de gestion, ce jeu est une aranque,

       一开始我是拒绝的，我们叔依斯家族世世代代都是银行家，对于当个市长完全是没有兴趣的

[strike] 但皇帝陛下一撒娇，我竟然羞耻的答应了，现在想想真的甚是后悔[/strike] 

       犹记得那是1820年，皇帝左手一个圈圈，萨瓦利亚特别行政区成立了，作为新市长，我指点江山画出一个框框，好的就你了

米尔顿特别行政区！然后我自掏腰包造了一个市政厅，真是美滋滋，想想我们叔依斯家族的千秋大业就此开始心里还有点小激动呢

然而当我建造第二个行政区时，我有点奇怪了，诶，我市长的指示，为什么要听屁民们表决，后来我才知道，其实，我放个屁也要

屁民议会同意[strike] 仔细想想这句话没毛病[/strike] ，不过幸好，我很快就死了，和我一起灭亡的还有保守党

[strike] 欧耶，不亏[/strike] 

       接下来，一道圣光，我咻的一下钻进了儿子的意志里，还没等我回过神，秘书拉起我的手，诶诶，先锋党和自由党打起来了诶

这可怎么办啊，市长你快想想办法，说时迟那时快，我拉开两人：好好说话，不要打架。虽然挨了自由党一拳，先锋党一脚，不过

架到时拉开了，两派关系也缓和了起来，不过他俩却异口同声回头骂道市长你个二五仔，[strike]天啦撸这是造了什么孽[/strike] 

不过幸亏这个儿子也没活多久世界进入了电气时代

       当然，我这个孙子好啊，风流倜傥，深受姑娘们喜爱，没想到这次，屁民们说竞选上人吧，诶诶诶，不亏不亏，好在我深受姑

娘们喜爱，一二战男性居民不多，我妥妥坐稳了宝座，谁料壮志未酬身先死，与屁民会斗智斗勇的我只通过了几个法案，这烟酒专

卖恐怕是我这辈子的遗憾了

       诶呀呀，曾孙女可不得了，电影明星网红脸，[strike]嘿嘿嘿太爷爷我就不客气了[/strike] 没想到经济危机打垮了一切，原本的

轻重工业全部萧条，耗尽了祖祖辈辈的基业扶持也无济于事，居民要求出奇的高，各党派用自己的智障行动天天刷低萨瓦迪亚人民

的智商下限，媒体纷纷跟风职责说女明星当什么市长，

       在一个风雨交加的夜晚，大选落幕，我落选了，而我终于也逃脱了祖祖辈辈受屁民议员摆布的命运，摆脱了我的私人存款天天

要地方扶持的命运，随着身体的一阵抖动，一切变得释然，没有一个屁民为市长哀悼，甚至都没有在胖友圈发个R.I.P，现在想想，

我只想对议员说：[i][u] 分男女搭配[/u][/i]，对屁民说：[i][u] 燃烧你的梦[/u][/i] [spoiler] 如不理解请参考王老菊语录[/spoiler]

如果上天能再给我一次机会，我想对皇帝陛下说：这火臣传不了啊！！！！

I have played up to the 3rd Era with each family, and through the 5th Era with the von Pfilzen family & the Shuskys. I have enjoyed EACH of my playthroughs enough to say that I would recommend this game.

The main criticisms of this game seem to be shutdowns, errors, and similar issues. I am speaking as someone with a Dell Latitude E6410 laptop I got for free from my old job that was donating them to a local school. I have played hours upon hours with NO issues whatsoever. Granted, this is at the lowest settings, but if you have a crap computer then don't expect brand new games to work like your playing on your PS4.

Most of the ACTUAL gameplay criticisms are in regard to the politics. I find the politics to be a bit...odd. I mostly enjoy the politics, but it seems a bit disconnected. If the political party likes you, they will always like you IF you dont annoy them all the time. If a party does NOT like you, there is nothing you can do. HOWEVER, once you get used to how the political side of the game works, it becomes no more annoying than any other thing in any other game.

My only other criticisms are the lack of a good tutorial, only having 3 maps to choose from, and being forced to watch my conservative aristocratic family turn into a radical liberal family.

All of that being said, I recommend this game because it is pretty much exactly as advertised. You do NOT have 100% control over every building, every citizen, every law, etc. You may PROPOSE the building of new districts, however you will have to get the various parties to vote in your favor. You may get that new district built, however it will be up to your citizens to build the various buildings. Then again, they may not build new buildings...perhaps due to heavy taxation, or whatever. When new buildings are built, they may be profitable...or they may go bankrupt. The world is NOT your oyster. You are a Mayor, not ""El Presidente"" Dictator.

This game does NOT deserve the terrible rating it has been given. This is a VERY niche game, but it isnt terrible for what it is and what it is trying to be. Is it worth $40 (USD)? Heck no, but if you are eyeballing this game and see it on sale...get it. Get it, and enjoy it for what it is...a new niche take on a classic game archetype.

UPDATE: Just purchased a much newer computer with all the bells and whisles. When it arrives, I will be redownloading and replaying this game to compare, and will update this review if needed.

Final Update, 1/24/2024: All these years later, I have a grand total of ~30 hours invested in the game, and never downloaded it or played it since 2017. Reflecting on my memories of this game, compared to the MANY other types of games in this niche that Ive played since then, I have changed my recommendation to ""No"" to reflect the waste of money this was. I stand by my original, contemporary review of the game from 2017, and still remain confused as to why some folks immediately assumed I was a fanboy or something (I never heard of the developer before, I only found the game through steam lol) just for having a different take at the time. But yea, no one will see this, but I cant stand that one of the few reviews I ever left for any game just doesnt reflect the long-term truth. Ive played CivCity: Rome more often since 2017 than Urban Empire, on my custom built new rig that is very much not a potato laptop like I had back in 2017. That pretty much says it all.

Urban Empire is a game developed by Reborn Games and published by Kalypso Media Digital. I love city building games. I love politics. I love running a city when it comes to politics, so technically, I should love Urban Empire...

When it was first announced, I was incredibly excited, however, I started to reduce my hype when I found out Kalypso Media Digital was publishing it after their bad track record with other games except maybe the Tropico games and the high price point, nearly 45 EUR! Thankfully, I waited for a sale and bought it on Humble Bundle for only 20 EUR

Urban Empire starts wonderfully exciting. To start, it has open territory to place your districts, a council to influence, and support from the emperor to get you going. The game remains fun while you create and grow your first couple of districts and through the entire first era. As the game goes on each era becomes more and more repetitive, and the errors in and problems with the game become more apparent

What I like from Urban Empire is the premise of growing a city through political wrangling with the option of the families; though I wish there were a few more of them from which to choose and the politics of the council and the parties

What I don't like from Urban Empire and there are loads... Firstly, the decision tool tips: in many cases there aren't any tool tips and fluff/story-based decisions out or order

Replayability is severely lacking. In my experience: progressive agenda issue (for the era) proposed multiple times, even if vote fails or overruled. Conservative policies (for the era) are one-and-done. Both the council and the populous should be a bit more randomized every play though. This would allow for more replayability

All families should be able to win based on their ideals. Populist or Liberal Western ideals shouldn't be the only path to victory

There is loads of lag nearing the endgame. This game is horribly optimized, if my PC can play The Witcher 3 on Ultra, then it should play Urban Empire with no problems, yet it doesn't

Whether it's on the city map or even in the city council starting in Era IV the game becomes very, very laggy. There's no point in even moving the camera over my city unless fully paused, and waiting 3-5 seconds for a button click to register is not ideal

Urban Empire has bad spelling grammar which I'm not too worried about this, and I'm by no means perfect, but it should be noted that they could use a better English editor to fix the numerous spelling and grammar errors

Based on price and experience, for now, I have to give this game a thumbs down. However, it is my sincerest hope that mods and patching will really improve both the primary experience and the replayability of Urban Empire

I want to love the game, and I think I can if they take a good hard look at what city building combined with politics can fully offer. But it seems like Reborn Games and Kalypso Media Digital have completely thrown Urban Empire out of the door and left it to rot...

Schade

--------

Ist mein erstes Review, aber die vielen schlechten Reaktionen sind bisschen übertriben. 
Ich habe mir das Spiel trotz der sehr schlechten Kritik gekauft.

Man sucht ja wieder mal was neues, und das scheint ein wenig neu zu sein. 

Es ist halt nicht ein sehr einfaches Spiel, ein paar schlechte Entscheidungen oder die Ratsmitglider die schlecht gelaunt sind oder die Haushaltskasse im Minus und schon hat man nur noch rote Zahlen und kommt nicht oder sehr schlecht mehr aus dem raus.

Nach ein paar mal neu anfangen, habe ich nun doch den Dreh langsam raus und komme schon recht weit. Es lohnt sich einfach am Ball zu bleiben.

Was ich nicht so toll finde ist die Update politik des Spieleherstellers, seit Januar ist es draussen und hat doch hohe Performance Probleme, da spielt es dann auch keine wirkliche Rolle ob man die Grafikquali auf Niedrig oder Extrem stellt, ab eine gewissen grösse verliert das Spiel FPS, ich denke dies sollte bei einer GTX970 und I7 3. Generation trotzdem flüssig laufen, da muss der Hersteller noch nachbessern, leider erscheint seit Februar keine News mehr, ich hoffe da kommt noch was, wäre echt schade.

Ein paar zusätze oder mehr infos wären toll, man Stimmt über was ab, hat ein Telefon oder plappert mit der Freundin und wenn mans dann schauen möchte über was man abgestimmt hat oder welchen Stadtteil, fände ich noch super.

Auch die Symbole verwirren manchmal, da sieht man nicht immer genau, bekommt man mit der Aktion nun mehr Geld oder weniger, manche Symbole haben keine Beschreibung. 

Toll wäre es auch wenn man Verschiedene Politische Fraktionen Ausschalten könnte, oder aus dem Amt Eckeln/Abwählen/Auflösen

Das Spiel hat Potential, hoffe da kommt noch einiges an Dynamik rein, Kriege, Volkskrankheiten, Anschläge, Naturgewalten, Korruption, direkter Handel, von mir aus darf es auch im Jahr 3000 oder so auch in den Weltraum gehen, aber das ist Geschmackssache.

Der Anfang ist gut aber schwer, braucht eine Weile bis man den Dreh hat, danach muss man einfach aufpassen und darf nicht zu gierig zu sein.

Ich hoffe ich konnte ein wenig helfen, und einfach nicht zu gefrustet sein, man wird ien par mal Fett Failen , bevor es dann gut kommt :P",

但是从情感出发，我最终选择了好评。这个好评是给这款“政治模拟”游戏的。对比常见的模拟经营类游戏，城市帝国显然是很特殊的，其核心玩法在于平衡或者说控制议会，这种独特的视角是应该表扬的。
对于不适应本作或者说初次接触的玩家，我只有两个衷告。
第一，你的议题遭到议会反对时，请先思考/探索一下原因，而不是上手就去收买/威胁/乞求议员。诚然，作为一款政治模拟游戏，各党派都有自己不同的利益，但是同为市议员，每个人都是以“为了城市”为目标出发的。我想，最常见的可能就是初期你提议建设某个建筑，结果议会全体反对吧，仔细看看就会发现，建设费用会直接使城市负债，这种情况下，任何有良知的议员都是应该反对的。
第二，请加税。税收是城市建设的保障，特别是在没有中央拨款的年代更是如此。不必顾虑一般市民的感受，事实上，比起税收多少，市民们更加在意有没有警局/医院/学校/路灯/下水道/电气/剧院/马路等等等等。有了钱才能更好的建设城市，最终你会形成一套完美的滚雪球开市区模式。顺便一提，我在第四世代时，工商业税就已经常年超过50%了，各阶层人头税基本也是30%到50%（学生除外，因为学生是没有收入的）。",

In Urban Empire ist eine Mischung von Politik und City Builder. Leider ist keins der Konzepte gut. 

Der Politikpart des Spiel ist teilweise nur nervig. Abstimmungen und Partien agieren teilweise unlogisch und sicher geglaubte Abstimmungen gehen ohne Begründung verloren. Frustrierend ist allerdings das fehlende Feedback des Spiels. Habe ich einen Einfluss auf die Stadtrat Wahl ? Kann ich dafür sorgen, dass die Kommunisten oder die Konservativen die stärkste Fraktion stellen ? Eher nicht.
Das Politiksystem kann, zum Glück, sehr einfach umgangen werden. Es funktioniert über weite Strecken über Geld. Ist viel Geld da kann machen was man will. Ist wenig Geld da, darf man nichts machen. Hierbei ist es egal, ob eine Entscheidung sinnvoll oder sinnlos ist. 

Der City-Builder Teil des Spiel funktioniert über Bezirke. Dies ist relative clever gelöst. Als Bürgermeister lege ich einen Bezirk und die Nutzung (prozentual) fest. Mehr habe ich als Bürgermeister nicht zu entscheiden. Updates (z.B. bessere Straßen) oder Servicegebäude benötigen eine Abstimmung im Stadtrat (der schwache Politikpart) und sind sehr langwierig Jedes Gebäude, jedes Update (eines Bezirkes) muss extra abgestimmt werden…

Vom Schwierigkeitsgrad hat das Spiel einen sehr fordernden Anfang. Ist dieser Überstanden, kann das Spiel mit verbundenen Augen gespielt werden. Langzeitmotivation sieht anders aus…

Das Spiel hat ein interessantes Konzept. Leider wurde das Konzept schlecht umgesetzt.

就让我从“该产品的热门用户自定义标签”来说吧
1、策略/政治：策略性低下，而议会这个比较有创意的系统其实就是重复使（点）用（击）讨好、恳求、威胁、抓小辫子等选项，把议员往你这边拉，然后法案通过，大家一起（吃喝玩乐）鼓掌【仅限于无财政赤字的状况】，然而如果一旦出现赔钱的状况，各政党议员是断然不会支持你的法案的。
2、模拟 ：不知道在模拟个什么东西。
3、城市营造：不存在的，你只需要拉边框，调节工业住宅商业区的比例，然后选上基础设施（基础设施？不存在的）、道路密度，就可以直接自动生成一个行政区；所以到后期你会发现你的城市中每过几条街就有一个工业区（改建区域规划？一改就亏钱，所以不存在的）；另：城市建筑模型太少，会出现一条街的高楼都是一个模样、当然，同一个建筑模型有不同的颜色（笑）。
4、管理/经济：不存在的，经济系统一塌糊涂，基础设施建设是天价，进行一个行政区的基础设施建设常常需要好几个行政区的收入来进行支撑，因而会出现某一个区电灯水管燃气柏油马路全部铺设完毕而周围好几个区的基础设施仍然处在18世纪初的水平（连下水道都没有），所以最好的办法就是大家一起点起蜡烛在泥巴路上昂首挺胸踏着整齐的步伐进入21世纪。
5、角色扮演：你管这叫角色扮演？这也能叫角色扮演？



总结：破游戏1月21号发售至今，最新的更新是在1月27号，无话可说；百度“城市帝国”贴吧到现在只有748的关注，99%的帖子都是在分享/求破解版（就这游戏也还有人求破解版233）；优化辣鸡；总之，创意是好的，但是做出了一个辣鸡，夸张一点说这游戏把定价从112改成21.1还差不多，所以喜欢城建的各位还是省下这112块去买个都市天际线比较好。

31052116,english,2017.03.10 05:20,❌,✅,0.5834679604,15,"What I like:

(1) Interface - one of the easier ones to learn. (2) Tutorial - it could be more clear, but for the most part, it's straightforward if you're paying attention. (3) The general idea - as a long-time fan of the Tropico franchise, it was nice to see Kalypso trying something similar, yet new. (4) Politics - having to work the game's political system to stay in power and pass legislation requires cunning and strategy, making it easily the best part of the game next to building stuff.

What I don't like: 

(1) Game crashes - that speaks for itself, except to say they're mercifully infrequent. (2) Financial aspect - it seems the only way to increase revenue is to up the tax rate, putting your city at a 70% or higher rate by the end of the game. Income seems unaffected by population, and when switching a district to medium or high density, the revenue almost never outweighs the costs, regardless of the demand for new space, which is almost a new problem itself with how the zoning demand meters never seem consistent or accurate. (3) Slow - due to the issue with how finances run, progressing and upgrading the city go very slowly. I've completed several campaigns with different families, but I never once had the revenue to risk paying for high density. If there's a way to do it consistently without following a strict strategy, someone please tell me and I'll try it out and edit this review accordingly. Otherwise, there's something seriously wrong with the financial aspect of this game. Comparitively, (4) the political consequences always seem a bit too easy, and fixing it would not be a simple matter of making things harder. There should be more options to really make it the complex challenge the game suggests it is (more details within the available options also wouldn't hurt).

Bottom line: If the developers fixed zoning demand, political consequences and options, revenue/cost issues, and the crashes, it would be a much more playable/replayable game. Until then, I've played about as much as I'm interested in playing it, and at 15 hours of play, I can't say it's worth buying.","What I like:

I've tried again and again to find a way into this game, tried different strategies, and still never figured out what the exact effects of my actions are. For example: Supplying a district with electricity costs a ton of money (but not a power plant or anything like that), but it's simply not clear what positive effect this has on the district. While some are specified, the district grows and generates EXACTLY the same income if you leave out the electricity.

With Urban Empire and Grand Ages, I wasted almost 100 bucks on a studio that delivers absolutely terrible quality! I'm completely done with Kalypso, and Urban Empire is only recommended for ages 10 and under who enjoy clicking around..."

首先这个游戏有一个特色机制：议会。这个游戏不同于其他游戏你就是上帝想怎么弄就怎么弄，会有一个议会机制来阻挠约束你的每一项花费公款的行为。不论你是皇帝指派的钦差大臣，还是民选的市长，花财政的钱都需要经过议会投票，后期甚至当市长也需要每六年一次进行议会投票。但是这个议会机制形同虚设，在财政结余为正的时候议会一般不会阻止财政议案通过，而如果玩家后期的声望很好，说话分量大，可以通过多次拉票，威胁或者劝说议会通过自己的提案。
然后是节奏问题，玩一局的时间很长，我第一次通关玩了五六个小时，后期其实很枯燥，既没有战争也没有对手，完全就是是一个人在那搞建设、升级科技。如果说有什么难的地方那就是跟议会战斗。议会各种投票，要保证提案通过，要保住市长的位置也要拉票，如果省去议会机制，这个游戏就是个不好看的建房子游戏。

I paid $60 AUD for this as I bought it from a store, definitely about $40 too much, especially since when I installed it off the disc I had to essentially uninstall it and download it from Steam to get it to work.  If I'd bought it on Steam I'd have asked for a refund.  I should've put the money towards something else.  Next game from this publisher I think of buying I'll definitely test try first."

但是这速度也太慢了。。。就现在为止，游戏体验仍没多大改善。
这个游戏概念是很棒的，但实在是没有把想法完整的做出来。

说一下这个游戏欠缺，希望改进的地方，因为我也是第一次玩此类游戏，因此不会与其他类似作品横向比较：

一、家族角色的问题。

一个扮演某一个人物或某一世系的游戏想要耐玩，你得确保这个世系的人物每一代的形象有可塑性和意外性。但很显然，你用一些事件库里不多的选择对人物性格产生影响，想以此来体现这个可塑性、意外性，肯定是不够的。这样造成的结果就是一个家族最多开两个档，再玩就没意思了。影响游戏寿命。

我所能想到的方法就是，给城市的行政文化建一个类似于政治从极左到极右，从保守到开放这样的二维坐标，然后扩充事件库，让本代市长的所有的选择都对行政文化处在坐标轴的位置产生影响，而后代市长的人物特性，根据不同的文化走向会产生极大变动，对下一任市长的介绍词，也根据特性进行分句匹配。

二、城市的命运问题。

该游戏可能与我想的不太一样。我觉得这个游戏概念要做，完全可以做成多路线多结局。就是说，不像现在这样，每一局都是点到点，所有的系统都是为了走向全面开放民主而服务的。这样就好比你已经给玩家设定好了命运，让玩家根据这条路线走一遍而已，一点点玩法上的偏差，完全不能改变既定的发展趋势。

虽然从历史论上来说，着眼于长时段，整个世界确实是呈现着全面进步的趋势。但是很多时候进步并不是齐头并进的，而是以点带面的。

因此该游戏最好加强一下产业系统，让玩家可以通过经营城市某一个特定的产业，形成产业优势，进而形成独有的城市文化，让自己的城市有独特的特性，有独特的事件，独特的科技，虽然带动了其他领域的跟进发展，但一些其他领域的社会变革可能就无法触发，甚至可能引起倒退。这样有取舍，有进退，才有发展的真实性。

三、随机事件的问题

事件库太少啦！太少啦！太少啦！而且事件的触发至今看不出什么意外性，大至是根据时代和科技触发，最好让它受更多的因素的影响，而且要有选择的触发，一局内没有触发过的事件，也许下一局满足条件后就能触发，这样也能有所保留。不然我一局玩下来，第二局还是这些事件，就很没意思。

还有事件中做出的选择对城市造成的影响不够直观，城市的很多信息看似有很多面板统计，但还是让人没有一个整体把握。
可能是我玩的不够久的缘故，但我还是要说，作为一个市长，难道不应该一个面板对应一个管理问题吗？比如，我想知道某一个娱乐设施覆盖的范围加到最大，前后各覆盖范围内行政区的总体娱乐度产生了怎样的变化，面板上就完全看不出来。只能看到现在的娱乐度是多少，每个行政区的娱乐度是多少。这样完全解决不了问题，玩家也拿不出合理的改善方案（比如我城市的环境指数低，我造了两个公园，却只加了一点环境，这个数值是如何计算的，我需要看得出来）。

如果做不出相对动态的统计面板的话，至少像文明5的数值显示一样，我一个鼠标停在某一个数值上，他会给我显示所有影响这个数值的因素以及它们影响的值，这样一眼下来，就知道自己这些法案，这些设施究竟影响了哪些东西。而不是只在选择界面给玩家一个数值，告诉玩家一个二元论，好，和不好。玩家怎么来合理决策呢？决策之后也像是面对一个黑箱，知其发展而不知其何以发展。

四、私人资金和城市资金的问题。

强烈建议市长可以筹资！不同家族有不同筹资手段，比如做invited speak是有钱拿的，做企业的advisor（城市最好有不同领域的企业，并且随机命名），接受支持者赠与或者insider trading等等，这样个人的命运也可以和城市结合起来，让游戏更有纵深。

另外，现在的游戏系统，城市税收分类实在太少拉！不把工商业税调到吓死人，简直没法玩，把税种细分一下吧，我也不想一刀把税率都切到这么高，当然，也许是我玩的时间不长还太菜，这只是我的个人意见。

虽然想说的还有很多，说的也不一定对，但我没精力继续写了。希望游戏尽快更新，现在的这个版本不值这个价。

需要说明的是，期待值过高是我自己的问题，大家不要学坏。
赞的不是游戏体验，赞的是概念和想法。",

Schade um diese gute Spielidee.
Mich stört vorallem ein wichtiger Punkt und zwar das Geld und dessen Ausgewogenheit.
Leider ist man ständig irgendwie im Minus. Schon der kleinste Entschluss kann einem, trotz genauen überlegen, die Haushaltskasse sprengen. Einnahmen gehen für mich völlig unnachvollziehbar plötzlich ins Minus. So schnell kann man nicht handeln oder sich wieder erholen damit die Einnahmen erneut sprudeln.
Ist man im Minus blockiert der Stadtrat alles was man irgendnur möglich machen möchte damit die Stadt leben kann. Ab diesem Zeitpunkt kann man das Spiel vergessen. Es langweilt ab da nur noch weil man ohnehin weiß, dass man bestimmte oder gar alle Entscheidungen im Stadtrat nicht durchbekommt.

30389093,german,2017.02.08 15:18,❌,✅,0.6038709879,16,"Wie wir alle, wurde auch ich wohl von dem ungewöhnlichen Gameplay gelockt, das Urban Empire zu bieten haben soll und tatsächlich wurde ich nicht enttäuscht. Tatsächlich ist Urban Empire ein Aufbauspiel mit Geschichte. Wir müssen unser Dörfchen aus dem vorletzten Jahrhundert aufbauen und es bis in die Gegenwart führen. Uns erwarten viele Entscheidungen, die wir treffen müssen. Vor allem aber das Abstimmen der Parteien, für viele Schritte, die wir beschließen müssen ebenfalls durchlebt werden. Erst bei einer Mehrheit, können wir Gebäude genehmigen lassen, bis hin zu ganzen Stadtviertel. Viele Nebenevents halten die Stimmung aufrecht und ein ungewöhnlich großer Forschungsbaum lässt uns bis in die nahe Zukunft, Dinge erforschen, die unserer Bevölkerung und damit unserer Stadt guttun. Ein Städe-Aufbau-Simulator wie Cities Skylines aber mit mehr Tiefgang und realistischeren Gegebenheiten, in der wir als Bürgermeister eben nicht einfach drauf los bauen und Geld ausgeben können, sondern immerzu uns mit den Parteien gut stellen müssen und unsere Finanzen im Augen haben müssen. 

Das klingt alles sehr innovativ, geradezu genial und das ist es tatsächlich auch. Leider stecken aus meiner Sicht die Probleme ganz wo anderes und zwar das was unter der Haube sich befindet.

Trotz zugegeben kurzer Spielzeit, sind mir einige Dinge aufgefallen, die mich dazu veranlassen, keine Empfehlung auszusprechen. Zumindest als ich gestern mit jemanden über das Spiel redete, habe ich klar gesagt: „Die Mängel hat das Spiel. Damit musst du rechnen. Empfehlen kann ich es nicht aber schlussendlich ist es deine Entscheidung“ 
Doch woher kommt diese Nicht-Empfehlung?

Das erste was mir schon einen Dämpfer versetzt hat, sind sporadische Abstürze beim starten des Spiels. Natürlich ist das nun relativ. Bei jemand anderem läuft das Spiel vielleicht ohne Probleme aber die Absturz-Häufigkeit, wenn man sich umhört ist dann doch ein verbreitetes Phänomen, so das der Verdacht naheliegt, dass man diesen Kritikpunkt doch dem Spiel zuschreiben kann. Die Abstürze ereigneten sich meist beim Ladebildschrim, beim Spielstart oder beim Laden des Spielstands. Auch die wenigen Patches, die dazu kamen, änderten daran leider nichts. Zumindest nicht bei mir.

Das Nächste, was mir aufgefallen ist, war das Tutorial oder besser an einer Stelle, in der ich Plötzlich keine weiteren Informationen bekommen habe, was ich tun soll, weil ich aus versehen einen Schritt gemacht habe, der nicht vorgesehen war und damit ein Game-Break entstand. Das nagt am Elan, da man bereit ist, das Spiel zu lernen. Zudem wurde mir das System der Abstimmung bzw der Beeinflussung der Abstimmung, nicht nahe genug erläutert. Ich hatte gefühlt im Tutorial allgemein noch viele Fragezeichen über dem Kopf.

Die Grafik. Ja, wieder so etwas Subjektives aber für meinen Teil, spreche ich mich da dann doch dafür aus, das ich schon deutlich stimmungsvollere Aufbauspiele gespielt habe und ich spreche nicht von der Textur-Qualität z.B. sondern von der Lebendigkeit. Die Häuser und Straßenzüge sehen gut aus und sind hübsch texturiert, doch fällt einem schon nach kurzer Zeit auf, das irgendwas an der Spielwelt merkwürdig wirkt. Sie bewegt sich nicht wirklich. Die Lebendigkeit eines Dorfes oder einer ganzen Stadt fehlt. Die Leute die auf den Gehwegen laufen, Viel mehr Verkehr auf den Straßen, Baume die sich im Wind bewegen. Bürger die vielleicht zumindest dargestellte Tätigkeiten nach gehen. Mehr Details auf den Straßen und in der Umgebung fehlen. Gerade bei so einem Spiel, wäre ein Detailgrad eines Annos sehr stimmungsvoll gewesen. Alles im allem, haben wir eine schöne Welt, die aber irgendwie mehr ein starres Modell, als eine lebendige Stadt simuliert. 

Gerade da wäre noch zu erwähnen, das leider Events oder gewisse Gebäude oder Stadtviertel-Verbesserungen keinen Einfluss auf die Optik oder der Lebendigkeit haben. Es ist immer gleich viel los oder weniger, dem entspreche
n. 
Der Kamerawinkel ist auch leider nicht wirklich günstig und man sucht immerzu nach mehr Übersichtlichkeit. Zurück gezoomt reicht nicht aus, um einen guten Überblickt über die Stadt zu bekommen.

So gut das mit dem Realismus auch ist, mit dem Abstimmen usw, halte ich das System für zu wenig vertieft. Irgendwie wirkt mir das Ganze zu simpel. Auf der anderen Seite, finde ich persönlich es gar nicht so toll, bei jeder Aktion den Parteirat zu Rate ziehen zu müssen. Das ist etwas, was nicht so ganz bei der Beschreibung des Spiels durchklang. Tatsächlich macht mir dieses System, beim selber Spielen keinen Spaß und das hätte ich wirklich nicht gedacht. Vor allem bietet es keine wirkliche Abwechslung und man klickt mehr schon durch, als sich mit der Wahl auseinander zu setzten.

Zusammengefasst:
Urban Empire ist ein innovatives Spiel, das wirklich tolle Ansätze für ein Aufbauspiel oder Städte-Simulator mitbringt. Das Durchschreiten durch mehrere Epochen der Entwicklung finde ich interessant und könnte wirklich vielleicht in anderen Spielen als Ansatz weiter vertieft werden. Leider finde ich die Verzahnung, der viele innovativen Elemente, nicht gelungen und technische schwächen verdüstern das Bild zunehmend. Unter der Haube: Technisch schwächelt das Spiel mit sporadischen Abstürzen und deutlichen Fps-Einbrüche. Vom Design schwächelt das Spiel in der Lebendigkeit der Spielwelt und der merkwürdigen Kamera-Perspektive. Spielerisch bieten die innovativen Gameplay-Elemente zu wenig Abwechslung und lässt sich schnell durchschauen. Die Abstimmungen werden so mehr zu einer Last, als dass sie wirklich Spannung erzeugen.

Zum Ergebnisse komme ich damit, dass ich das Spiel nicht empfehlen kann, im Anbetracht dessen, dass der Preis viel zu hoch und die Leistung zu gering. Der hohe Preis wird dem Spiel nicht gerecht. Ich Empfehle dafür mehr auf einen Sale zu warten.

Politics as a new focus in a city builder/manager? Great! - I love city-simulators, played them for 20+ years...


I will refrain from listing any pros, as the cons far outweigh any pros and until fixed, I would strongly recommend your money to be spent elsewhere!

Summary:
Lack of control
Tedious and repetitive political mechanics
Abysmal performance issues
Waiting and frustration guaranteed - for the majority of the time.

Elaborating the cons:

1. Political part is tiresome and repetitive: 
Sadly the game is poorly executed, as every action requires a vote, however realistic that might be, it means that changes takes ages: All your city districts takes a vote to change, which quickly becomes tiresome and repetitive. Imagine you want to roll out electrical grids in your entire city, before you are done you will have spent 20 years tediously modifying a district, waiting on the vote and repeat. 
My recommendation:
Perhaps some unlockable ability that a mayor can modify within certain thresholds before it triggering a vote or a similar mechanic, or at least removing the constriction that only one ""modify district"" vote can be active at a time. Perhaps increase political interaction, such as more access to voting groups, ability to do campaigning (both for mayor elections and city council) and the ability to choose a political party, as well as interaction with other cities such as trade or infrastructural connections - not just the horrible ""twin cities"" mechanic that is currently the only inter-city interaction available. 

2. Info and theory crafting in this game is so bad it hurts: 
You can, if you look into city statistics get info about traffic congestion, but the consequences of traffic congestion are not apparent. Need for certain zoning such as industry or housing seems important but after 15+ hours I still havent worked out exactly hot to satisfy it, perhaps because changes happen so slow that I have moved on to trying alternatives before the initial attempts effects kick in. Similarly it is not clear what exactly the different citizen parameters do to the game, health, security and happiness etc. all seem important, but as long as they stay in the green they don’t have apparent modifiers to the city.. (?) I would love some percentages and modifiers show here and there.

3. Performance issues are by far the worst I have ever experienced: 

I just upgraded my graphics card, and even on lowest settings, speed 2 (out of 3 speed settings) still lagged - I spent about 10 hours on one play through, which was a pain. Granted, I maxed out my city size, but that should really not be an issue. If you want to avoid performance issues, try keeping your city at 1/4 of max size or so (Fun isn't it?).

4. Combined with the above, the lack of control and info and the bad performance, the game just becomes painfully boring and frustrating. The last 100 years of gameplay was, for me, just setting to the max speed and answering every vote that showed up until the game was over.","Great promises, but disappointing.

Der Grund dafür ist einfach : Langeweile 
Wie ich schon erwähnt habe ist die Idee gut leider aber schlecht umgesetzt.
Das durchbringen von Politischen ideen und Bezirksplanungen ist mit einer postivien bilanz so einfach das es nicht nötig ist überhaupt sein politisches Kapital bei den Parteien zu investieren (die Staaträte stimmen allem außnahmlos zu solange das man in grünen Bereich Finanzbereich ist).
Das macht das grundprinzip dieses Spiel leider herausforderungslos.
Was die Bilanz betrifft ist es leider kaum möglich ins Minus zurutschen.
Nach kurzer Spielzeit fand ich heraus das es am einfachsten ist einfach die ganze Karte in der ersten Epoche mit Bezirken zuzubauen (die Parteien winken es ohne einischen meiner seits sowieso durch). Was die schwierigkeit in den restlichen epochen leider komplett entfernt.Ich hoffen das in Zukunf durch patches oder DLCs (was leider wieder etwas Kostet) die schwierigkeit und dadurch der spass im spiel erhöht wird.

30092624,english,2017.01.22 08:22,❌,✅,0.7307329178,36,"Wonder why so many people hate this game? There's a long winding answer. 

Urban Empires was origonally marketed as having the following game play niches.

1) It it was a decent city-building strategy game. 
2) It had a political aspect: you would have to manipulate the political parties and make deals to pass key legislation. 
3) It would have a branching plot over multiple generations that would tell the story of both your family and the city. 
4) Your choices would effect how the story plays out.

And the game doesn't do ANY of these things well, at all. Many of people who bought this game felt that they were lied to about the type of game play

""Ok, so it doesn't meet it's promises. How did it fail? Why is it a bad game specifically?""

1) The Mechanics of the City Building Part are neither interesting nor challenging.

The city building is not difficult or interesting enough for hardcore strategy players.... once you figure out that you don't actually need to improve any aspect of your city. Just slap down districts and a couple schools for brainpower. Rely on institutions and edicts to raise stats. Maybe drop a school or PD department or two as you need it. That's it. You don't need to build anything else unless it's in the hard negatives.

The political management means very little other than ""you can't do unpopular things' with damned little (if any) way of making things unpopular/popular. it's not like you can forge alliances against other parties or try and play people off against one another, and even if you did, it's not like you have to for 99% of the edicts you could pass. 

Combined, this means that the game doesn't offer any interesting srategic challenge once you figure out the above. You'll figure out what you need to do, you'll do it, and there's no changes to that strategy and no challenges to it.


2) The User Experience is AWFUL

There are a ton of controls and fiddly bits of the district but you can safely ignore them most of the time. That's actually a good thing, becuase the tutorial and user interface are so opaque that I have no idea what the advatnage or costs are for doing anything (except my experience from playing the game that tells me that any given upgrade is probably not worth it) and it's not clear HOW to do anything, and when it is, you'll be marveling at how complicaed it is to do it.

Do you need to have residenital with your commercial zone to make it work? Maybe? It doesn't tell you. Commerical zones seem to populate when you build straight commercial districts, so I guess? Is this more or less effective than normal? Maybe?

Gas, electricity and water raise the efficency of companies in the district. How much? How much will it cost in maintenence? I dunno. Increasing roads reduces traffic, buying public transport increases ""transit points"". What do they do? I have no idea! There's like 30 seperate submenus for each district as well.

If this was something like a difficulty curve, it would be one thing, but a lot of these mechanics genuinely doesn't seem to matter at all. It's not just that these are hidden, opaque mechanics, they are hidden and useless mechanics, and they are the only things you can really do. For example, the bonuses from sister cities don't seem to do anything worth mentioning. It's just another tech that provides a tiny, pointless bonus that won't matter all that much. 

This makes the late game really, painful once you start unlocking stuff in age 2-3. Say you want to upgrade a district. You have to make all your changes in a single pass, because you can only alter one district at a time. This involves muliple submenus with a variety of options, a ton of optional buildings to place down, zoning sliders, and you doing this over 20-30 districts. Did I mention you can only change one district at a time because it requires a vote that takes 3 months to organize? 

This adds up to make the game REALLLLLy slow when it gets big. This is compounded by another issue...

2B) The game slows your PC to crawl in mid/late game

I don't mean micromanagement, I mean the game LITERALLY slows to a crawl, with no way to increase the rate beyond the barely adequate max speed from earlier eras. I was running max speed in era 3, and it was moving about as fast as 'normal' speed from era 1. Combined with the micromangement issues, playing the mid to late game becomes a tedious grind.

* Note - This was on early builds in 2017. It may have changed.


3) The Game has no story, narrative, and sucks at worldbuilding. 

The game sucks at telling a story, and does a poor job of making me feel like my character matters, my family matters, or the city matters. This wouldn't normally be a dealbreaker for a sandbox city sim, but Urban Empire was specifically marketed as gigantic, branching, multi-generational epic ranching story. And it just doesn't deliver anything close to that. 

The actual decision points are rare and far between, and decisions have little narrative impact. Even major historical events barely qualifying as an an afterthought or a newspaper article. 

Example:  Oh look, the empire has rebelled and is now a republic. Oh look, it's WWI. Oh look, it's WWII.  You don't interact with the other families or personalities in the city. You don't pick whether you side with the Axis or Allies. You don't have any big event trees to worry about. The only thing the choices seem to do is give you a few different character traits that mean very little. Woohoo?

The parties are hilariously random and fickle. I've had hard-right Christians support abortion, Communists deny worker rights, and Pacifists support violent nationalists. There's usually no reason or sense behind their decisions.

The whole thing ends up taking away any idea that the game takes place in a world that exists. I don't mind game mechanics breaking a narrative immersion or being unrealistic, but this level of failure represents a basic lack of effort on the part of the designers to deliver any kind of emotional impact to the game.

4) Nothing you do really matters. 

The main points combine to create a game that makes me feel that nothing I do has any meanigful impact. I had researched video games shortly after the 1900's, apparently somehow running in a city that had a power plant but no actual electrical grid. Nothing feels different about my city.

Nothing looks different at any point, the game doesn't really feel very different from Era 1 to Era 3 (as far as I got).  The story just sort of shows up as a multiple choice question that will affect a few character states, but I don't feel any sort of control over the narrative, nor does it in any way feel like a naturally evolving story with compelling characters (there aren't really any characters).

Fun Factor 

There are a lot of heavily flawed games that are actualy kind of fun (hell, this is why Kalypso is still in business), but this isn't one of them: the flaws aren't endearing, or even tolerable, and the game lacks any of the character that made games like Tropico fun.

To sum up:
There's no real story (despite that being a touted feature). 
The game's not immersive enough to suck you in. 
The game's not challenging enough to make you think about it very deeply for very long. 
There are no campaigns to finish beyond the first, and I couldn't even bring myself to do that, because the game had slowed itself to a crawl by the time I was hitting the modern era.

Verdict: This game was sold as an an city and political dynasty simulator, and ended up being a crappy city simulator and utterly failing to simulate the political or dynasty part.

I'd only buy this game at VERY deep discount (like $5, or in a Humble Bundle). There are tons of strategy games that are cheaper and better than this. Every aspect of the game is mediocre (at best) with no outstanding features I can see providing any real niche appeal.","Wonder why so many people hate this game? There's a long winding answer. 

Urban Empires was origonally marketed as having the following game play niches.

1) It it was a decent city-building strategy game. 
2) It had a political aspect: you would have to manipulate the political parties and make deals to pass key legislation. 
3) It would have a branching plot over multiple generations that would tell the story of both your family and the city. 
4) Your choices would effect how the story plays out.

And the game doesn't do ANY of these things well, at all. Many of people who bought this game felt that they were lied to about the type of game play

""Ok, so it doesn't meet it's promises. How did it fail? Why is it a bad game specifically?""

1) The Mechanics of the City Building Part are neither interesting nor challenging.

The city building is not difficult or interesting enough for hardcore strategy players.... once you figure out that you don't actually need to improve any aspect of your city. Just slap down districts and a couple schools for brainpower. Rely on institutions and edicts to raise stats. Maybe drop a school or PD department or two as you need it. That's it. You don't need to build anything else unless it's in the hard negatives.

The political management means very little other than ""you can't do unpopular things' with damned little (if any) way of making things unpopular/popular. it's not like you can forge alliances against other parties or try and play people off against one another, and even if you did, it's not like you have to for 99% of the edicts you could pass. 

Combined, this means that the game doesn't offer any interesting srategic challenge once you figure out the above. You'll figure out what you need to do, you'll do it, and there's no changes to that strategy and no challenges to it.


2) The User Experience is AWFUL

There are a ton of controls and fiddly bits of the district but you can safely ignore them most of the time. That's actually a good thing, becuase the tutorial and user interface are so opaque that I have no idea what the advatnage or costs are for doing anything (except my experience from playing the game that tells me that any given upgrade is probably not worth it) and it's not clear HOW to do anything, and when it is, you'll be marveling at how complicaed it is to do it.

Do you need to have residenital with your commercial zone to make it work? Maybe? It doesn't tell you. Commerical zones seem to populate when you build straight commercial districts, so I guess? Is this more or less effective than normal? Maybe?

Gas, electricity and water raise the efficency of companies in the district. How much? How much will it cost in maintenence? I dunno. Increasing roads reduces traffic, buying public transport increases ""transit points"". What do they do? I have no idea! There's like 30 seperate submenus for each district as well.

If this was something like a difficulty curve, it would be one thing, but a lot of these mechanics genuinely doesn't seem to matter at all. It's not just that these are hidden, opaque mechanics, they are hidden and useless mechanics, and they are the only things you can really do. For example, the bonuses from sister cities don't seem to do anything worth mentioning. It's just another tech that provides a tiny, pointless bonus that won't matter all that much. 

This makes the late game really, painful once you start unlocking stuff in age 2-3. Say you want to upgrade a district. You have to make all your changes in a single pass, because you can only alter one district at a time. This involves muliple submenus with a variety of options, a ton of optional buildings to place down, zoning sliders, and you doing this over 20-30 districts. Did I mention you can only change one district at a time because it requires a vote that takes 3 months to organize? 

This adds up to make the game REALLLLLy slow when it gets big. This is compounded by another issue...

2B) The game slows your PC to crawl in mid/late game

I don't mean micromanagement, I mean the game LITERALLY slows to a crawl, with no way to increase the rate beyond the barely adequate max speed from earlier eras. I was running max speed in era 3, and it was moving about as fast as 'normal' speed from era 1. Combined with the micromangement issues, playing the mid to late game becomes a tedious grind.

* Note - This was on early builds in 2017. It may have changed.


3) The Game has no story, narrative, and sucks at worldbuilding. 

The game sucks at telling a story, and does a poor job of making me feel like my character matters, my family matters, or the city matters. This wouldn't normally be a dealbreaker for a sandbox city sim, but Urban Empire was specifically marketed as gigantic, branching, multi-generational epic ranching story. And it just doesn't deliver anything close to that. 

The actual decision points are rare and far between, and decisions have little narrative impact. Even major historical events barely qualifying as an an afterthought or a newspaper article. 

Example:  Oh look, the empire has rebelled and is now a republic. Oh look, it's WWI. Oh look, it's WWII.  You don't interact with the other families or personalities in the city.

※현재 스팀에 이름이 Urban Empire - KR로 업데이트 된 것으로 보아서는 스팀도 한글화가 적용될 가능성이 있습니다만 확실하진 않네요.
※주의 - 이 게임은 다이렉트 게임즈를 통해 구입해야지만 한글이 가능합니다. 스팀에서 구입시 한글 이용이 불가능하니 참고하세요.


 거두절미하고 한마디로 요약하자면 ""시도는 좋았다""라고 할 수 있습니다.

 이 게임은 도시 경영 보다는 정당들의 관계를 조율하고, 지지도를 올리고, 투표를 통해 의사를 결정하는 정치 요소를 주력 컨텐츠로 잡고 있습니다. 하지만 문제점은 그 주력 컨텐츠조차 별로 할게 없으며 완성도가 떨어진다는 점입니다. 일단 제가 이 게임을 잡은지 3시간 만에 모든 컨텐츠를 다 소모했습니다. 그러고도 ""이왕 샀으니 어떻게든 좋은 점을 찾아보자....."" 라고 해서 억지로 억지로 붙잡고 플레이한게 22시간입니다.

 정치 컨텐츠라고 해도 1.투표를 할 안건을 결정하는 것 2.정당에게 지속적인 압력을 넣어서 안건에 대해 찬성 혹은 반대표를 던지게 하는 것 두가지가 전부입니다. 게다가 버그인지 의도된 점인지는 모르겠지만, 게임을 진행해보면 플레이어는 분명 진보성향의 가문을 선택했는데, 정작 게임 내에서는 거의 무조건적으로 보수성향의 정당의 지지를 받고 진보 성향의 정당의 견제를 받습니다. 분명히 시장에 대한 정당의 지지도가 높다고 나오는데, 시장 선거에 들어가면 반대표를 던지는 모습을 볼 수 있습니다.

 물론 투표를 통해 무언가를 결정한다는 요소는 매우 참신합니다. 하지만 게임에 익숙해지면 투표라는 컨텐츠 자체가 매우 번거로워집니다. 난이도를 올리고 플레이어를 번거롭게 하기 때문이 아닌, 투표를 하기 위해 일일히 시의회를 클릭하고 ""투표 시작""을 눌러서 표가 집계되기를 기다리고, 결과가 나오면 확인을 일일이 눌러주고 다시 시의회 창을 다고 도시 화면으로 돌아가서 경영을 하는 과정이 매우 귀찮고 시간을 잡아먹기 짝이 없습니다. 시장 투표를 제외한 정치요소는 실패한다고 해서 리스크가 있는 것도 아니라서 게임이 매우 늘어지고 지루해지는 요소가 됩니다.

 비슷한 요소를 가진 게임인 크루세이더 킹즈 2의 경우 어떤 법안을 통과 시키기 위해 유권자들에게 선물 공세를 펼치거나, 감금이나 협박을 하거나, 선거권을 박탈시키거나, 체포나 암살을 통해 제거하는 등 여러가지 방법을 쓸 수 있으며 정적들이 플레이어의 대처에 따라서 아군이 되기도 하고 플레이어를 막아서는 위협적인 적이 되기도 하는 등 역동적인 정치 시스템을 가진 것과 크게 비교되는 점입니다.

 두번째 문제점은, 그리고 가장 큰 문제점이기도 한 점은, 도시 경영 요소가 부실하기 짝이 없으며 제대로 된 감수를 거치지 않았다는 점입니다. 특히나 경제요소의 균형이 전혀 맞지 않습니다. 이 게임의 사회기반 시설들은 단기적으로나 장기적으로나 투자비용 대비 이익이 극단적으로 떨어집니다. 

 예를 들어 심시티의 경우에는 어떤 지역의 교통 인프라가 한계에 도달할 경우, 시민들의 출퇴근에 지장이 생겨 시민들이 해당 지역에 거주하는 것을 꺼리게 됩니다. 따라서 해당 지역을 발전시키기 위해서는 교통 인프라를 반드시 발전시켜줘야 합니다. 그리고 교통 인프라에 2400달러를 투자하면 해당 지역이 그만큼 발전해서 투자한 만큼 본전을 뽑을 수 있는 식으로 디자인이 되어있습니다. 그리고 이렇게 도시 경영으로 얻어낸 이득은 다시 도시 경영에 사용하는 식으로 구성되어있죠.

 반면 어반 엠파이어의 경우, 어떤 지역의 도시 기반 시설의 수용량이 한계에 도달해도 해당 지역의 발전에 전혀 영향을 끼치지 않습니다. 반대로는, 도시 기반 시설을 철저하게 갖춰도 발전에 전혀 도움이 되지 않습니다. 도로, 버스, 지하철, 전기, 수로 등의 요소의 유지비가 적게는 1만에서 많게는 4만까지 들어가는데 비해 거기서 얻을 수 있는 이익은 10%도 되지 않습니다. 법원, 대학, 발전소, 항구, 종합병원, 학교 등의 공공시설도 마찬가지 입니다. 그렇다고 전혀 안지을 수는 없기 때문에 거기서 발생하는 90%의 손해는 시민의 고혈을 쥐어짠 높은 세금으로 땜빵할 수 밖에 없습니다.

 높은 세금은 도시의 경제를 침체시키고, 적자를 벗어나기 위해 어쩔 수 없이 긴축정책을 펼치게 되면 당연히 지루하고 재미없기 짝이 없습니다. 4배속을 눌러놓고 빨간색 숫자들이 초록색으로 바뀌는걸 몇시간이고 멍하니 바라보는 것에서 재미를 느끼는 사람들이 대체 얼마나 될까요?

 마지막으로는 게임이 UI 등에서 세세하게 불친절합니다. 일단 도움말이 없습니다. 튜토리얼은 부실하기 짝이없고, 게임 가이드도 없어요. 홈페이지를 들어가봐도 ""어반 엠파이어는 존나 짱짱맨 게임입니다. 어반 엠파이어를 지르십시오."" 라는 과대포장 광고 밖에 없구요. 단축키가 없어서 불편한 UI는 덤입니다. 심시티는 저밀도 구역을 중밀도 구역으로 바꿔주면 지어진 건물들이 자동으로 재건축 되는데, 이 게임은 그런게 없습니다. 저밀도를 중밀도로 바꿔주고 중밀도를 고밀도로 바꿔줄때마다 건물들을 한채한채 일일히 선택해서 부셔줘야합니다. 건물을 부수는 것도 드래그를 통해 여럿을 지정할 수가 없어서 무조건 하나하나 선택해야하지요. 어떤 드라마의 ""한땀한땀""이라는 대사가 생각나더군요. 공공시설의 범위를 확인하는 것도 세세하게 불편하고, 범위가 겹치는 나중이 되면 눈이 아플 정도입니다.

 이런점이 하루 이틀 이야기 되는 것도 아닌데 개발자들은 대체 뭘하고 있는지, 아니면 게임을 완전히 손을 놓은건지 엉뚱한 답변만 하고 있습니다. 패치 되는 부분도 별거 없어요.

 정치 게임을 원하신다면 크루세이더 킹즈 2를 사고, 도시 경영을 원하신다면 심시티나 시티즈 : 스카이라인이라는 넘사벽이 있습니다. 나는 반드시 민주주의 체제에서 정치를 해야겠다고 하면 크루세이더 킹즈 2의 리퍼블릭 DLC를 사면 됩니다. DLC가 싫다면 데모크라시 3이라는 게임도 있어요. 가급적 이 게임은 사지말라고 하고 싶네요. 이미 사서 반품도 안되고 게임은 너무 어려워서 어쩔 수 없는 분들은 제가 쓴 커뮤니티 가이드가 있으니까 잠깐 확인 해보시기 바랍니다.

 개인적으로는 이 게임을 평가하자면 10점 만점에 3점을 주고 싶습니다.",

Tuntui mukavalle, kun ajattelin että saan kaupungin johtajana puuttua jopa lakeihin jotka katson olevan hyväksi kaupunkilaisille ja yhteiskunnalle yleensä, ja samalla estää yhteiskuntaa ja muun muassa moraalia tai taloutta tuhoavia lakeja astumasta voimaan. 


Pettymys oli iso kun edes viemäriputkia, puhumattakaan sähköistä, ei asenneta jos valtuusto niin päättää. Eli sinut tullaan jyräämään totaalisesti.
Jos kerran realismia haetaan, niin eikö riittäisi että yksi päätös kattaa myös tulevat kaupunginosat. Tuskin esimerkiksi kotikaupungissani Espoossa valtuusto estää että uudelle asuinalueelle ei sitten vedetä viemäreitä tai sähköjä!
Sähköt pitäisi sähkölaitoksen hoitaa ja vesilaitoksen viemäri/hanaveden. Periaatteessa sähköille ja vesille pitäisi riittää että valtuusto antaa hommalle luvan sen ensimmäisen kerran kun sähköt ja viemärit jne. keksitään.
Sähkö- ja vesilaitokset tuovat kuntiin/kaupunkeihin lisätuloja, mutta tässä pelissä kaupunki maksaa sähköistykset ja jopa kuukausittain sähköistä!  

Jos ajattelet että tässä on pelaamisen vapautta, ja voit ottaa itsellesi diktaattorin roolin ja rakentaa sellaisen kaupungin ja sellaiset arvot kuin haluat, jotta kaupungista tulee sinun näköisesi, niin valitettavasti tulet pettymään. 

Otin pelin jo pois tietokoneesta kovalevyn tilaa kuluttamasta, mutta jos kuulen että tulevat päivitykset oleellisesti parantavat tätä peliä, niin voin antaa tälle pelille uuden mahdollisuuden.

Und damit fängt es an das das Spiel dumm ist, keinen Spass macht, und eigentlich einem keine kreative Freiheit lässt. Das dieses Spiel mehr auf Politik ausgelegt ist als auf die Grafik aktzeptiere ich sicherlich, auch wenn die Grafik Fehler beinhaltet, aber egal. Was ich allerdings nicht aktzeptiere ist die Tatsache das ich gezwungen werde wie ein Grüner oder Linker zu denken. Ich darf nicht irgendwelche Fantasien spielen. Das Spiel zwingt mich in die grüne oder rote Ecke. Ich muss also Punkte abarbeiten und habe eigentlich keine grossen Freiheiten. Dann kommt noch das beste von allem dazu. Das Spiel kommt als Alpha heraus und Patche kennt man nicht. Ich kenne Spiele die es wirklich übertreiben wo fast täglich Patches raus kommen (ARK), aber hier passiert überhaupt nichts, Geld eingesackt und leckt mich. Kalypso hat jetzt einen weiteren zufriedenen Kunden der mit Sicherheit niemehr von Euch was kaufen wird. Ihr habts vergeigt, so einfach ist das. Ich empfehle dieses Spiel nur zu kaufen wenn man es zu einen Preis von 4,99€ bekommt, alles dadrüber ist zuviel.",

worse than No Man's Sky

Urban empire 有城市规划,行政法令管理，议会斗争等诸多要素，但是都没有挖掘出应有的深度

对于喜欢城市规划的，可以买 cities:skyline
对于喜欢法令和道具抉择的， 我建议大家关注Frostpunk 

【《这是我的战争》开发商新作Frostpunk 新截图欣赏】玩家作为城市的统治者，需要作出各种各样的决定，比如图1中所示，当童工受伤，玩家可以选择不顾他们死活、继续工作，或者让童工做安全的工作，或是解雇这些童工。游戏中将有各项法案可供选择（如图2的 Sustain Life :我们不能治愈重大疾病，但我们至少能保证他们还活着。我们不会在病人身上实验药品），这些都会影响民众的不满值和希望值。游戏预计也将包含建造系统（图5），如何合理分配资源又将是一大难题，按照《这是我的战争》的惯例，估计资源会非常紧缺。

To the company that makes this game, I'd say please do not be dismayed. The direction you are going in makes sense and does actually produce a fun game. It is unfortunate that so many people here don't enjoy it but I think that largely is because they were expecting something else entirely.

THIS GAME absolutely does NOT DESERVE the RED LETTERS OF AWFUL RATING you're seeing. First thing first. Also, YOU'RE RIGHT. CAPSLOCK FOREVER. ANYWAY...

I can't believe this game got a negative review because a bunch of complete fucking gamer morons couldn't handle the fact this had some lightweight parliamentary mechanics built into.

So return it you unbelievable fucking whiners. That's not the right way to whine about stuff at all! Watch me next time! 

Nah, but it's a great game. It does something not nearly enough devs are trying to do which is government and political simulation. Nationstate, larger and smaller. I am so incredibly driven nigh on fucking mad because for the longest I've had a fairly detailed idea the creation of just such a game. Of course, I know the fine nuance of game development like I do higher math(sz). Wa wait no rather, like I DON'T HAVE A GOODAMN CLUE ABOUT anything in excess of basic bitachi wee-pre-algebra and multiple attempts to learn further have rendered hella bust so.... Ok well anyway the point is how it is maddening to have an idea that I can tell has something to it unlike a lot of the shovelware i see on steam lately and to not be able to get it out of my damn head. Like how can that ego of mine fit out here in the wild but wee ol very special project can't? Reality is a fucking rhino-cock choker for change man.

It's a good game. Ah, this one for the review or whatever I mean. Mine too but well just cue a frustrated intermittent volume increase of cursing for the next few moments.... and try this one.

I promise if congress/parliamentary mechanics determining a lot of stuff you can and cant do sounds like it has the potential to make things interesting, get this.  What a shame people couldn't love it proper.

Christ, someone does something new and they catch all this fucking shit for it and well gee why is originality so hard to come by? Well that kinda attitude definitely factors. Not you personally, but that attitude, amplified, en masse towards things that take something typical and make it fresh.

Man, where do I even begin with this game?

I wanted to love it so much after watching Youtube videos and playthroughs; this game looked amazing after watching several hours of them. Sadly, I don't think I've ever been burned as hard as I have been with this game more than any other game I've ever preordered in my entire life, including Spore. Yes. Including Spore.  I've tried to give this game some breaks, but...

Let's bulletpoint this.

1: Any resolution other than your native monitor resolution and the game will dull the colors immensely. Also, forget trying to play this game at anything above 1080p, because you'll get graphical errors that make all of your buildings white and blue. Also, kiss any framerate stability out the window, despite owning a GTX 1080. It's been three weeks since release, and no fix. Unexcuseable.

2. You feel like you have no control over anything, that everything you do doesn't matter, and by the end, you stop caring. You can see there's this whole economy ticking behind your industries and businessess, but you can't decide to help paper or barbershops directly or anything of the sort. You just place huge districts down and hope things work out. City council edicts are just passive boosts to your entire city that you just idly click on to make things easier.

3. I really must stress the lack of control. What does heavy traffic do to harm your city? Don't know, because unlike Cities Skylines it just gives you vague 'maximum traffic usage' numbers. How does it damage my economy? What can I do to make lumber or movies a better industry in my town? No idea! A lot of the time you're just waiting months to do minor adjustments to districts for... boredoms sake?

4. Your city looks boring as heck. Roads? All grids. Industries? I guess film industries, car factories, and lumber mills all look the same and I just didn't know about it. Don't you remember when film studios had smoke stacks? I sure don't! So forget having any major control on how your city looks, or putting it on a hill, or anything of the sort. It's just flat land. Remember Germany being flat? Guess we're in the Netherlands now.

You know, I could go on, and on, and on.

I wouldn't recommend this game, even if it went on sale from 40 dollars to 5 dollars. It just feels... like some major spark is missing. Cities Skylines absolutely destroys this game, and still stands as the best city builder to date. Go get that, and like two hundred mods, and watch a day pass by. Oh, and they aren't even sure this game will get modshop support now. Heck, Tropico 5 is still an excellent choice for those who want something more local and flavorful. To me, I should have bought the new Skyrim instead of this. This is literally, the biggest disappoint in gaming in years to me. I wanted to love this game... but I can't. The concept screamed epic, the execution... souless.

Updated this review 2/14/17, since a lot of you liked it, apperently.","2/22 edit: The image of this game sums it up. ""See all these buildings? That's what Cities: Skyline's has. As for me? Ehh..."" He's doing some sort of given up expression. It sums up my thoughts on this game entirely.

Man, where do I even begin with this game?

I wanted to love it so much after watching Youtube videos and playthroughs; this game looked amazing after watching several hours of them. Sadly, I don't think I've ever been burned as hard as I have been with this game more than any other game I've ever preordered in my entire life, including Spore. Yes. Including Spore.  I've tried to give this game some breaks, but...

Let's bulletpoint this.

1: Any resolution other than your native monitor resolution and the game will dull the colors immensely. Also, forget trying to play this game at anything above 1080p, because you'll get graphical errors that make all of your buildings white and blue. Also, kiss any framerate stability out the window, despite owning a GTX 1080. It's been three weeks since release, and no fix. Unexcuseable.

2. You feel like you have no control over anything, that everything you do doesn't matter, and by the end, you stop caring. You can see there's this whole economy ticking behind your industries and businessess, but you can't decide to help paper or barbershops directly or anything of the sort. You just place huge districts down and hope things work out. City council edicts are just passive boosts to your entire city that you just idly click on to make things easier.

3. I really must stress the lack of control. What does heavy traffic do to harm your city? Don't know, because unlike Cities Skylines it just gives you vague 'maximum traffic usage' numbers. How does it damage my economy? What can I do to make lumber or movies a better industry in my town? No idea! A lot of the time you're just waiting months to do minor adjustments to districts for... boredoms sake?

4. Your city looks boring as heck. Roads? All grids. Industries? I guess film industries, car factories, and lumber mills all look the same and I just didn't know about it. Don't you remember when film studios had smoke stacks? I sure don't! So forget having any major control on how your city looks, or putting it on a hill, or anything of the sort. It's just flat land. Remember Germany being flat? Guess we're in the Netherlands now.

You know, I could go on, and on, and on. About how the music repeats every ten minutes; how you really have to zoom in on max settings to even see people walk about; how despite the cool as heck technology tree is broken because you can be 30, 40, 50 years ahead of modern tech if you abuse it. This game made me not care about my city, what I was doing, and why I was doing it. That's the nail in the coffin for any simulator. I just don't see anything they could do to fix this game.

Hace años que pensé en la idea de tener un Simcity donde antes de poder colocar las nuevas calles tuvieras que someter el proyecto a la aprobación del ayuntamiento, por eso la idea, por fin, me pareció fantástica. Poco después me llevé cierta desilusión cuando descubrí que las posibilidades que nos iba a ofrecer el juego sobre el diseño de nuestra ciudad iban a ser prácticamente nulas, pero las semanas de espera siguieron avanzando y poco a poco iban llegando otras noticias que no pintaban nada bien, el juego no iba a estar en español, volvían a insistir en el fallido y erróneo planteamiento de las eras, el protagonista sería nuevamente un personaje perteneciente a una saga familiar. En fin, ciertos desaciertos nada esperanzadores. 

Pasaron las semanas y llegó el estreno del juego. Se confirmaron las faltas que ya conocimos y se evidenciaron algunas nuevas. El juego es excesivamente cerrado, te guía por la historia que te ofrece y no te deja margen de maniobra (casi llega a volverse monótono). La genial idea de que tú seas un alcalde ajeno al sistema de partidos políticos no tiene sentido ni correspondencia con la realidad, los alcaldes reales pertenecen a un partido político y ganan elecciones y otras veces las pierden y tienen que estar en la oposición. 

En el apartado técnico, respecto a la jugabilidad, un sistema de cámara que es un desastre, tiene una enorme sensibilidad (aunque lo pongas al mínimo) y la camara se mueve para todos lados.

Para terminar (ya por soñar), a poco que se hubieran esforzado un poquito más podrían haberle añadido un workshop donde hubiésemos podido añadir nuestros propios mapas, nuestros propios personajes o incluso nuestras propias propuestas políticas.

Aún así, a pesar de todo, por la originalidad del concepto y porque soy un fanático del género, aunque muy tímidamente, recomiendo la compra de este juego. Eso sí, si no sois unos fanáticos como yo, esperaos a alguna oferta.",

Developing technology and investing in infrastructure won't even make the city richer; it only increases your expenses. If you run into a deficit, the parliament won't raise taxes, and the citizens' money will dwindle. All you've previously invested in benefits and infrastructure will be wasted—you can only watch and wait for death. The gameplay is abysmal! There's absolutely no control required! You simply raise taxes, mindlessly buy land, and then stare blankly at the screen, because any action you find interesting or feasible will likely result in failure. You just watch. Every scene and every mayor is boring, because no matter which scene or mayor you choose, you just stare blankly. Besides the different map shapes, different news reports, and different party names in parliament, there's nothing special and no strategy.

In this regard the game delivered on this expectation very well. Urban Empire is aimed at the political side of managing a city and hence it allows you to be the mayor and relieves you of the burden of also being the town engineer, subcontractor, and surveyor. This is a big plus for me and I enjoy how easy it is to build new districts and have control of the contruction of the city without being bothered by many small details.

However, I cannot recommend this game primarily for three reasons:

Firstly, most of the edicts, proposals, and laws that are voted on by the City Council are rather one sided. With rare exception, most of the laws/edicts only have good benefits for your city and no negative consequences (sometime not even with any monetary expense either). The edicts that do have a negative consequences often are very minimal negative effects and are greatly outweighted by the positive effects. 

This leads to the political gameplay feeling very linear: Its like you are an omniscient mayor who knows that all of your ideas are great and they will all have good outcomes and your task is simply to get these nitwits on the city council to realize how good all these edicts and laws are for everyone and vote for them. I find that this leaves the feeling that the gameplay and strategic element is lacking. I would much rather have stronger positives and negatives for each edict. This will greatly improve this aspect of our city but it will also cause equally big problems in this other regard. I think it would also lead to the city feeling more specialized and have a uniqueness to it from one playthrough to the next.

Secondly, this games lacks a good guide to the numbers behind the game and understanding why money or happiness is climbing or falling is often not clear and so making strategic decisions becomes frustrating because unseen variables appear to be affecting your city in unpredictable ways.

Thirdly, you lose goodwill with politcal parties most anytime you encourage or cajole or persuade them how to vote on a particular issue. But apart from some random events, there isn't any consistent way to gain their goodwill. So when your goodwill is low, the only solution is to just talking to the parties until the goodwill rises back up to a normal level. My problem with this is that it ignores the whole deal-making and compromising side of politics. While its true political parties often become strongly divided from each and will not have much goodwill for the other party. At other times two rather different parties will come to an agreement to work together towards some mutual goal and will build up mutual goodwill to build up a stronger political bloc. If this game had some element of negotiating between parties or building up goodwill through consessions and compromise, then it would feel like an accurate political simulation.

Overall, Urban Empire successfully delivers a macro-level city building experience free of all the messy and frustrating detail work that most other city builders require. Unfortunately, the onesidedness of most of the edicts and laws as well as the inablility to cooperate and build up goodwill with political parties makes the game feel scripted and most cities feel the same as the last city you built.","I was very excited about this game coming out since it seemed to take away my least favorite part of City-Builder gameplay: laying down every single street and water pipe and powerlines etc...

印象中以政治为卖点的模拟经营游戏不多，也就玩过democracy3，但那个游戏的系统还是略简单了些，初期咬牙花坚持有利于经济发展+提升好感的政策，熬过财政亏损期，时间一长经济有起色后就没事了。而像本游戏一样，把政治影响直观直接体现到建造城市过程中的，应该还是第一次。

城市帝国的最大特点是跳出了旧式游戏（如老牌Simcity、新贵CitiesSkylines）的模式，玩家对城市的影响更加“间接”了，我们不再像以往的城市建设类游戏中那样可以为所欲为，在这里即使想新规划一片区域，或者通过一条法律都必须开会投票表决。习惯了做上帝，做一回真实的小市长也挺有意思的。

本游戏的框架搭得很大，又是家族又是时代，背景非常厚重。不过玩下来感觉游戏内容特别是细节，完全对不起这个框架，像是小学生抱着一本专业工具书在那里装逼……

作为卖点的政治系统依然很简单，政党都是一群头脑简单的白痴，影响投票的因素过少，说白了只要和他们关系好什么都能搞定，搞不定了咱还可以威胁那群怂包……

然后经济系统也很奇葩，我们只有收税这一项收入，但是要应对天文数字般的支出。公共设施的维护费很高，随便造一个就有可能导致赤字，而这些建筑的作用仅仅是满足市民的满意度而已。

科研系统还算有点意思，解锁科技树能给人新鲜感，不过研究解锁的法律和建筑依然只能对应贱民们的满意度，意义不大。

总体来说对这个游戏不满意，完全未达到之前宣传时我对它的期待。那么出色的题材和背景，如果好好做的话完全有成为神作的潜质，然而目前看起来制作过于粗糙了。不知道他们会不会慢慢填坑，不过按照我对Kalypso尿性的了解，成为DLC地狱的可能性更大……",

如果是，我希望如此。
最后一句话：你想做个铁腕政治家用政治作为武器，还是相当一个体恤民意，名垂青史令人纪念的人呢？I Want You，加入城市帝国，创造出无限种可能吧！
（以上见解全属个人意见，仅代表我个人立场）","The game's theme is novel, breaking with the typical city-building genre by incorporating politics. I feel like it's a lot like a book, with our mayor as the protagonist. We can manipulate political parties to adjust taxes, suppress them, and bring unbearable hardship to the people, thereby increasing our own income and funding the city's development. Alternatively, we can be a good mayor who cares for the people, lowering taxes to improve people's well-being and boost party support, but the city's development will lag behind. In politics, there's no such thing as absolute trust, fairness, or justice; only the impact we leave on future generations. I support the gameplay of this game. While I'm not particularly hopeful about the graphics, I can only say it's pretty standard. Our K-Shop has broken with the traditional city-building game formula and set a new precedent, which I find truly commendable. Perhaps the landscape of city-building games will change from now on.
If so, I hope so.
Finally, do you want to be a strong-arm politician using politics as a weapon, or someone who cares about public opinion and leaves a lasting legacy? I want you to join the Urban Empire and create endless possibilities!

Ici contrairement à Sim city ou City Skyline, chaque décision (décret, construction, ...) doit être avalisé par le conseil municipale où divers sensibilités politiques se cotoient (gauche, droite, communistes, extrêmes droite, ecologistes, chretiens-démocrates, ...).

Vous pouvez les supplier, exiger, menacer ou encore les faire chanter pour faire passer vos votes.

Le jeu dispose également d'un arbre technologique qui débute à la révolution industrielle pour vous emmener jusqu'au 21e siècle.

- Aucun bug ni plantage
- Arbre technologique qui s'inspire de Civilization
- Le concept de simulation politique couplé à un city builder
- La campagne qui fait office de bac à sable
- Il se passe toujours quelque chose (recherche débloquée, vote, evenement aléatoire)

Points faibles :
- Peu de différences notables entre les 4 familles / factions à disposition
- Le manque de profondeur en terme de gameplay, ce qui nuit à la rajouabilité

It really is a city builder game with a very awkward ""Do not pass go"" Council screen passing for the difference between Builder and Ruler. Ultimately it starts getting in the way. It needs to be streamlined to be less offensive to the continuing gameplay.

Then there's the mechanics of how and why your city grows or doesn't grow. Very few of the factors are fully explained to the point where you can comprehend them and utilise or react to them properly. A very slight change to your city perhaps even a change to just the city's potential and not even to it's physical nature (e.g. upgrade a district to potentially have higher density buildings) and suddenly everyone might move out sending you into a debt spiral you can never recover from.

Then there are story-driven decisions you have to make (will you the Major endorse X or Y etc). Some of them reveal their consequences in terms of modifications to various stats and some of them don't. There appears to be no rhyme or reason for the latter.

The game is also pretty poor on the graphical front. Ignore the lovely close-ups in the trailers. You'll never be looking at your city like that and even if you do take a moment to zoom in it really isn't impressive in the flesh. As your city grows so does your frame-rate slow. Even on a massively overclocked i7 and watercooled 1080GTX it tanks completely as the city gets larger. Eventually it crashes raising the ghost of a possible memory leak.

Cities Skylines trifft Democracy 3 - das jedenfalls habe ich von Urban Empire erwartet.
Im Ansatz wird auch beides, Politik und Städtebau, nachvollziehbar und clever miteinander verbunden indem man in kaiserlichem Auftrag eine Stadt gründen darf. 
Das passiert zu Beginn des 19. Jahrhunderts und erstreckt sich bis ins Jahr 2020. Auf Wunsch kann man weiterspielen allerdings ohne Neuerung durch Fortschritt und Entwicklung.

besonders gefallen hat mir:

- 4 unterschiedliche Familien mit anderen Startparametern
- gut übersetzte Dialoge
- angenehme Soundkulisse (kein Meisterwerk aber sie stört nicht)
- großer Technologi♥♥♥♥♥
- Szenarien Modus als Ergänzung zur Kampagne
- hilfreiches Tutorial ( ja - das ist leider nicht mehr selbstverständlich *No Man´s Sky* **hust**) 

weniger gefallen hat mir:

- Inkonsistentes Parteiensystem (eventuell verstehe ich es auch einfach nicht)
- schwache technische Präsentation besonders im späten Spielverlauf
- Familien (-dynastien) bleiben blass, haben keine Tiefe
- Parteien bleiben blass (keine Kandidaten, Programme etc)
- z.B. kein Familienstammbaum, Errungenschaften der Vorgänger usw.
- gelegentlich verwirrende Benutzerführung, unter anderem das starre negativ (rot) und positiv (grün) Prinzip
- keine Möglichkeit Anträge nachzubessern oder anzupassen.
- kein erkennbarer bzw. nachvollziehbarer Bezug zur Weltpolitik - ja alles wird erwähnt. Spürbaren Einfluss (ausser Wirtschaftskrisen) haben diese Ereignisse nicht
- Gewichtung von Geld ist zu hoch. Hat man genug ist nahezu alles durchsetzbar.
- Textur -Dlc für Vorbesteller (ganz ehrlich, das wäre fast der Grund gewesen es nicht vorzubestellen)

Fazit:

Ich habe den Kauf trotz der Negativpunkte nicht bereut, kann den Titel dennoch nicht uneingeschränkt empfehlen. 

Urban Empire kann weder mit Cities: Skylines noch Democracy mithalten. Das will und muss es aber auch nicht.
Es findet oder erschafft eine Nische und verbindet die beiden Themen geschickt. 
Die Basis des Spiels ist grundsolide, ich hatte hie und da meinen Spaß und es hat ein Wochenende gut unterhalten. Leider fehlt es dem Titel an Feinschliff und Tiefe um auf längere Zeit zu unterhalten. 

Der Titel unterhält für gut 20 Stunden, wem das für den veranschlagten Kaufpreis genügt der kann bedenkenlos zugreifen. 

Wirklich wünschenswert wäre aus meiner Sicht Workshop Tools für die interessierte Community. Ich denke mit deren Kreativität wäre hier noch die ein oder andere Spielstunde möglich.

Abschliessend möchte ich folgendes loswerden:
Hat es eine negativ Empfehlung verdient? Nein!
Warum? Weil es kein schlechtes Spiel ist.
Es fehlt an einigen Sachen aber es ist spielbar und das vom ersten Tag an. 
Ja es hat meine Erwartung enttäuscht. Aber die waren auch sehr hoch.

Und wenn man Kalypso und Reborn eines nicht vorwerfen kann dann ist es Intransparenz.

Die drei Karten sin lieblose Klotze die sich nicht nennenswert unterscheiden, vor allem da die in den Kartenbeschreibung so hervorgehobene Herausforderung der Hafen und Bahnhofplatzierung ganz und gar ""Wurscht"" ist da Instutionen ihre Boni der ganzen Mapp zur Verfügung stellen. Hier haben anscheinend die Mitarbeiter nicht mit einander geredet. 

Die Lieblosigkeit merkt man z.B. auch am kleinen Manko der unpassenden Zitate bei der Erfindungswolke. Wer bei Gaslampen plötzlich über Glübirnen redet wirkt werder clever noch charmant. Leider folgen ähnliche Flüchtigkeitsfehler.

DIe sogenannte Politik ist eher hintergründig. Ohne Takitk und mit nur 4 Möglichkeiten mit den Parteien zu agieren fühlt es sich doch sehr eintönig an.

Auch die Charakter bzw. Familienwahl merkman nur anhand der zugeschnittenen Events die das persönliche leben der gerade gespielten Figure betreffen.

Interface und verständlichkeit der ganzen Symbole ist wirklich schlimm. Wenn jeder Knopf und jedes Symbol mit Unterschiedlich designten Tooltips kommt oder diese einfach komplett fehen. Kommt man sich doch sehr merkwürdigvor. Einziger Nutzen wäre als Beispiel wie man es nicht machen sollte.

Die Idee ist ansich sehr intresant und war auch der Hauptgrund der mich zum Kauf bewegt hat. Leider fehlt hier vieles um das Konzept Interesant zu machen. Mehr interaction mit den Parteien durch Möglichen Beitritt, Bestechung und aktiver Wahlkampf für diese in der Bevölkerung wäre ein wichtiger Schritte gewesen. Auch politische Funktionen wie Garrymandering und Propagander fehlen leider. Gerade wenn man so viele Themen wie Frauen, LGBT, Umwelt, Arbeits und Unternehmensrechte anschneidet wäre es schön wenn das Spiel einen nicht auf Grund der Boni nicht vortweg in eine Richtung treibt sondern man mit Unteschiedlichen Haltungen experimentiern könnte. 

Es ist schade um die Idee aber leider keine gute Umsetzung",

-ЭТО НЕ ГРАДОСТРОИТЕЛЬНЫЙ СИМУЛЯТОР!!!! 

Я серьезно.Это скорее симулятор Мера-политика.Да, тут есть элементы строительства,планирования и так далее.
НО!!!! 
Все эти действия вам придется принимать не в одиночку,а с одобрения парламента!
Серьезно,это выматывает(исключение,когда у вас накоплена нужная сумма у персонажа и вы можете с чистой душой потратить их дополнительный регион.В ином случае вы берете средства из бюджета СТРАНЫ!)

Перечислю плюсы:
-интересная механника должности мера(первые 2-3 часа это весело и интересно)
-личностные качества мера влияющие на подачу новых квестов
-партийное влияние и диалоги(чаще всего давление)
-экономическая составляющая регионов,но геморно настраивать каждый
-законодательные акты интересные(ты прям ,как-будто читаешь книгу истории страны,а именно толстый и пыльный справочник законопроектов с 1800 года.Когда,кем и какие преимущест и недостатки они дали стране и народу)
-древо технологий и их подача,как в Цивилизации.
-требования партий и жителей(вы не поверите, но их очень интересно читать.Иногда они очень длинные и разнообразные,парой неожиданные)
- есть герой с различными чертами характера,но талкогово описания их влияния на гемплей иногда нет,либо они спрятаны очень хорошо
-Шантаж(веселые сцены слежки, они реально веселые и в духе того времени,когда например встречаться горничной с дворенином было преступлением,я серьезно)

Минусы:
-Сырые элементы управления:
ОНИ ПРОСТО ИЗДЕВАЮТСЯ НАД ИГРОКОМ! Вы знаете клавишу  Delete и Shift? Знаете,отлично. А разработчики знают только индивидуальную клавишу Delete.Это тоже самое,что вы не могли бы выделить шифтом всю серединную часть предложение и над каждым ЗНАКОМ(не членом предложение,а именно знаком! К примеру ,запятой или тире и т.д.) вам приходилось бы ее выделять и удалять индивидуально.Обвел-удалил ,обвел-удалил и так 160 знаков(пробел тоже считается знаком,кстати(пустой район). Это если сравнивать только с игрой) Приятно? Если вы мазахист, ПОЗДРАВЛЯЮ! Вы нашли друг-друга.  Ах,да.Забыл сказать,удалять сдания можно только изучив техногию-динамит,а это еще +3 часа от начала игры.Теперь все. СТРАДАЙ!!!
-Каждый регион приходится настраивать индивидуально(хотя,это частичный минус,его можно считать и плюсом)
-Но то что меня убило,причина первого минуса,это выключенный обгрейд сданий. То есть, у вас есть 5 эпох, и 5 этапов развития зданий+застройка-большая,средняя,впритык.На самом деле ошибка перевода-обычная вместимость,средняя и большая.У экономических зданий похожая ситуация с небольшими поправочками.
-ОХРЕНИТЕЛЬНЫЕ ЗАГРУЗКИ(хрен-это такая преправа,если что.Очень острая и жгучая)
ОНА ВСЕ ЕЩЕ ГРУЗИТСЯ, я пишу эту рецензия, а она грузится уже 15 минут!Блин,садисты.
-Автосохранение отсутствует.
В любой стратегии, особенно в одиночной компании должно быть автосохранение.Особенно в таких сырых проектах.Я серьезно,5 партий с самого начала,благодаря 1 маленькой и такой нужной вещи.
-Нет счетчика событий,есть счетчик указов обсуждаемых в парламенте,но не событий.И это раздражает(через журнал событий это посмотреть нельзя,проверено.Тупо забыл, а потом раз и получай дебаф к экономике,потому что забыл.Окей-окей,возможно это мое личностностное качество, так что этот минус можно забыть.
-САМЫЙ ГЛАВНЫЙ МИНУС
Главный герой НЕ СОСТОИТ В ПАРТИИ, он выступает как партия и является городничим,но не к кому не относится.
Ну серьезно,в парламенте того времени нельзя выступать в парламенте не пренадлежа к какой-либо патии на обсуждении законопроэктов(исключение-Император).Я бы понял, если в начале игры,нам бы предложили подобрать типаж свой партии,основываясь на чертах главного персонажа.Но нет,мы беспартийны...Хотя ,стоп! Он же там назначен представителем Императора.МИНУС СНЯТ!!! Так,еще один СТОП! А как же тогда дети главного героя.Каким-то чудом они все время являются представителями императора.Это такая наследуемая должность? Короче,у меня вызывает этот вопрос когнитивный диссонанс.

В общем проект пока еще сырой, но я дошел только до 3 эпохи.Так что буду еще редактировать этот текст и обвязывать указательный палец правой руки(гадкий delete,мне еще 3 района редактировать с 346 зданиями по 3 операции на кажное,блин...)Хрен с пластырем,тащите имплантант,это надолго.

It decides to go against the critically acclaimed Cities Skylines, and it endorses Tropico's political system more than ever before. Why am I endorsing the game? They are going in a certain direction that games don't usually go - and as far as I am concerned, I like it because it's a difficult road and not many players nowadays enjoy the city-building + politics combo. Big time. And I think innovations need to be endorsed, promoted and helped.

That's Calypso for you. They make awesome niche games focused on the city building+politics combo that just get better - first Tropico, now Urban Empire. It's just all about time - they decided to stop being lazy, go on the politics road and keep it up.

If you dont like to read, then watch me ramble for 20 minutes or so: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7V4S5lNWj4

Lets take a look at the good.

GOOD:

1. The politics system really helps the game. It wrenches the control out of the player's hands, and while others would complain, I find it the best positive thing in the game. This is MFing real life. Political parties have their own views, their own agendas, their own principles, and try as you might, a mayor can only do so much. Ok, short of being the Green Arrow, I guess...
2. They have chosen the perfect setting - the second half of the 19th century, when things really started kicking into high gear for the humanity as we know it - all over the world. I am very happy they did it.
3. The different maps provide different challenges, and the player needs to plan for that. I like it.
4. The replayability is good in my book. I have played 2 maps with 2 different families and it felt like a different game. Was it just me carrying over my experience of the first game? I don't think so. While the setting is relatively similar, playing to the strengths of your family is a big deal and enforces a number of different playstyles. And speaking about playstyles...
5. Playstyles differ, and work. So far in my games, I managed to create a workers' paradise, where the lower class pays almost nothing in taxes, and in my other game I managed to create a technocratic society where everyone contributed and went tech crazy. I can see so much potential for roleplay here. I love it. I could say more about the system, but the female part of the humankind will hate me, and I'd rather not, because I am very much into women, as they represent the better part of our society!
6. Last, but not least, the city does indeed change because of your actions, which is really nice to see. Whether it will be the buildings, the street light, hell, even the amount of people walking the streets, it's still a very welcome change from a player's perspective.

Good, good, good. But there is bad, and it's a lot. 

1. The game is easy. You will most likely be able to win it in the first go, especially if you already have some experience with city builders and how they work
2. Prestige, while being an awesome thing, is used improperly in my opinion. It needs to be family/mayor based, and not accumulated throughout the entire game. Or at least make it so that you can't use it to overrule mayor elections - because no matter how bad you lose, you can still use prestige to stay in power. While the cost to stay in power does rise, if you are remotely good at this type of game you will win, and still sit on a very hefty amount of prestige. And about that...
3. I just wish that Calypso will endorse the fact that gamers do like challenge. So far their city/politics games have been extremely gamer-friendly. It's like playing XCOM, losing the mission, getting everyone killed, but have a itty bitty little button in the corner of the screen that says ""Spend 10 Supply to win"" and by a snap of Q's fingers everyone is alive and all's good. Welp...
4. Invalid district shape shouldn't have been considered as a game option, and district shapes should have been completely overhauled - especially in the types of maps the developers created. All those corners do not help the district building, people, especially in the way you made it. Inexperienced people will sometimes forfeit a huge chunk of the playing area just because of your ""regulations"". Thanks, but no thanks.
5. Being a niche game, it promises more that people expect. I don't like it, as it misrepresents many, many things. The devs made it sound like it's Cities Skylines with a political system - which is something everyone will buy, and bite into - and be bitterly disappointed.
6. Again, last but not least, there are bugs. I, myself posted a screenie in which an event cause the game to bug and got me like 7 million debt in a tick, even though I was easily in the positive amounts of cash influx - this immediately affected my game, as it reduced my ability to play the way that I wanted, and forced me to cheat (meaning raise a ton of taxes, and the parliament agreed easily, which also helped me later on) - which is a bad thing. Of course, don't get me started on the frame rate drops... Thank God I am a gamer since 1998, which mens I don't really pay attention to that, and it doesn't bother me much - but I know for a fact that it ticks a ton more people to no end.

Time to interject before the conclusion...

You might have noticed that I didn't talk about the graphics, the sound, etc. They are ok and do the game justice. What I am trying to say with this review, is that, even by endorsing this game, Calypso need to step up their game and understand where the industry is at. It's about time they introduced multiple difficulties in an appropriate, and dare I say MEANINGFUL fashion. It's time to get out of their shell and do the proper thing. I know for a fact that they have the capability to do so, as they have proven in with the tropico series and this very game, Urban Empire - they just need to do it in their next game, or they will always be the niche dev that makes good games for specific audiences, but never great games.

Conclusion:

I am endorsing the game because I am having great fun with it, and because I believe that the developers have what it takes to step up their game and make the next cities skylines with a politics system. It may happen or not - but it is hard for me not to get by the fact that I am having lots of fun playing Urban Empire, and that I find each family to pose different challenges - and as some of you might know, I judge my games by game hours vs value - and to me, this one sure as hell merits it. Each play-through lasts about 8 hours, and with 4 families, varying political systems, and roleplaying to boot, it easily overgrows its money value. Want to make an city where women do nothing else but give birth to kids to prolong lineages? You can! (and did you just see me contradict myself?! I bet you did, as far as positive 5 is concerned...) Want to make the ultimate balanced society? You can! Want to be the best modern society? You sure as hell can! I absolutely love the amount of options this game gives me, and for that - I thank it! Do you? That's a question you need to answer for yourself.","Urban empire is a very niche game, despite of its marketing and initial price tag that suggested a quasi-AAA title.

29669628,english,2017.01.03 17:47,❌,✅,0.77845788,62,"This game was a big disappointment to me. It had promise, but as it's done with the past Tropicos, Kalypso fails to deliver.

First off, you are herded towards adopting certain decisions, you can say no and oppose, but it will eventually be brought back up and it will be more and more impossible to allow for a reform to pass. And if you look at these decisions with anything but a roleplaying or contrarian mind, you will have NO reason not to support them. 

The Von Pfilzens are traditional aristocrats, that's who I played as, yet when some reforms against my own ideals came up, I saw there were no downsides to them, it was all raw benefits. If there were any downsides, they were easily crushed by the potential benefits. So what did I actually get out of playing the Von Pfilzens instead of another family? Little more than their starting modifiers which barely did anything interesting as is.

In Tropico games you had options on how you wanted to build your city, even if its consequences were limited. From a capitalist paradise, to a communist utopia, to a fascist dictatorship in the later games. You tended to go towards the communist path, but the choice was still there. In this game it is nowhere to be found.

Second, what happens around the world NEVER affects what happens in your little bubble province/city of Swarelia/Kaisershafen. In fact, when you pass certain reforms the entire country you're in suddenly decides to do so too. Shouldn't the world be affecting me? All I get is some newspapers. The entire nazi war machine might just cross over Swarelia and I wouldn't even notice outside of one or two events and a newspaper telling me.

Third, you are forced into a democracy. As ideologies like communism and fascism rise, you are still forced to get elected by the parliament in the 3rd Era. Not cool, in a game like this you could easily represent your rise to power through the two totalitarian ideologies and maybe do some politicking for the entirety of Swarelia to join up with you. Hell, at first glance you'd think they'd do something like this considering there are two families that literally scream fascist and communist in your ears. 


Now let's leave the wasted potential behind and look at the gameplay:

It's boring and bland. That's what defines this game. When new technologies pop up you tick a new checkbox in a district and wait for the vote with 100% support to pass, do this for every other district all the time to keep it competitive. Lay down some dumb buildings to keep people's happy numbers up. They're not gonna starve or revolt, they'll vote you out if you don't do it right, so everything is fine.

The politics game, well: Rack up goodwill points with parties, and when you want to get something passed you use one of three options to make them support the edict. Parties have no personality, no real members, they're just in a Left-Right Conservative-Liberal x-y axis which makes them support an edict or the other more. You'll always want to get the same stuff passed, since it's what brings in bonuses that'll keep the city afloat. You'll sometimes get events that pretend to give parties some character, but they are usually without real consequence, and will only give you more nice guy points with the parties, that's all.

And yes, there is little else to the gameplay.


To conclude: It's not a bad game per se, but it is in no way worth the price for it. It has no meat, and what little meat you can find is barely edible. This game would need a complete revamp to be entertaining for more than one or two hours, but knowing how Kalypso works after years of following their Tropico games, it won't happen.

Govern a city for 200 years, across 5 generations, and attempt to achieve one of 5 victory conditions (ie ala Civilization). Seems like a fairly vanilla premise, until you account for the fact that you do not have absolute power to implement anything.

Much/most of what you seek to do will require city council support (via a vote mechanic)  before implementation. Within the council you will deal with a variety of party blocks, representaing a slew of political idealogies, that vary by era. Party support for your proposals, depends upon their ideology/core values, the current economic situation, their relationship with you, and player initiated political interaction (plead, demand, threaten).

[h1]The game sports a variety of other features, to keep the gameplay interesting, including : [/h1]
[*] Tech tree (progress cloud), 
[*] Emergent events (multiple choices, choices can vary, results influenced by the conditions/charactersitics of your city/mayor), 
[*] City/district planning (location, zoning, infrastructure, etc), 
[*] Municipal service implementation (police, church, clinic, school, etc),
[*] Large scale works (ie railway, port, university, etc), 
[*] Economic planning (taxes, service funding, economic edicts, employment), 
[*] Governance (state laws, and edicts), 
[*] Citizen welfare (social life, health, education, fun etc), 
[*] Mayoral elections (start in 3rd era, a loss results in end
[*] Progress narrative told through events, newspaper clippings, tech etc.

Plenty to do in the game, but little prompting to do it. If you are averse to being proactive (in a gameplay sense) or deducing the ""why"" behind a given in game result, then UE will quickly become frustrating for you.

[list]
    [*]Плохая оптимизация, которой грешат большая часть современных игр сразу после выхода. Ну правда, графика не ахти и моя бюджетная GTX 1050 Ti, казалось бы, должна ее тянуть. Но увы, чем больше город, тем меньше fps.
    [*]Скудные возможности кастомизации города. Размечаешь площадь для района - все остальное сделает за тебя игра. Чтобы добавить в районе фонари, новые дороги и др. элементы инфраструктуры - просто щелкни галочку и все будет (не факт, еще нужно чтобы совет принял твой проэкт по перестройке)
    [*]Случайные события очень быстро начинают повторяться и напрягают уже к середине пути от 1800 года к 2000
    [*]При обзоре города, если поднять камеру высоко - люди и лошади/машины скрываются. При приближении появляются. Город выглядит мертвым. Жителей просто нет как личностей, как было в том же Tropico. Там можно было выделить каждого человека, узнать кто его родственники, где он работает, о чем думает и т.д. Здесь же люди - не более чем деревья и трава.
    [*]Случайные события очень быстро начинают повторяться и напрягают уже к середине пути от 1800 года к 2000
    [*]Город статичен. Хоть внешний вид зданий и меняется от эпохи к эпохе. Не случается, например, пожаров, хоть какая-то противопожарная служба и присутствет. Полицеский участок и больница также есть в игре, но нет полицейских машин и скорой, носящихся по городу, что безусловно вдохнуло бы в него немного жизни.

Die Idee einer Stadtentwicklung, die stark durch Politik und Forschung beeinflußt wird, halte ich für sehr gut.
ABER 
- Bei politischen Entscheidungen kann man die Konsequenzen oft nur raten oder sie ausprobieren und dann neu laden.
- Autosave Intervall viel, viel, viel zu selten und nicht einstellbar
- Politische Entscheidungen sind zeitlich nicht angepasst, man erhält z.B. einen Nachlass von 25% auf die Dienstleistung   Post, in Epoche 1, fast am Anfang. Die Post, kann man aber erst in Epoche 2 bauen, wenn man sie erforscht hat.
Also erst Jahre später !!
- Abstimmungen des Stadtrates werden zu gefühlten 95% nur durch der Finanzlage der Stadt beeinflußt !
Steuererhöhungen werden bei negativer Stadtkasse durchgewunken und Dienstleistungen bei passender positiver Stadtkasse.
- Einnahmen erziehlt man ausschließlich über Steuern !
 Also einfach, gleich am Anfang, Steuern rauf auf Max., die anderen Parteien einfach mehrfach bedrohen, bis sie ""überzeugt"" sind und schon hat man erstmal mehr als genug Geld !
Meiner Erfahrung nach die beste und einzige Möglichkeit.

Mein Fazit :
Man hat, wie so oft, das Gefühl, das Spiel ist überhaupt nicht getestet worden bzw. es wurde NUR auf Bugs getestet und NICHT auf Spielbarkeit, passende Kurzinfos, Motivation und logische Zusammenhänge !
SOWAS erwarte ich bei einem 10€ Grabbeltischspiel, aber nicht bei einem Preis von über 40€ !

Urban Empire, reizt einen Spieler nicht wirklich. !Spielzeit 16,5 Std!
Die Karte ist viel zu klein, um eine große Stadt zu errichten. Das Baumenü erinnert an die erste Version von SimCity (wenig Spielraum).
Hat man einmal Minus gemacht, streikt der Stadtrat. Sie stimmen gegen alle Erweiterungen der Stadt, obwohl diese machbar wären und sogar Geld in die Stadtkasse bringen. Der Ablauf ist immer gleich. Egal welche Familie man auswählt. 
Jede hat zwar ihre Stärken und Schwächen aber diese sind nur minimal sodass sie für das eigentliche Spiel irrelevant sind.
Die Ein,- Ausgaben hat man schlecht im Auge, da keine Details aufgelistet werden, sondern nur Ein.- und Ausgaben gesamt angezeigt werden. 

Ich habe es immer nur bis ins Jahr 1950 geschafft, da in jede Bürgermeisterwahl gegen mich gestimmt worden ist.
Ich finde die Schwierigkeitsstufe deshalb etwas zu hoch. Diese kann man ebenfalls nicht einstellen. 

Die Grafik ist eher LowBugdet mäßig. Es erinnert nichts an die Grafik von Tropico und Co. 


Fazit:

Pro:
- Nette Aufmachung
- Demokratische Abstimmung im Rat

Kontra:
- Schlechte Grafik.
- Zu schwierige Level.
- Stadtrat stimmt nicht immer wie angezeigt (25 Pro / 11 Kontra = Antrag abgelehnt).
- Baumenü zu vereinfacht (Kein Frairaum für den Spieler).
- Stadtmap zu klein / 3 Karten zur Auswahl
- Upgrade der Stadtviertel zu umständlich (Jedes Stadtgebiet muss einzelnt Verbessert werden).
- Immer nur einen Antrag im Rat möglich.
- Beeinflussung der Parteien hat keinen Einfluss auf die Stimmabgabe.
- Stadteinnahmen schwanken zu stark  von Monat zu Monat.
- Zu viele Wirtschaftskrisen / geringe Möglichkeit am Anfang Geld zu verdienen.
- Zu wenig Einfluss auf die Finanzen der Stadt
- Spielreiz geht sehr schnell verloren.

Urban Empire hat vielleicht das Potenzial ein gutes Stadtaufbauspiel mit demokratischem Hintergrund zu werden.

It's a real shame because i wanted to like this game a lot. I love city builders like Cities: Skylines or sim city. Then adding the political twist! Wow sounds great... Right?

Well it just asn't executed correctly in my opinion. Everything feels hollow as all the choices you make almost mean nothing. It's just a balancing act of numbers, I never feel like I'm interacting with a real council, we don't even know the party leaders' names. 

Futhermore, this game basically forces you down the lefty root which is very, very frustraiting. Before I got this, I was exited. I wanted to be the local Hitler, ruling over all my people with brutality. But nope, there is almost no role playing. You are always forced down the same root of Fenminism, LGBT and all that stuff. And of course, there is no negatives at all for voting for them, but only positives. Even if you wanted to vote against LGBT rights, your council will probably put it through anyway. It's a real shame that the Devs put their political bias ahaead of a fun political game.

Big shame :(

However, Kalypso are known for pushing out 4 £20 DLC's for all their games so don't you worry! If you want an average game, you'll only have to fork out another £80 to them until you may actually have fun for a game which you already payed £35 for! (Feels more like a £10 indie game)


Dont buy!

挑战了过很多次，不过结果你们懂的。我选择手动滑稽。当然中文配音赞。
市政上你要是负财政，你就很容易加税率，当然太高了就不行了。而且税高城市发展需求就没了。
另外基础设施的维持费简直上天。真的很难。而且城区也很难看，你要是想象模拟城市和城市天际线那样看小人就算了，说白了这游戏根本就不是让你搞基建狂魔的，就是一套“高级政治系统“。
拉左派打右派，拉右打左。我刚进来选的叔伊斯基家族，还想当个老好人，玩到后期财政盈余巨多议会还是各种不满意，问题是我从来不管他们选的是啥，我只在财政议案上搞事，加税（其实才25％）  我看到有人加到百分之80，好吧我搞不懂别人怎么搞的。
然后他们要减我就拖，然后劝，再威胁。我也是没办法，城市不这么搞就要赤字。
要不是我声望高，我早就下台了。中途市长选举没办法，他们就是不投我，只好2次用180声望续了命，撑到了第五时代。

有人走的一区流，的确可以轻松通关，我这种基建狂魔至少也得10个区吧。有人说这游戏优化渣，体验差。问题是我觉得做的真的挺好，至少真实，又不是天朝一党那啥，如果喜欢挑战（SM     O(∩_∩)O哈哈~）喜欢优良的配音和很强的时代代入感，那你就来吧。但别说我没告诉你真的很难，希望下一作更好吧。如果有的话。

Отдельно следует отметить, что такая реализация интерфейса полностью погубила идею управления территорией города через Совет. Любое, самое малое решение по изменению города, требует голосования в Совете.

Urban Empire is a game that promises to combine a great city builder with deep political roots. Does it stands up to its claims or buries itself in the ground, let’s find out:

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]

Urban Empire is a game which tells you about the game that it was meant to be, not the one it actually is right now. A game with good city building mechanics like Cities: Skylines and having deep political mechanics like Crusader Kings II has been a dream game for many of us. To some extent, Urban Empire is a showcase of such a game.

 It starts off with style and intrigue. You choose one of the four races which are going to rule the city. All four of them are given proper backdrop and their lore differentiates them from one another perfectly. One might be a dictator type civ which believes in forcing rules on people to run the city peacefully while another is one which excel with communicating people but are relatively newer in politics and  does not have much clue what is going on. These strengths and weaknesses of the four races help you get invested in the start of Urban empire. After selecting one of these races, you can choose who is going to be the leader of the family and who are you going to play as. Till this point, Urban Empire makes you care about these factions and their leaders but it starts to falter when it comes to actual city building.

What we enjoyed about 2015’s Cities: Skylines and city builders of such quality are non existent here. Building and managing your cities are confined to some very simple mechanics . You place a district on the map, manage the cost it takes to maintain the district and bam you’re done. There is little to no customization about this aspect of the game, a thing which sticks out as an open wound.

 The cash flow you get for building these districts is pretty nice and you don’t need to worry about running out of cash until late into game when industrial revolution and such comes into play. The cities you build do not feel like actual cities which you built but more like cities which were made by themselves when you ordered. No managing of roads or actual in depth city building is present here.

What is the saving grace of the game and more or less the selling point is the political system. It is far more deeper than the city building mechanics and offer some challenge. As you move further in the game, factions start to split up and cause mayhem. You can select how your successor is raised and how they control the dynasty in the next era. It is not without its faults though.

 While the political system offers challenge and inserts some character in its dynasties, it is way too repetitive. You cannot expect to replay the game and see drastic changes from your first playthrough. Political parties more or less behave the same and do not offer anything different.

 You don’t want to pay price for a retail game and then expect such short replayabilty from a game of a genre which is known for its replayable games. There are also some really long sections in the game where it feels like a monotonous affair without much achievement. The tutorial present in Urban Empire is also very short and does not introduces you to some of the major mechanics in the game. While Urban Empire has an interesting political system, just do not expect it to be on par with games like Crusader Kings or Europa Universalis. A lot of bugs and crashes also dampen the experience of the game. It constantly crashes to desktop or back to menu which deletes your progress constantly and makes it a frustrating experience.

[h1]Visuals[/h1]

Urban Empire impresses with its visuals. From the get go, you are introduced to a clean UI in the main menu. The faction logos and leaders are represented really well visually and shine throughout the game. The cities are dense and full of small details. They look good and are vibrant in nature. Colours pop out at you while you building and managing cities and the events, while plenty, never clutter up the screen to provide a pleasent gaming experience.

[h1]Sound[/h1]

One Word: Excellent. What Urban Empire doesn’t show in its gameplay, it shows it in its sound design. From the ambient and epic soundtrack to the tense build up in the courts, Urban Empire provides solid sound design which compliments its visual design very well.

[h1]Overall:[/h1]

Urban Empire promises much and falls flat. From the bland city building aspect to the somewhat interesting but ultimately repetitive political system, Urban Empire never reaches up to the hype it creates itself. If it was a game which was released for a cheaper price and less promises, I would’ve recommended trying it. But at a price like this, I expect more from a game. It needs polish and deeper systems. I would recommend getting this game at a sale where you can test it out for yourself but not in its current state.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]

Intriguing political mechanics

Solid visuals and sound design

[h1]Cons:[/h1]

Bland city-building

Repetitive in nature

Plenty of bugs

The pros:
Voting and party goals are clear, persuasion seems pretty well done.
Reactive events based on city conditions are nice.
City advancing through time is pretty good as well.
Simulation is pretty deep in most places.
Historical accuracy seems pretty good.

The cons:
UI has missing tooltips, confusing tooltips, tons of information about stuff but does a poor job explaining what those numbers mean.  Very hard to figure out why businesses are doing well or poorly.
Social class seems tied strictly to education, too much education in your town and you run into a shortage of working class people and your businesses suffer from lack of efficiency, too little education and you run into a shortage of middle class people and your businesses suffer from lack of quality.  Could use some flexibility to let working class step up as managers and let middle class do manual labor and migrate classes that way.  An end game tech automation does help quite a lot to alleviate the problem of over education
District infrastructure... districts are expensive, infrastructure is expensive, and the benefits of infrastructure except for roads is so minor you can safely ignore building any.  Service buildings give so much more effect per cost.
Edicts generally have a fixed cost, so for a large city they can give huge boosts for almost no cost.  Somehow you can end up helping the poor for 10k a month with 10k poor in your city and they all end up with +20 cash to spend in your shops generating money from thin air.
Tax those people!  Taxing people doesn't seem to hurt them much at all, just keep raising the rates.  Not being able to afford basic goods isn't a problem as long as you can visit that nice library.  Businesses seem to react properly to taxes, but people really don't seem to care too much.  They also don't seem to mind being unemployed either.

Mixed:
The game is hard, I love that, but I'm sure many people don't.  Part of the difficulty is the poor UI, which is bad, but the balance of a lot of things makes it fairly difficult until you figure out how to exploit the things that aren't quite balanced right.  That said, the game really could use difficulty options.  There is a fairly organic difficulty based on how fast you try to grow/advance your city and going for the different win conditions, but the lack of any kind of difficulty setting is kind of strange.

After all that negative why am I recommending this game still?  I think it has potential.  It reminds me of older simulation games that are deep, complex, and challenging.  I feel like a bit of balance, polish, and tooltips could really improve the game.  I had a lot of fun playing it despite its flaws.  I'm one of those weird people who end up not liking a game with 99% positive reviews and likes a lot of games with mixed reviews.","The concept is great, one I have often thought about and I give the developer kudos for trying to deliver it.

Voting and party goals are clear, persuasion seems pretty well done.
Reactive events based on city conditions are nice.
City advancing through time is pretty good as well.
Simulation is pretty deep in most places.
Historical accuracy seems pretty good.

The cons:
UI has missing tooltips, confusing tooltips, tons of information about stuff but does a poor job explaining what those numbers mean.  Very hard to figure out why businesses are doing well or poorly.
Social class seems tied strictly to education, too much education in your town and you run into a shortage of working class people and your businesses suffer from lack of efficiency, too little education and you run into a shortage of middle class people and your businesses suffer from lack of quality.  Could use some flexibility to let working class step up as managers and let middle class do manual labor and migrate classes that way.  An end game tech automation does help quite a lot to alleviate the problem of over education
District infrastructure... districts are expensive, infrastructure is expensive, and the benefits of infrastructure except for roads is so minor you can safely ignore building any.  Service buildings give so much more effect per cost.
Edicts generally have a fixed cost, so for a large city they can give huge boosts for almost no cost.  Somehow you can end up helping the poor for 10k a month with 10k poor in your city and they all end up with +20 cash to spend in your shops generating money from thin air.
Tax those people!  Taxing people doesn't seem to hurt them much at all, just keep raising the rates.  Not being able to afford basic goods isn't a problem as long as you can visit that nice library.  Businesses seem to react properly to taxes, but people really don't seem to care too much.  They also don't seem to mind being unemployed either.

Mixed:
The game is hard, I love that, but I'm sure many people don't.  Part of the difficulty is the poor UI, which is bad, but the balance of a lot of things makes it fairly difficult until you figure out how to exploit the things that aren't quite balanced right.  That said, the game really could use difficulty options.  There is a fairly organic difficulty based on how fast you try to grow/advance your city and going for the different win conditions, but the lack of any kind of difficulty setting is kind of strange.

After all that negative why am I recommending this game still?  I think it has potential.  It reminds me of older simulation games that are deep, complex, and challenging.  I feel like a bit of balance, polish, and tooltips could really improve the game.  I had a lot of fun playing it despite its flaws.  I'm one of those weird people who end up not liking a game with 99% positive reviews and likes a lot of games with mixed reviews."

Just as a mid-game review and some context: I got the game for free as a gift. I casually mentioned seeing this game from a sponsored youtube pre-release let's play copy to a friend, and they bought it for me. I feel bad, because I wouldn't have paid for this myself. 

Currently would not recommend and here are my reasons
- encountered at least one graphical bug, I have a GTX1080 on a new rig, running everything Ultra at 4K 60fps fine, but then there are these weird glitches:
http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198042237959/screenshot/97226806231905121

- silly game breaking save bug: most people play games with a tutorial on. The first time you play this game, I guarantee you most players will not have $2m to buy the Train Station when it pops up in the tutorial. At which point, because there's an active tutorial quest, you can't save. Sure you can go into negative and beg the emperor for money, but most people playing for the first time don't want to throw their city into debt. Perhaps it was bad luck on my part, but I had the graphical glitch happen at that time too. Didn't know what to do, so wanted to save, quit and re-load. But couldn't save, so just gave up and restarted with tutorial off after reading through work-around on the forums

- as other people have mentioned, the game does not explain a lot of the concepts in the game. You have to either cross your fingers or trial-and-error your decisions. This isn't that the game is hard, it just isn't streamlined and doesn't provided you enough information to be a political simulator OR a city builder. Why does that party hate you? I have no idea. I can only guess and try to enact some of the policies they want. Increasing the density of my district will increase upkeep by 100K+, what are the benefits? 

- beyond not having enough information, some of the wording is very strange. Perhaps it's because the dev team's first-language isn't English? For example, -5% sales demand is a good thing. This is a bit counter intuitive, as decrease in sales demand is usually bad for an economy especially when inflation is not a concept in the game. Also an example of one policy says ""mild punishment for sodomy"". In fact, this policy is to have MILDER punishment for sodomy, rather than saying let's punish sodomy mildly as the policy name implies.

- when there should be information but it doesn't show. When a proposal pops up, sometimes (shoudl be all the time) you can hover over the options and it will show you what the effects will be, as an example, one policy will pop up and it'll have 3 options. You might be able to hover over none, 1, 2, and very rarely 3 of the options. This seems unintentional, and some of the effects and proposals don't line up with the flavour text. 

- immersion: the cost scaling is a bit ridiculous; it costs a LOT of money to install street lamps and pave roads. Upkeep is also ridiculously expensive, to the point that I'm now in Era 3, 1930s and I have districts which still have dirt paths and no lights. I can afford a train station, but I can't afford to pave the roads.

BUT. If you can get past all these, the base idea behind the game is pretty fun. Balancing the political ideologies (left/right, liberal/conservative) as well as a little bit of roleplaying a family of mayors, allegiance to the Empire or independence, and balancing personal finances is quite unique. The broken parts of the game (other than the graphic bugs), can be avoided once you've played the game a few times through and know what to avoid, or in the case of not knowing what a decision will do, you can pretend it's real life and not know the outcomes of your decisions beforehand. Hopefully the game does get patched, but I whole heartedly agree, we shouldn't expect to wait for a patch before a game is recommended.","After some discussions in the community forums, I've copied my review/comment - I might change this once a few bugs are fixed.

Сразу перейду к основным недостаткам, почему не стоит покупать игру.
1. Карты. В игре только три карты, но и в этом нет смысла, так как все карты одинаковы. В игре нет различных путей развития города, на карте нет ресурсов, нет изменения ландшафта, поэтому вообще нет разницы какую карту выбрать. Даже ж/д вокзал можно построить только на одной заготовленной точке
2. Нулевая реиграбельность. Поскольку внешние условия для постройки города всегда одинаковы, нет смысла начинать игру сначала. Тут нельзя специализировать свой город на офисных зданиях или на фермах или на горной промышленности - всегда только один способ развития города.
3. Прямолинейность. Развитие города нужно выполнять только по одной инструкции, которую знают только разработчики. Любое отклонение от правил постройки города вгоняет бюджет в минус.
4.Ваш город - условность. Как расположить районы на карте совершенно не важно, так как нет никакого внешнего взаимодействия между объектами города. Люди и машины передвигаются бесцельно, расположение жилых домой и заводов не имеет значения. Дорожный трафик ОТСУТСТВУЕТ - не бывает узких пробочных мест или сложных перекрёстков.
5. В игре отсутствуют подсказки параметров зданий. Например, у завода есть параметры: качество, уровень, максимальных объём продаж, продажи. Нет способа узнать зачем эти параметры нужны, как их улучшить и на что они влияют.
6. ГОРОДСКОЙ СОВЕТ. Все действия по постройке и изменения города проходят одобрение в совете, но есть кнопка ""заставить проголосовать совет как я хочу"" - и почти все изменения и законопроекты одобряются советом. В основном совет не принимает только самоубийственные законы, например, вгоняющие бюджет в огромный минус.
7. Город выглядит не красиво. Это видно уже по трейлеру.

보통의 시티 빌더와는 다른 게임이고 의회표결이 중심인 게임입니다.
도시구성은 구역을 설정하고 유저가 도시의 RCI비율을 조정하면서 운영하는게 핵심입니다.

각 엘리트,중산층,노동,하류층 ,학생,노인,여성 등등 계층의 만족도를 맞추기위해
각종 돈이 드는 공공시설물이나 구조물을 설치해야 하며 그로인한 적자를 매꾸기위해
치열하게 RCI비율과 의회법안을 통과시켜야하며, 구역을 늘릴땐 신중하게 
늘려야 적자생활에서 벗어날 수 있습니다.

처음엔 오헝제국 밑에서 황제의 비호아래 시장직이 100% 유지되지만, 
1차세계대전 이후의 시대에서 오헝이 무너지고 
독립되는 과정에서 본격적인 이 게임의 어려움과 재미가 몰려옵니다. 
당의 숫자가 초반3개에서 6~7개로 늘어나기시작하고, 각 당마다 성향이 
다르며 시장인 유저는 각당과도 관계를 잘 유지해야 법안통과에 수월합니다.

또한 세계경제에 따라 불황이 찾아와 RCI비율을 수시로 바꿔야하는 시간도 찾아오며, 
가장 위기인건 트로피코때처럼 임기연장을 위한 시장선거 때입니다. 
이 게임은 그렇기에 더더욱 다음 시대로 넘어가기가 힘들어집니다.
나중엔 RCI비율을 수시로 바꾸기도 하고 밀집도도 부득이하게 줄이는 광경까지 목격하실껍니다.

구역을 마구잡이로 늘렸다간 적자 마을이 생기기 시작하며 재정에 구멍이 생기고 기존 게임들과 달리,
이 게임에선 뭐든지 의회에서 결정하기에 구역해제를 하려고 해도 의회에서 통과되어야 합니다.


이쯤되면 생존(?)하기위해 각종 세금을 올리면서 각 의회의 눈치를 보기 시작하며,
초반에 내가 원하는 법안을 강력하게 추진할때와 달리 함부로 법안을 내밀기 힘들어집니다.
시장선거때 모아둔 포인트와 우호도를 써야하거든요.


게임의 전반적인 난이도는 처음엔 쉽다가 1920년쯤 되면 어려워지기 시작하며, 
어떻게 보면 시티빌더보단 시장으로써 생존(?) 게임으로 변합니다. 
(게임설명을 보시면 아시겠지만 이게임은 시티빌더보다 시티룰러에 가까운 게임입니다.)


가격대비 게임성은 스팀판 가격은 다소 비싼감이 있고 저는 다이렉트게임즈에서 한글판으로 할인받아 저렴하게 샀는데,
대충 3만원중반대 가격으로 구입한것으로 기억나네요. 요즘엔 여러게임들을 구입해서 진득하게 이거하나만 못잡고는 있지만,
3만원대 게임 값어치는 한다고 봅니다.

도진의 게임평가 점수는?

10점 만점에서 6.8점드립니다.  Not Bad.


1. 호불호가 갈릴 '시티룰러'게임으로 인한 생소한 체험.
2. 의회투표 제도가 색다르나 어느정도되면 반복되는 경향이 있음.
3. 심시티에 있어서 커스터마이징할 거리가 적어 꾸미는 맛이 적음.

[b]Wo ist die Herausforderung?[/b]

Angefixt von einigen Let's Plays und der Ankündigung eines neuen Spielkonzepts, habe ich mir das Spiel mit Release zugelegt. Als Liebhaber von Aufbau-, Strategie- und WiSim Spielen, hat es mich sehr gereizt Urban Empire zu zocken. Die Spielidee fand ich äußerst Interessant. Allerdings kam recht schnell die Ernüchterung, um nicht zu sagen Langeweile. Das Spielprinzip ist sehr einfach. 
[b]Achtung Spoiler[/b] Solange man Geld hat und ein positives monatliches Einkommen, kann man machen was man will, man bekommt so gut wie jede Verordnung durch den Stadtrat. Danach verwaltet man nur noch. Klickt sich von Verordnung zu Verordnung. Schraubt ein wenig an Steuern und Finanzierung. Dazu am Anfang auf Bildungspunkte achten und man erforscht in Rekordzeit neue Technologien. So kommt es vor, dass man schon in den 1950ern den Laptop einer Parteiabgeordneten ausspioniert.

[b]Apropos Parteien[/b]
Es wird einem zwar angezeigt, wo die Partei steht (links-liberal, recht-konservativ etc), aber so richitg interessiert es die Parteimitglieder nicht. Sie sind ziemlich leicht zu beeinflussen und weichen von der Parteilinie recht schnell ab. Hauptsache man hat genügend Wohlwollen, was recht schnell zu erreichen ist. Ich habe genau 1x mal meine Spionage ausgespielt, aber auch nur um zu testen, wie sich das verhält.

[b]Stadtentwicklung?[/b]
Wie schon angemerkt, ist das Spielkonzept sehr einfach gehalten. Die ersten 100 Jahre gibt es eine große Nachfrage nach Industrie, was historisch ja auch korrekt ist. Man baut dann einfach an die Stadtränder seine Industriebezirke. Allerdings wird sich am Bedarf nix ändern. In meiner ersten Partie als ""Shuysky"" habe ich alles erforscht, war immer Pro-Technologie, aber die Stadt hat sich nicht von einer Industrie- zu einer Dienstleistungsstadt weiterentwickelt. So war auch noch 2030 der Industriebedarf enorm hoch und meine 6 Industriebezirke rauchten fröhlich vor sich hin. Ich musste in knapp 200 Jahren, bei keinem Bezirk die Zoneneinteilung verändern.

[b]Fazit[/b]
Nach 18 Stunden war ich mit meiner ersten Familie durch die 5 Epochen geritten. Große Herausforderungen sind mir dabei nicht begegnet. Dafür ist das Spiel zu Eindimensional und linear. So ploppen immer die gleichen Ereignisse zur gleichen Zeit auf, egal welche Familie man spielt. Das kann man gut bei den diversen Let`s Plays vergleichen. Solange sich am Spiel nichts dramatisches ändert, fehlt mit die Motivation es noch mal mit einer anderen Familie zu spielen.
Eine wirklich nette und spannende Idee wurde für mich leider nicht zufriedenstellend umgesetzt und es hat keinerlei Langzeitmotivation und Wiederspielbarkeitswert. Dafür ist der Preis recht ordentlich und dürfte einige Abzüge beim Wohlwollen einbringen.",

At a glance, Urban Empire is a city builder, but is billed a ""city ruler"". This is kind of true in some ways, but the actual mechanics behind the political side are very, very shallow. The general premise of the game is that you have to manage a town across 200 years, from the Industrial Revolution to modern times, while juggling the personal lives of your family thorugh decision-based events that don't really affect the game much, but add some flavour.

The appeal in the game is, as with many city builders, figuring out how to do it right. There's satisfaction in getting a good cashflow, seeing happiness go up and optimising your districts. There's enough there to keep you hooked if you know the basics of not crashing your economy.

The problem is that the game has VERY POOR player feedback. It doesn't really set you in the right direction - in fact, the in-game tutorial tips set you up to fail right away. There is a sore lack of tooltips, and many icons simply don't make sense at a glance. The exact relationship between residential, commercial and industrial demand is not made clear to the player. The underlying mechanics do seem solid, but they're not presented in a meaningful way to the player. As a result, it's very easy to make a poor decision and put yourself into an economic doom spiral.

This is the main reason why most people dislike the game. The interface does not tell you what you want to know and need to know, nor are you given any guidance when your city begins to decline and you have no idea what you did or how to fix it.

If you put in enough time to ""guess"" what you're meant to do to stay in the green, then you reach that level of contentedness, but there are other problems.

The game seriously lags in later eras. The game speed slows down dramatically, even on powerful PCs.

The political system is easy to beat. There's no need to do any of the political subplot events. Have enough money and goodwill and they'll past nearly every (good) law you bring up. The fact that EVERYTHING you do has to go through the council vote is extremely tedious when 99% of your decisions are guaranteed to pass provided you don't do anything stupid. I do wish there was a more streamlined way to get through the game without having to bring up the Council screen every few seconds.

Overall, while I found the game fun enough, the lack of guidance and feedback for the player is an instant-quit for many.","In a nutshell, while I did enjoy this game enough to give it a positive, it certainly deserves the MIXED reaction.

Mal entsprechend ihrer eigentlich zu vermutenden Überzeugung, mal völlig gegenläufig- da lehnt auch gerne mal eine Arbeiterpartei Arbeitsschutzgesetze ab. oder die Gesamtheit der Parteien stellen sich gegen ein Volksbegehren (beispielsweise die Forderung nach einem Theater, das sich die Stadt problemlos leisten könnte).

-Das Aufwerten der Stadtviertel ist so dermaßen teuer, dass es einen entweder ruiniert, oder man es lieber gleich lässt. Problem nur, dass ohne diese Verbeserungen das ""Wheel of Life"" ständig nur Minuswerte in Sachen Zufriedenheit präsentiert. Die herrlichen Stadtansichten von den Screenshots sind so gut wie unmöglich zu erarbeiten- mir ist immernoch schleierhaft, wie andere das hinbekommen. 

-Die Entwicklung der Wirtschaft ist nicht nachvollziehbar. Teilweise stehen Fabriken einige Jahre voll im Saft, um dann ohne Vorwarnung en gros pleite zu gehen und wiederum jahrelang pleite zu bleiben.
Bei Gewerben sieht es genauso aus. Um den Unternehmen beider Wirtschaftszweige jedoch zu helfen, müsste man die Stadtviertel upgraden- das führt uns zurück zu Punkt zwei.

-Das Stadtwachstum stagniert 90% der Zeit und man kann kaum etwas dagegen tun.
Kein Mensch oder Unternehmen will in die Stadt ziehen? Tja- Pech. Warum das so ist? Was geht dich als Bürgermeister das an?

-Das Spiel scheint insgesamt zu schwer und dadurch werden Motivation und Flow gestört. Wenn man zwei Drittel der Zeit in einer stagnierenden Stadt sitzt, die kaum Geld erwirtschaftet, der Rat verrückt spielt und einem nur Steine in den Weg legt, verliert man irgendwann die Lust am Spiel. 

-Die Epochen sind zu kurz- zumindes die frühen. Es ist der selbe Fehler, der schon das Potential von Tropico 5 verschleuferte. Mag sein, dass für manche Casual-Player die Spieldynamik dadurch künstlich erhöht wird, aber den Städte-Sim-Liebhaber stört das eher.

-Die politischen Überzeugungen der Entwickler machen ein wirklich ""freies"" Spiel nicht möglich. Man kann nicht- ungeachtet der tatsächlichen politischehn Überzeugung im Real-Life- einfach mal als Konservativer, Royalist oder Gemäßigter spielen, da man im ersten Falle immer ""grausam"" ist, der Verbleib beim Kaiserreich oder der Einfluss auf dessen Erhalt reiner Schein und das Schicksal des Reichs bereits vorherbestimmt ist und man in letzterem Fall kaum Handlungsmöglichkeiten zur Verfügung hat.

Das sind nur einige der Punkte, auf die ich bisher gestoßen bin. Es macht mich traurig und wütend zugleich, denn das Spielprinzip hat Potential. Die Entwickler sollten dringend an einer Überarbeitung werkeln, sonst können sie dieses Spiel getrost abschreiben- ebenso sämtliche potentiellen DLCs. Für den Preis von 44 Euro ist es geradezu eine Unverschämtheit.
Das Spiel ist kompliziert, zu schwer und- was wohl das Schlimmste ist: Langweilig und frustrierend.

Schade.","UPDATE: After several fixes and updates from the game developers, I tried Urban Empire again. Conclusion: YES, it has become technically more playable. NO, the core problems regarding difficulty and usability have not been resolved in my opinion. It's still too difficult to create a functioning and thriving community, as services remain too expensive, district improvements too costly, citizens too demanding, and the city council too obstructive. Furthermore, at times, you remain completely powerless, at the mercy of the parties' AI, staring down at a more or less respectable settlement that bears nothing in common with the screenshots and promises made by the developers.

The old review is below. I still don't recommend the game.

____________________________________________________________________________

Disappointing. I had so hoped this game would be good—especially since I had to deal with support first because my purchase failed and the resolution of the issue overlapped with the release.

What are the biggest problems?

-The parties act completely foolishly. Sometimes in accordance with their supposed beliefs, sometimes completely contrary to them – a labor party even occasionally rejects labor protection laws, or all parties oppose a popular initiative (for example, the demand for a theater that the city could easily afford).

-Upgrading neighborhoods is so expensive that it either ruins you or you're better off not bothering at all. The only problem is that without these improvements, the ""Wheel of Life"" constantly presents negative happiness scores. The beautiful city views from the screenshots are virtually impossible to recreate – I'm still baffled by how others manage it.

-The economic development is incomprehensible. Factories sometimes operate at peak performance for a few years, then go bankrupt en masse without warning, and then remain bankrupt for years.
It's the same with businesses. However, to help businesses in both sectors, the city districts would have to be upgraded – which brings us back to point two.

-City growth stagnates 90% of the time, and there's little you can do about it.
No one or business wants to move to the city? Well, tough. Why is that? What does that have to do with you as mayor?

-The game seems too difficult overall, and this disrupts motivation and flow. If you spend two-thirds of your time in a stagnant city that barely generates any money, the council goes crazy, and only throws obstacles in your way, you'll eventually lose interest in the game.

-The eras are too short – at least the early ones. This is the same mistake that squandered the potential of Tropico 5. It may be that this artificially increases the game dynamics for some casual players, but it's more of a nuisance for city sim enthusiasts.

-The developers' political convictions make a truly ""free"" game impossible. You can't simply play as a conservative, royalist, or moderate—regardless of your actual real-life political persuasion—because in the former case, you're always ""cruel,"" remaining in the Empire or influencing its preservation is purely an illusion, and the fate of the empire is already predetermined. In the latter case, you have hardly any options available.

These are just a few of the issues I've encountered so far. It makes me sad and angry at the same time, because the gameplay has potential. The developers should urgently work on an overhaul, otherwise they can safely write off this game—as well as all potential DLCs. For the price of €44, it's downright outrageous.
The game is complicated, too difficult, and—worst of all—boring and frustrating.

What a shame."

     是看了NOVA和OP的视频入得坑，看上去很有意思，很有创意的经营类游戏。的确想法很好，简化了很多建设方面的内容，让玩家专注于政策、科技研发等内容，与众不同。
     但是，我要说但是。这游戏的经济系统严重缺陷。首先这游戏的经济收入是有规律性波动的。就是说不是一个企业赚4K他就一直赚，而是根据历史信息啊什么的有个波动，这个有点想法，但是这种周期性并没有什么卵用，因为其实玩家面对这个什么也做不了。税率无法控制工商业的发展，也没有起到平衡的作用，税率就是给玩家拿来剥削剥削，搞搞基建的。
      对于整个经济系统，又和科技发展结合的不好。比如说上了煤气管网，并不会说给你的工业区增加什么明确的、可以计算的附加产值。换句话说，很多东西都是看不见摸不着的，靠猜来发展。稍微步子迈的大了点，立刻翻船。事实上来说，这个和现实经验脱节很大。你见过有城市因为铺煤气管子水管子倒闭了么？（你要说盖个火车站、地铁倒闭了我倒是信，你水管子运营成本至于比火车站还高么？你天天把管子挖出来换一遍么？）
     科技系统也是脱节很严重的。第一时代你研究了警察局、诊所、学校，你敢盖么？分分钟拖死你。你见过有一个城市因为警察局把财政拖垮了？
      玩了几把下来，都是最后困死自己、不然就是啥也不盖就是等着走条，玩着贼困。很难有多玩几遍的乐趣。游戏可以输、可以重来，但是不能输在同一个老问题上。

I thought it was a more immersive version of SimCity, but once I started playing, I realized it was just a mini-game full of threats and flattery against various political parties.
You want to experience city planning? Sorry, that's not available. The smallest building unit is the neighborhood, and even the roads are left to the computer's default, crooked and irregular. Even if you want to fine-tune the layout of residential, commercial, and industrial zones, sorry, you can only adjust the proportions of each zone, and you can't control where they appear in the neighborhood.
You want to experience urban development? Sorry, that's not available either. No need to pull up a network of pipes, just click on each neighborhood, which is so boring... Can't I have a unified city-wide plan, unified funding, and unified construction?
As for the rest, what else is there to play? Wait, wait until time passes, new technology is developed, and then, maybe, new laws will be passed. Initiate bills, and flatter each party every two weeks—and that flattery doesn't offer anything new; it's been the same two options for centuries...

I can only say that its playability is about the same as a mobile game, even worse than many excellent mobile games.

The only bright spot is probably the built-in Chinese language...

So for me now this game is way to easy, after only 15 hours of playtime I know exactly what to do.
Then it also seems that there is only one way to rule, if you want to succeed. (liberal - progressive thinking)
Furthermore convincing the council seems to be a big part of the game, however if you build your districts correctly and research in a smart way they will allways vote yes. It comes down to wether you have a positive tax rate.'

At the current stage of the game it was not worth the 40 euros.

To improve the game they should focus on:
- optimalization
- adding a layer of depth
- more pathways to succes
- in depth politics (more agenda of the parties, instead of just needing good taxes)
- more trade offs for being progressive - liberal
- more benefits for not moving forward

This would greatly improve the game.

3.游戏定位。这不是游戏的缺点。我前面说了这游戏是偏“政治”的，这说明它绝对不是天际线那样大众。甚至在刚开始玩的时候我竟然有点当初玩维多利亚一样的感觉~偏核心向，就算这游戏有完备的游戏说明，一样需要玩家投入几个小时乃至几十个小时去了解，才能开始真正的享受游戏的乐趣。所以我觉得目前的评价是因为大量涌入了大亨类玩家，对非传统BDSG的抵触造成的。等到这些盖房子种田玩家离去，剩下该类型游戏的核心玩家后，这游戏的评价应该是会有明显的提升的~
另外诸如逗比的政党交涉选项~（告诉我恳求要求和威胁究竟有什么区别）游戏优化，我后期真的卡的要死~以及乱七八糟的BUG~我觉得都不算太大的问题~要么可以忍受，要么就是几个补丁的问题~我觉得一般sim类玩家是不会因为这些太过影响评价的~
最后我要给个好评，也希望大家能忘了税率重新好好再来一边，享受其中的乐趣~",

The way this game sells itself as a political/city builder hybrid is true to an extent, except that each aspect is way too shallow. 

First the city building, or lack thereof. You only really build service buildings - schools, police stations, clinics, etc. - and you are stuck building your city using a district mechanic, which involves just clicking and dragging over an area. The roads and zones are automatically done for you. There's much more to say but if you're looking for a city builder - don't look here. 

Secondly, and most disappointingly (as I knew the city-builder aspect was second fiddle to this part) the political simulator is just not good, at all. The parties are hard-wired to rise and fall depending on the eras, so no matter what decisions you make - there will be the same parties. 

The political decisions themselves wreak of a liberal, socialist bias. The game sort of forces you to adopt progressive policies because the benefits are simply all positive and there's no counterbalance to give you pause for not adopting it. There's literally no reason to play with a conservative minded playstyle, you will be far behind somebody who just adopts all the progressive policies as they become available.

I watched numerous videos of gameplay and it appeared to be just my cup of tea. Upon release, and several hours of playtime, I feel as though I've had my fill, not $34 worth, but a fill. 

The initial era is perhaps the most enjoyable portion of the game, it feels busy, turbulent, just as you begin your city—in other words, it feels as though you are truly engaged in creating a city, executing its policy, improving infrastructure, et cetera—however after the inital issues are settled, it slows down significantly. Oftentimes you find yourself barely making enough money to pay for simple improvements like gravel to cobblestone roads, and virtually never are able to increase taxes unless the deficit is immense, and even then it can be a struggle. By about era IV, you end up focusing less on improving and expanding your city through public works projects and legislation, and far more on simply hoarding goodwill so that you can sway the parties each time a mayoral election comes around (perhaps it's user error, or perhaps simply a reflection of the reality of politics?). 

Though at first I noticed a trend towards more left-wing parties and policies having a sort of inevitable quality to them (which, mind you, I do not mind being a very liberal/left-wing person myself), the reality of it is that no matter how much you support these parties (such as supporting their legislation or merely being cordial to them), they almost always end up stabbing you in the back by the time elections come around—I've found myself having no other choice than to threaten the parties in order to remain in office by the later eras.

On the more technical aspects, the game itself is good-looking (though draw distance is far shorter than it should) and the graphics, though perhaps not revolutionary, are fitting, and the visuals do not leave me disappointed in the slightest. The game runs very smoothly on my PC (despite it not being necessarily a ultra-powerful machine) on the highest settings. Overall, I have encountered no game-breaking bugs or issues that have ruined the gameplay simply because of developer error. On that same note, responding to pop-up events is in many ways taking a shot in the dark, as the impacts of the decisions aren't known until after it has been made (though truthfully after some playtime one can guess to a point the impacts they will have), and if I would request a specific addition to be made to the game, it would be to add the statistics to the decision screen so that more informed decisions can be made. Additionally, I would like to see difficulty settings and/or different gamemodes that cater to players' different playstyles or fortés, or merely adjustable/toggleable settings for campaigns that can add diversity to each playthrough, something that I believe would be a welcome addition, especially taking into account how repetitive and grinding the game can become as early as 1-2 hours into a campaign. Being as this focus more specifically on political aspects of governing a city, I might also recommend a system be put in place that would allow a player to create their own party, that way they could fight to pass their own policies and work to elect their own councilmembers rather than be limited to merely courting the leadership and membership of other parties which may or may not help fulfill the mayor's agenda. Though the political aspects of this game are a refreshing change for a ""city builder/ruler,"" they could use more fleshing out, as it feels very disconnected and two-dimensional in its current state.

Long story short, Urban Empire is an interesting and rather ingenuitive approach to the age-old city builder genre, however it is executed in a way that feels shallow and repetitive to experienced and newcomers to the genre alike. I will likely play this game more, nevertheless, and look forward to future updates and DLC, though I hope that the developers will heed the input of the community and release a significant amount of free content to improve upon a regrettably barebones game. As previously stated, I am someone who plays strategy/simulation games all the time, I love the idea, and the game is far from bad as some other reviews have stated, but it needs more draw and replay value to keep even the most battle-hardened strategy gamers coming back for another playthrough, and quite honestly I am on the cusp of recommending to that demographic in particular, but widespread appeal to people not as weird as me is, unfortunately, lacking.

3.	Creation of “Bills” a collection of policies. 
a.	Reason 1: If there are 12 policies I can pass (Have the funds and are favored by most) I should be able to group them and pass them at one time.
b.	Reason 2. If party A and B are opposite on the political spectrum and party A wants a policy but party B won’t let it pass, then group it with something party B wants. (You know like real politics)
4.	Higher Density shouldn’t cost so much money. Why does allowing heavier density cost so much money? Higher density = more people = more in taxes.
5.	More income methods than taxes would be nice.
6.	District size limits is annoying because there are areas that seem large enough but aren’t and are just empty areas. At least let me make it a national park or something.
7.	City wide implementation. (If I’m able to implement a service in each district and have the income, and funds then I shouldn’t have to go through each district and have to wait on a vote that will pass no matter what.)
8.	More and better cause and effects. (Why is electricity so expensive and costly to maintain? Wouldn’t it be costly to implement then give me a revenue from selling electricity that would offset maintenance?) 
9.	Is there no National Government? There should be actual effects of being a city within a national government. (For example If the national government joined/sided with the USSR I shouldn’t be able to be twin cities with San Francisco and Private ownership would decrease or something like that. And if you don’t like being a part of the Country maybe secede or join another country and have a way and effects of doing so) 
10.	Am I not in a Political Party? This relates mainly to later eras but shouldn’t I be in a party since I’m a mayor?
11.	Political Campaigning for policies and the mayoral race.

Some of the points I'm bringing up have probably been brought up, and I have noticed that the developer is paying attention to the reviews, so they may already be working on fixing the issues. Anyway, I need to share the things I have reacted to.

1. The FPS
When my city was growing bigger and bigger, I noticed a drastic drop in FPS. My PC can handle many demanding games without any major issues, but for some reason it doesn't work here. I tried lowering the graphics setting as low as possible to try to fix it, but the problems remained. In my case, my city was around 70.000 inhabitants and sometimes the FPS went below 10 FPS. I'm wondering if it's at all possible to get higher than 60 FPS in-game, because it feels like an FPS lock. I wouldn't have a problem with that if it ran at 60 FPS the entire game, but it doesn't.

2. Lack of clear information
From the get go, I was really confused with all the information that was given to me. I still have trouble finding information about different things, however that may be my fault. One thing is really bugging me whenever you resolve an event and get bonuses to some of the different aspects (social life, happiness, security etc.): sometimes you get an indication to what is affected in what way when you hover over with your mouse indicator, other times it doesn't. Also, there are times when text is missing in dialogue windows. It feels very inconsistent and should be considered for a patch.

3. Repetitive events
Whether it's about the sucurity in a district, the circus coming to town, or getting criticism from a local journalist, many events show up one too many times during your ruling. So many times, in fact, that you could learn what option to choose to get the best result every time. If they would be reused after the end of time victory I wouldn't mind, but as of now it's a little too repetetive.

4. Consequences?
My first game I learned about the concequenses of having low goodwill towards many of the parties. But as soon as I just focused on districts and kept an eye on the taxes, I could cruise through the game without having to worry about anything political. Well, apart from the majoral election. I was so nervous the first couple of times, but as time went on I barely had to appeal to any parties to make it through to the next period. Maybe a higher difficulty setting option could be in its place.

Then there are features I would like to be included, such as:
- Being able to control where the RCI zones are placed in a district
- Going backwards in modifying a district without having to cancel the entire modification to fix something you want to change (it's really bugging me)
- Being able to zoom out even more than is possible at the moment, I want to see my entire city in all it's glory (granted if I can run it with the highest graphics setting)

To be clear, I really want to like it. I'm really close to liking it. I have played some city simulators before, and even though they are fun I really want this concept city ruling to be great. After patching I think this game has great potential. I really like that the developer are keeping an eye on the feedback and wish them the best of luck in making this game the best it can possibly be.

As of now, I can't fully recommend Urban Empire. I want to, but I can't. I sort of like it, I want to really like it. It's not a terrible game, but it's not a great game yet.

EDIT: Ignore what I said about going backwards in modifying a district. Turns out that I was blind and missed that feature.","So far, I have 21 hours in Urban Empire.

I love city building games.  I love politics.  I should love Urban Empire.

Urban empire starts wonderfully exciting.  To start, it has open territory to place your districts, a council to influence, and support from the emperor to get you going.  The game remains fun while you create and grow your first couple of districts and through the entire first era.  As the game goes on each era becomes more and more repetitive, and the errors in and problems with the game become more apparent.

Based on price and experience, for now, I have to give this game a thumbs down.  However, it is my sincerest hope that mods and patching will really improve both the primary experience and the replayability of Urban Empire.  I want to love the game, and I think I can if they take a good hard look at what city building combined with politicking can fully offer.

[h1]WHAT I LIKE[/h1]
1.  The premise of growing a city through political wrangling.

2.  The option of the families; though I wish there were a few more of them from which to choose.

3.  The politicking of the council and the parties.

[h1]WHAT I DON'T LIKE[/h1]
1.  Decision tool tips:
[list]
[*]In many cases there aren't any tool tips.
[*]When there are tool tips: I don't need the game to say, “If you click here you will get a 5% bonus to X.”  I don't like static numbers in a game that's supposed to be based on humans and politics; however, there should be a tool tip that states, “If you select this option you should see a small boost to your economy.”
[*](Additional note:)  After which you may see a -1% to 5% modifier to... whatever.  Put some small/subtle human nature/failure randomizing to personalize it more.  We already have failed assassination attempts, why can't we have false math (aka: spin). 
[/list]

2.  Fluff/story-based decisions out or order - (notional example, but consistent with the point):
[list]
[*]1850:  Your baby is born with a disease, what do you do?
[*]1855:  Daddy tells you to get married.
[*]1857:  You get married.
[*]1860:  You have no children and this worries the city.
[*]1861:  You have your first child.
[/list]

3.  Replayability is lacking.  In my experience:
[list]
[*]Progressive agenda issue (for the era) proposed multiple times, even if vote fails or overruled.  Conservative policies (for the era) are one-and-done.  This makes it very difficult to play the von Pflizen family true to their lore.  Both the council and the populous should be a bit more randomized every play though.  Maybe one time I play and the city leans toward liberal policies, and the next time they are more puritanically religious and conservative.  This would allow for more replayability.  
[*]All families should be able to win based on their ideals.  Populist or Liberal Western ideals shouldn't be the only path to victory.  If I want to run the city as a Facist, Communist, Republican/Tory, Democrat/Labour, Green, Pacifist, Libertarian, Anarchist, Theocracy, or whatever I should be able to.  When I played as 'me' the game was basically on easy mode.  When I tried to play a role, I barely got past Era III each time; and always failed in Era IV.
[*]I am NOT accusing the developers of having a political bias, but my experience is that populism and generally liberal policies make for a well functioning city.  It's a self-imposed hardmode to play any other way. 
[/list]

4.  Lots of lag at endgame.
[list]
[*]Whether it's on the city map or even in the city council starting in Era IV the game becomes very, very laggy.  There's no point in even moving the camera over my city unless fully paused, and waiting 3-5 seconds for a button click to register is not... ideal.
[/list]

5.  Bad spelling grammar:
[list]
[*]I'm not too worried about this, and I'm by no means perfect, but it should be noted that they could use a better English editor to fix the numerous spelling and grammar errors.

I seriously doubt the developers have even played their own game from start to finish, without using cheats. Which is a claim supported by their own screenshots. Notice when they show the screenpic of the tier IV research tree. The portray is of the second in line of the Russian banker dynasty. The year is 1826, they have 12 in research power. Yet they have research almost the entire tier IV tree. Which is literally impossible without cheating since every time the era changes, so does the guy/woman ruling your family, with merely 12 in research power you won't even have been able to leave the second era.

I call bullshit on the claim of being progressive, since I ended up becoming a mad scientist after losing my wife while she gave birth to my daughter, who became an estranged feminist, since apparentaly nobody likes a guy electricuting dead bodies in hope of raising the dead.

Second time I played was as the Russian bankers, since the main problem with the first playthrough was a lack of funds. At the third era the city was making around 114k every month. To suddenly go to a -80k because of the era change. No matter what I did or how I would have played it differently. Around era IV you will want to table flip this bitch into oblivion because it makes so little sense how your city can make a fortune one month to later lose that fortune in a matter of a year. Also what frustrated me was that the bankers where more progressive and science orianted then Sant'Elias. Which renders the Sant'Elias family as completely useless.

I tried very hard to like this game since I see where they want to go with this. To emphasize on governmental management between different parties rather then city building. People telling you that this is not a city builder game is talking out of their asses. You begin with a nice open space, and your actions will lead to a shitty city being built. With definition on SHITTY! You build the city based on districts and can place ""special buildings and infrastructure"" These buildings are special indeed, since they suck up all city funds and leave you with little to no prosperity..

No matter what your political tactics are, whenever the era changes from III to IV you'll end up with nothing more then pulling your hair off your head because: ""New times brings new demands."" And those demands are everything against what you, the empire and ultimately the city represents, and it will punish you so severe that you won't leave your bedroom for a week.

The research tree is nicely visualized but the benefits are to small. It's only function is to mock you...

Infrastructure hardly brings any benefits, with hardly, I mean none.. Just loads of extra costs.

The growth of the city is your responsibility. The other parties are mainly there to fuck with every decision you make. (which simulates IRL quite well actually) They won't help you at all with any costs that is demanded from the city. They don't build anything of ""value"" like schools or other instituations that will be demanded in the future. Personally, you will be forced to do so.

Early game is quite fun, late game will test your faith in mankind, because the whiny peasants will want more rights. Work less and everything should be free is basically what they are demanding. Leaving the city without funds to do fuck all.. Even though they where voting for 8h work shifts, their children was still forced to work 10h in factories... That should give you a nice picture of what the psychology is behind these peasant scums..

Forget water pipes, sewer pipes, electricity... Forget road infrastructure, never research human rights research because it will fuck you and the city over big times. Besides, those rights will trickle in no matter what you do anyway. Just research industry related stuff and the ability to spy on other parties. Use that to blackmail the other parties asses so you can remain in office until the nightmare is over. GG.

I give this game an extra point because I became Frankenstein. I will however remove that point because there where no monster in the end to snuggle hug.

If this game does anything, it shows how impossibly fucked mankind is because of liberal decisions. 
Also, pro tip: Don't ban porn. You'll need some material to frustrate mastrubate to after you've played this game. >:(","I've played two sessions ending in two rage quits. I seriously doubt the developers have even played their own game from start to finish, without using cheats. Which is a claim supported by their own screenshots. Notice when they show the screenpic of the tier IV research tree. The portray is of the second in line of the Russian banker dynasty. The year is 1826, they have 12 in research power. Yet they have research almost the entire tier IV tree. Which is literally impossible without cheating since every time the era changes, so does the guy/woman ruling your family, with merely 12 in research power you won't even have been able to leave the second era.

По факту вы имеете два инструмента строительства. Новый район, и новое здание в нем. И всё. Остапльные водопроводы - галочка в настройках района. Строительство новой школы тоже только в пределах выбранного района, причем действует она по принципу радиуса на весь город. То есть вам нужно поставить эту школу на соседнюю улицу - извольте зайти в настройки другого района. Ага. Продравшись сквозь уродский интерфейс. Поставили школу? Вперед в палаты Совета! Где против школы будут поголовно все. Даже партия Прогресистов будет протестовать, потрясая факелом и библией. Но чу, зажав их председателя в темном клуаре можно провести пальчиком по его волосикам и сказать ласково, что ради детишек в школьной форме вы готовы на все. И всё, все Прогресисты тут же поменяют свое мнение. И так каждое ваше решение. Установить бочки для мусора - в Совет. Заменить лампочку - в Совет.

Есть городские указы, но их эффект настолко сумбурен, что вы ими просто не будете пользоваться. Кот как то так. Если бы игра была сбавлена доброй порцией юмора.

긴 시간은 아니지만 어느정도 게임에 대한 이해가 되었다고 생각하고 적어보려 한다.

게임의 장점:
오랜만의 건축이 아닌 정치 시뮬레이터 장르이다.

원하는 정책을 집행시키기 위해 반대하는 정당에  여러 방법으로 영향력을 행사하는 과정의 재미가 나쁘지 않다.

과거부터 현재까지 거슬러 올라오며 세상에 대한 인식의 변화를 알기 좋다.

가령 여성인권의 경우 어떠한 굵직한 사건으로 현재까지 발전할 수 있는지에 대해 알 수 있게 해준다.


게임의 단점:
사실 이 부분을 쓰기 위해 글을 쓰게 되었다.

일단 게임이 너무 단조롭다.
시장이 할 수 있는 일이 없다.
할 수 있는 일이라고는 
1. 행정단위 내의 RCI 비율 변경 안건을 제안하기
2. 행정단위 내 공공기관 설치에 대한 안건을 제안하기
3. 기술 발전 방향을 결정하기(이건 혼자 결정할 수 있다.)
4. 기술발전에 의해 새로 적용할 수 있는 정책을 제안하기
5. 세율 변경을 제안하기

크게보면 이것 뿐이다.
그리고 시의 변화 과정을 지켜보는 게임일 뿐...
사실 지켜볼 만큼 변화하지도 않는다.

게임 도중 발생하는 랜덤이벤트의 경우는 같은 것들이 반복되고, 답이 정해진 것이 아니라 어떨 때는 1번 답변이 긍정효과일 때도 있고 어떨 때는 2번 답변이 긍정효과일 때도 있다.
이는 너무 운에 의지하는 것이 아닌가 싶다.


또한 시뮬레이션 게임으로써의 가장 중요한 경제 측면이 너무 빈약하다
시티즈 시리즈라던지, 심시티 시리즈에서는 세율 변경에 대한 해당 산업 수요에 변화가 바로바로 보였다.
하지만 이 게임에서는 산업세를 낮춘다고 산업이 부흥하거나 하지 않는다.
게임 내 경제를 결정하는 요소는 기계적인 사이클 뿐이다.
일정 시점이 되면 경제가 부흥하며 세입이 올라간다.
또 일정 시간이 지나면 경제가 침체되며 세임이 줄어들어 적자가 발생한다.
어떠한 요인에 의해 발생하는지도 모른 채 이러한 사이클이 반복된다.
물론 시대별로 어떤 산업이 흥하는지 정도는 구현이 되어 있다.
1929년, 2009년 경제위기도 보여주고 있다.
하지만 본인이 플레이 한 경험으로는 1929년 ""세계적 경제위기""라는 팝업 뉴스 화면을 보여준 후에
정작 본인의 도시 세입은 상승하는 모순적인 모습도 많이 봐왔기 때문에
이마저도 불완전해 보인다.

결국 게임에 경제는 세입세출을 단조롭지 않게 하기 위한 난이도 조절용 으로만 쓰이고 있는 것이다.


마지막으로
이 항목은 본인이 게임을 못하는 것일수도 있는데,
게임의 난이도가 너무 어렵다.
게임 내 컨텐츠를 즐길 수가 없을 정도로 어렵다.
세입을 늘리기는 어렵고, 개별 공공기관은 너무 비싸다
결국 종합병원, 정신병원 등의 고급 건물이 해금되지만 본인의 도시는 작은 병원 하나만으로 버티고 있다.
이마저도 나중되니까 시의원들이 재정 적자라고 병원 예산을 삭감하는 안을 제시하더니 찬성시켜 버렸다.
마을의 유일한 병원이였는데...
하여튼 병원만 이런 것이 아니고 거의 모든 분야의 건물에서 이러한 이유 때문에 마을을 부흥시킬 수가 없었다.


다른 단점도 많이 이야기 하고 싶지만 일단은 여기까지만 이야기 하겠다.

Urban Empire is a city ruler with mediocre city building aspects and ungratifying political aspects. The game is a disappointment given that it is coming from Kalypso Media which has experience building simulation games. The game feels unfinished and overlypriced in its current form.

In this review I give some comparisons to Tropico 5 as that came from Kalypso too and had some very basic elements of politics.

Pros:
* Despite the heavy drawbacks, there are some good elements and innovations in this game. The game introduces the concept of council politics and how to influence to get votes. 
* The random events in the game are funny at times and have interesting choices.
* The concept of era's is well thought off and compliments the research system. The idea that the next generation of family comes on with the change in era is very good. It makes the game feel more realistic.
* This list is hard to think off

Cons:
* There is very little replay value as the game is very linear. In addition, there isn't much creativity required. Unlike traditional city builders which does bring replayibility due to the creative aspect of it, this game focuses on making decisions rather than designing. How many times will one play the same game to pass the same edicts and build the same service buildings? The map doesn't change drastically and there isn't a different way of ruling things. 

* In real world, central to politics is how you stay in power and campaign for your election. There is no concept of campaigning in this city ruler whose main theme is politics !? Even Tropico 5 had a basic political campaign where you had to promise changes that you would do if you win the election. In its current form, the election just seems like a repetitive boring hindrance that is placed to end your game than to provide any meaning. There is even no concept as promising other parties to vote in favor for their agendas.  

* The political parties just seem to be there to vote yes/no. They have absolutely no other function in the game. As an entity you can plead/demand/threaten them to vote in your favor(whether mayor elections or changes that you propose), but vice-versa never happens. I have played 4 eras and never once did any other political party plead/demand/threaten me for a change. I would like to see more changes in politics - if as a mayor I don't promote their agendas then I would face opposition in the next election.

*  There is no personality to the political parties that you deal with. They are just emotionless simulated entities that as a player you never connect with. They have their party description as to what they should be but other than that they lack everything of what a real political party is. They never propagate their agendas in media. They never interact with the player except few random events.. As a personal example - Edict to ban prostitution was not supported by Christian Democratic Party openly. Rather they were shown as Yellow in the Red/Yellow/Green spectrum of their support. How does that make sense? How can a party based on religion be indifferent towards something they claim immoral.

* The game displays a lot of data in tabular format that should be graphical. In a simulator, one should be able to see trends and effects for the decisions made. 

* The data that is provided in game is meaningless. I should be able to see how many people are in favor gay marriages for example or want a new church in their district. Rather we get tables of detailed data that I cannot comprehend what to do with.

* The simulation in game seems unrealistic too. After playing for 80 years in game and having only built 1 church in a city of 8 districs, I am seeing christian democratic party win the elections 3 times in a row. Shouldn't the lack of churches reduce the religious followers over time? Shouldn't people get less attached to religion? No data to see this, and utter confusion as to why a certain party is winning so many seats in the council. There is no demand from people prior to elections 

* The game is way too overpriced at 40$. The city building aspect is very basic and some mobile games have more features. The political aspects are a good start but feel rather unfinished. Past games from Kalypso like Tropico had some better political simulation aspects. The game has occasional bugs too and the UI doesn't seem complete either. No exit to desktop option? Save game freezes the entire game for couple seconds? City building area is too restrictive..","A beautiful idea which set very high expectations but did not deliver.

After playing for 80 years in game and having only built 1 church in a city of 8 districs, I am seeing christian democratic party win the elections 3 times in a row. Shouldn't the lack of churches reduce the religious followers over time? Shouldn't people get less attached to religion? No data to see this, and utter confusion as to why a certain party is winning so many seats in the council. There is no demand from people prior to elections 

* The game is way too overpriced at 40$. The city building aspect is very basic and some mobile games have more features. The political aspects are a good start but feel rather unfinished. Past games from Kalypso like Tropico had some better political simulation aspects. The game has occasional bugs too and the UI doesn't seem complete either. No exit to desktop option? Save game freezes the entire game for couple seconds? City building area is too restrictive.."

( 上一次出現這種議會系統是在光榮KOEI的老遊戲""獨立戰爭""中 )

個人認為真實的點有幾個.

(1)	要搞好市政必須一天到晚跑議會
(2)	全球經濟趨勢跟市長無關, 只能隨波逐流抓好時機擴大工商業
(3)	黨派本位主義可能夾殺市長理想
(4)	市長個人個性可大幅影響市政發展, 例如好大喜功的市長每一區都要開發成天龍區, 不管財政每區都蓋最好的基礎建設, 那很快就破產

*補充一下, 看到許多朋友說政黨好感度都很低. 原則上這是遊戲最真實的地方了.
市長本身在議題中表態本來就充滿風險; 政治上來說, 市長有拋出議題的”議題權力”但是沒有決定結果的”議事權力”.
決定結果那是由人民委託代議士(市議員)來決定. 
所以遊戲中市長最好只在重要議題中表態去影響結果, 如果每個議案都要插手去影響結果, 那政黨關係當然會非常的差永遠是負的.",

1首先第一点就是政党的逻辑关系不清楚，左翼政党有时变成右翼，右翼也有时变成左翼。值得一提的式，共产党提出要给下层人民减税这个提案后自己又坚决反对。当城市有建设的时候，不管你建什么，好不好，只要你有钱，全部同意，如果你没钱就都反对，这也太简单了，而且对政党之间勾心斗角没有体现出来，就只在有提案的时候他们有点用。很多数据并没有什么卵用，你只需要注意政党的好感度就行了。
2.第二点就是事件逻辑关系不清楚，刚刚说我谈恋爱了就说我儿子怎么怎么样了，看到后差点笑死，报纸上同一个事件反复出现，给人糟糕的关系。
3.市政建设究竟有什么卵用，我花钱给他们改建路，修路灯修下水道通水通电没有任何好处，我在另一个存档中到第四个时代都不通水通电都没事，市民也不会提出要求，他们仅仅关心就业问题从不关心生活，这又是个糟糕的体验。
4.个人性格我暂时没有发现有什么卵用，既然不会造成任何影响，要个人性格有什么用。
5.在看了其他评测后我尝试什么都不做结果也能通关，这就很没有什么意义了。
综上所述，如果这个游戏是一个测试游戏，有这些毛病我并不会在意，而如果对一个上架来正式售卖的游戏来说，这个游戏缺点太多，我花了这么多钱来购买这款游戏，也对这个游戏有很大的期待，我希望开发商能注意到这些问题，尽早修改他。谢谢

但问题在于，当政治过于简单粗暴而产生无聊感的时候，就像是脱裤子放屁一样，纯粹闲的蛋疼

什么叫有趣的政治系统？嘿，咱不说远，就说这款游戏的政治创意来源——《维多利亚2》。

政党不是凭空拔地而起的一伙人，他们有根基，有票仓，占据多少席位完全看影响力，如果政党力量过大会怎么样？

没怎么样，作为玩家你受到一部分限制，但别的方面你也相对的得到优化加强，法西斯上台沙文主义你可以宣战四方，自由党上台改革政治轻松的要死，然而这款游戏里呢？当一个政党做大，只有一个结果

“市长？他算什么吊玩意！我大自由党就是要反对加税！”

“什么鸡脖市长！竟然想要推行新政！做梦！我保守主义者这辈子都不允许基佬合法！”

总体来说就是把玩家夹在了绞架上，一个游戏愣是真的玩出了现实的感觉，空有市长一职，却什么都做不了，只能眼睁睁的看着城市走向覆灭。

在这款游戏里，你无法掌控哪个政党会做大，不能在群众中制造舆论，看在上帝的份上，海岛大亨还能污蔑政党与扶持政党呢，到这里屁都干不了，搞到政党丑闻，然后呢？哦，你获得了XX党的好感度4点，屁用啊！好感度这玩意负了都无所谓啊！威胁一下什么都通过了。

最关键的是，脑残的制作组，别的游戏巴不得所有游戏内容在一小时内都让玩家过目一下，这个倒好，逐步解锁游戏玩法，百分之八十的内容都需要超长时间的游玩才能解锁，合着我玩的是个手游？挂后台三四天么！

总体来说，如果制作组愿意持续做下去，愿意不断改良，这款游戏会成为一个经典，或许会像海岛大亨系列一样持续做下去，不断出续作。

但就现在的版本，我只有一句妈卖批可以讲，我抱着玩《维多利亚2》的政治系统外加《城市天际线》的城建系统而来，我看到的只有未完工的烂尾楼，一个深不见底的坑，一个头四小时游戏体验枯燥乏味让我想睡的游戏，但最终我终于撑着来到了第三纪元，解锁了一些新玩法，看在上帝的份上！

这些还算具备可玩性的内容，你们是傻逼了还是咋？非要他妈的放到这么后面！合着之前这个破镇子都闭关锁国？没有对外交流？然后20世纪初？才敞开国门？制作组，我送你们一个手势，这个手势需要握紧拳头，先确保五根手指都握在手心里，然后竖起最长的那根手指——法克鱿！

看科技树，还有不少内容需要第三纪元来解锁，但抱歉，哪怕是过年放假了，我都没有闲工夫跟一群傻逼一样的AI政党耗时间，制作组，拍拍你们那微不足道的小脑瓜，用心去想想，19世纪了一个城镇都还跟外界毫无交流？你他妈当这是现代桃花源记啊？


想法很好，创意不错，可惜，糟蹋在了一群连游戏性是什么都不知道的人手里，我怀疑他们发售前都没有去试玩一下，或者说他们的娱乐与常人截然不同？

“看啊！那是一棵树！风吹了它的树叶就会动耶！这太有趣啦！快看！那只蚯蚓爬动的样子好搞笑啊！”

The game itself is very shallow. There really isn't much to do appart from threaten council members when they don't agree with buidling a park.  Balancing income and expenditures is near immpossible. I found myself threatning council members constantly to raise taxes, resulting in party members losing trust in me which meant I had to threaten them again to vote for me in the elections.

The population sizes seems disproportionate to the scale of the city. For the whole 200 years, with around 14 districts, the population never rose above 6000.

Es geht nur ums Geld, solange man im Plus ist und die monatlichen Einnahmen passen, hat man keine Probleme irgendetwas nicht durchzusetzen. Im Plus zu bleiben ist eig. nicht sehr schwer. Kommt man ins Minus werden einfach die Steuer erhöht oder wenn die Einnahmen zu gering sind einfach ein neuer Bezirk erstellt. 

Die Parteien sind absolut zufällig und keine Herausforderung. Plötzlich tauchen Anträge automatisch auf, z.B. dass die Leute Gewerkschaften gründen möchten oder die Wahlen geheim sein sollen. Für mich als Bürgermeister und der Stadt hat es nur Vorteile, ich stimme zu und der Antrag geht zum Parlament. Auch alle Parteien, egal ob rechts, links, mitte, grün, blau, rosa, schwarz, rot haben nichts dagegen, was Geschichtlich und den Orientierungen nach keinen Sinn macht.... Und das geht bei fast jeder Abstimmung so. Ich habe in meinen 4 Stunden nur eine Abstimmung nicht geschafft und das war ein Upgrade des Hafens, da dieser zu Teuer war. Ein Jahr auf Geschwindigkeit 4 abgewartet und ein paar Tausend mehr auf dem Konto war es auf einmal kein Problem mehr. 

Das Spiel ist einfach zu seicht, ich habe gehofft ein anspruchsvolles Wirtschafts- und Politikspiel zu bekommen. Aber im Grunde ist es nur ein Mix aus Die Gilde und Cities Skyline. Aber so einfach, dass ich lieber bei den zwei anderen Spielen bleibe.

Nach 4 Stunden habe ich dann aufgegeben, denn es kam nichts Neues und es war nur immer ein dämliches geklicke, bei dem oft nicht mal klar war was für Auswirkungen meine Entscheidung hat, denn auch Jahre später ist einfach nichts passiert. Weder die Epochen änderten daran etwas noch die zufälligen Entscheidungen oder das angebliche Weltgeschehen im Hintergrund.

Falls die Entwickler nicht extrem viel Inhalt und mehr Herausforderungen nachliefern kann ich von dem Spiel nur abraten. 

NACHTRAG NACH RÜCKMELDUNG ENTWICKLER:
Ich bin überrascht und erfreut sogar vom Entwickler eine Rückmeldung zu bekommen. Dann werd ich dem Spiel demnächst noch etwas mehr Zeit geben und hoffe es wird in den nächsten Epochen noch spannender, würde mich auf jedenfall freuen. Sollte es mich doch noch überzeugen, werde ich auch mein Review abändern.",

玩了之后刚开始对市政系统，和议员吵架 ，把一些好的方案推崇上去，不过我应该和很多新手一样专注于城市基础建设和福利措施不小心财政赤字过大GG，或者是游戏中期因为太过得罪其他党派，被罢免了。

后来我看了下贴吧的所谓的攻略，和其他人交流的时候发现这个游戏的弊病可不是一般的大！

神TM 一个城市没水没电都可以快乐的生活下去~！

这个游戏你想过第五个时代，开始把财政弄正然后啥都不做，挂机，点点科技，选市长的时候PY一下，中途出现的事件随便处理下，总之保持盈利。然后你就结束了一盘的游戏。

这样的游戏流程真的是你们这些制作组的初衷吗？你们不是想让我们当一把市长的瘾吗？不是想让我们在众多错综复杂的利益集团面前平衡自己管理城市的内政，财务。然后使用各种阴谋手段达到目的，最终还是为了这个城市，虽然自我能否执政城市首脑是这个游戏的中心点，不过建造一个没水没电，人民生活极度无聊的城市真是太蠢了。

个人建议：1,至少基础建设这个环节要修改，你他妈就弄一个村庄范围的水电，整个城市的财政就GG了？
                  2,税收系统，哪有一个城市的税率是永远升不降的而且还有人坚持搬来城市来住的？
                  3,建议搞个“手下”系统。毕竟自己当个市长，没几个小弟怎么行呢？你可以利用自己的手下干更多的事情，比如什么暗杀你的眼中钉党派首脑，贿赂啊。顺便还可以帮你管理下城市。
                  暂时就那么多了，我的建议可能对于你们来说可能很傻逼，不过至少是一个购买游戏的玩家的心声。","Actually, when I saw the Chinese promotional material, I had the same reaction as everyone else. ""How dare they release a Chinese version, with Chinese voice acting?"" The promotional tone was quite grand. Didn't our famous elder also start out as the mayor of Shanghai? (Sorry, I've been getting a little naive without realizing it.)

After playing, I initially got into the municipal system, arguing with council members and promoting good proposals. But like many newbies, I probably focused on city infrastructure and welfare measures, accidentally running a huge fiscal deficit and ending up dead, or getting ousted mid-game for offending other parties.

Later, I looked up some so-called strategy guides on the forums and discussed them with others, realizing how seriously flawed this game is!

Fuck! A city can live happily without water or electricity!

For this game, imagine reaching the fifth era, getting your finances right, then doing nothing else, just idle, tweaking technology, playing around during the mayor election, and casually dealing with incidents that arise, trying to maintain a profit. Then you finish the game.

Is this really the original intention of the development team? Don't you want us to experience the thrill of being a mayor? Don't you want us to balance managing the city's internal affairs and finances with a complex web of interest groups? And then use all sorts of machinations to achieve our goals, ultimately for the city itself. While the game's core focus is whether you can rule the city, building a city without water, electricity, and where people live in complete boredom is just plain stupid.

Personal suggestions: 1. At least the infrastructure needs to be revamped. You're just building water and electricity for a village, and the entire city's finances are doomed?
2. The tax system. What city has a perpetually rising tax rate and still has people insisting on moving there?
3. I suggest implementing a ""minister"" system. After all, what's a mayor without some minions? You can use your minions to do more things, like assassinate the party leaders you hate, bribe them, and even help you manage the city.
That's all for now. My suggestions may sound silly to you, but they're at least the voice of a gamer."

Als Teil einer Dynastie ist es die Aufgabe eine Stadt (und ein Land) zur Blüte zu führen, neue Technologien zu erforschen und möglichst lange an der Macht zu bleiben.

Bester Moment:
2006: ich klammere mich an die Macht, mit allen Mitteln. Ich drohe, ich flehe, ich lasse im Müll des Stadtrats wühlen. Mal spiele ich Information der Presse zu, mal erkläre ich dem Kollegen, dass er diskreter vorgehen muss, wenn er gerne ins Bordell geht. Seine Dankbarkeit ist mir bei der nächsten Wahl gewiss. Obwohl ich nie so werden wollte wie meine Vorväter, die diese Stadt mit eiserner Faust regiert haben, wird mir klar, dass es mir schon lange nicht mehr um das Wohl der Stadt und der Menschen hier geht. Es geht nur darum, die nächste Wahl zu gewinnen. Müsste ich dafür jemanden töten – ich würde es tun. Francis Underwood aus House of Cards wäre stolz auf mich. 

Schlimmster Moment:
1854: Was passiert hier überhaupt? Ich habe drei Distrikte, eine Schule, ein paar Straßenlaternen und ein großes finanzielles Problem. Steuererhöhung kann helfen, vermute ich. Der Stadtrat entscheidet dafür, aber niemand will mehr hier leben. Zu teuer, nicht gut genug. Zu unsicher die Straßen, aber eine Polizei darf ich nicht bauen. Zu ungesund, aber ein Krankenhaus darf ich nicht bauen. Zu langweilig, aber ein Theater darf ich nicht bauen. Ich habe Pläne für einen Bahnhof vorliegen und die eines Hafens, aber der Stadtrat sperrt sich. Ich könnte all mein politisches Kapital aufwenden; aber wofür? Damit ich wieder in die Schuldenfalle tappe? Kein Interesse. Stattdessen, schaue ich auf das Modell einer Stadt, die für mich, keinen visuellen Reiz besitzt. Null Wuselfaktor, keine Brillanz. Zum gefühlten zehnten Mal wird im Stadtrat einen Beschluss zur Legalisierung der Homosexualität besprochen, zum gefühlten zehnten Mal wird er mit 95% Mehrheit abgelehnt. Die Zeitung berichtet. Ich würde gerne etwas zum besseren ändern, aber das Spiel gibt mir keine Hilfestellung wie ich das könnte. Stattdessen bin ich in einem verwalterischen Alptraum ohne Handlungsspielraum gefangen, den Kafka so hätte beschreiben können. Ich kann wenigstens neu starten - K. konnte das nicht.

Whenever I played SimCity or Cities: Skylines I always thought - 'something's missing'. Mayors are not dictators; they're constrained by constantly changing political circumstances and harassed by often viscious opposition parties. So a city game with the political element sounded ideal. Unfortunately I don't think I've ever been more disappointed by a game.

The developer clearly had a great idea but then struggled to realise it. The result is a flat, one-dimensional game that offers no depth either as a city builder or as a political simulator. The city building bit is ridiculously simplistic - drag and drop your district and, boom, you're done. The political simulation is equally simplistic. You want something? Ask the City Council for it and then 'influence' the parties - i.e. perform the same repetitive clicks over and over again - until they let you have it. It's too easy.

The different parties have no depth to them. I don't get the impression of dealing with a complex, roiling mass of confliciting political ambition like an actual city council would be. You don't even get to know the names of the party leaders - which is odd as the game is supposedly character-driven. They're just sort of... there. The bias towards socialist policies is also obvious and irritating.

Game mechanics are frustrating, too. The only thing you can really do to actually build your city, apart from place districts, is place services. These are crazy expensive so you can't place many and rather than their effectiveness being tied to how many people can reach them on the street - like most services in Cities: Skylines for example - there's a ridiculous radial influence that just leads you to bunch everything in the centre where it will reach more people.

Graphics, too, are poor. There isn't a feeling of a living, breathing city but of a dull, slow collection of pixels.

I could go on but in short - save your money (also - £35!!! Jog on). My only hope is that now this idea is out there, some other developer will turn it into a worthy game.","Oh dear.

I've only finished my first full play through. I started once before and realized I had not set myself up for success very well.

In the early stages, it seems you want to nail down getting some districts up. Things must be at least somewhat large for your city to make income. You definitely want your city to have money. The politicians are very reluctant to let you do just about anything if you don't have money in the bank for it.

I think some people are disappointed because their vision was just a little different than what the game is. One aspect of this is the way I hear some people describe the game as basically on rails.

There is some degree of ""riding waves"" here. I wouldn't say things are on rails because it isn't such a fair criticism since I'm pretty sure there are tons of different rails. The trick is getting your train on different tracks. You control technology, so you have decent control over what edicts hit the table.

The game definitely forces choices, but it seems this is very intentional design. The game isn't always about steering the ship exactly where you want. It's more about looking at the available options and making the best choices at the time so that you have more power to steer somewhere you want.

При этом - еще технологии смахивающие на Цивилизацию и гонка со временем (точнее, с диктуемыми временами потребностями населения). Со сменой ""эр"" потребности меняются и вам придется столкнуться с новыми вызовами. Борьба в Городском совете - самое интересное в игре (после поиска правильной стратегии открытия технологий и строительства). Не хватает ""венецианских"" способов воздействия на членов совета (яд, кинждал и прочие прелести Ренессанса;0). Правда, потом откроется шпионаж за партиями и шантаж, но сделаные как-то непонятно, и при всей эффективности - никогда не знаешь как их использовать. К сожалению горожане в игре не участвуют (только их потребности в виде статистических показателей0. Ни тебе революций, ни уличных беспорядков, ни преступности...  Тем не менее играть интересно всем кто любит игры а ля Цива - просто потому, что пока нащупаешь правильную стратегию развития - член сломаешь (с)капитан Янычар. Можно в долги залезать - в большие. Я загнал городок в 18 миллионов долга и ничего, можно дальше играть и пытаться выкарабкаться. Можно почувствовать реально что часто лучше ничего не делать - все само настроится. Как в жизни и бывает, лучше бы городские власти многого не делали ;-) В общем - неплохо.  Хотя недостатков досадных хватает - игра не сишком дружелюбна, пока разберешься что к чему... некоторые вещи просто нелогичны - почему я не могу зарезервировать площади под будущую застройку крупными зданиями типа полицейского участка? Где вообще площади в городе? Одни кварталы и улицы...",

游戏的题材非常新颖，这也是吸引我入坑的原因。然而玩上手之后却感觉与期望相去甚远，首当其冲的就是发展城市的资金问题，想把城市发展下去，必须拔高税率且不能搞基础建设，不然各种亏损直接导致经济崩盘……这是什么奇葩的设定？！我按照“惯性思维”去经营，搞好基建再发展，结果迎来的却是财政危机，各种赤字让我纠结的在建档→弃档→重建档→再弃档之中不停循环，后来看别人的讨论之后，开始不搞基建，果然资金能够攒起来了，可是看着手下三四个行政区……都发展到第三时代了，连第一时代的燃气都没给他们通上，想想都觉得可怜。时代在发展，而我们根本就是在原地踏步，心好累啊_(:з」∠)_
政党与议案系统是本游戏的特色，但没有很好的表现出来，提交议案进行投票表决，但太频繁的投票，使人感觉疲劳，重复性太高，与政党间的交涉也是如此，玩到后面实在没什么意思了。
另外，虽然游戏有自动存档功能，但似乎只会在时代更迭和市长选举这种大事件时自动存档，其余时候则没有，这就需要玩家经常手动存档。而如果建档的时候还开着教程，那在教程没结束前还不让手动存档，这就太不友好了，因为完全不知道教程什么时候结束，没有一个具体的指示。建议可以在自动存档的模式上追加一种时段自动存档，让玩家选择游戏进行了一段时间后自动存档，这样的话让时段存档和事件存档相结合，再加上手动存档，可以给玩家更多的选择空间。

这是我在Steam上买的第一个游戏，玩下来的感觉有点差强人意，希望后续更新能够弥补回来吧，官方对中文的支持以及客服的认真回应倒是值得肯定的。可惜Steam上没有中评的选项，所以就目前的体验来说我只能选择“不推荐”了，很遗憾。",

大概半年前就开始关注这个游戏，虽然欧洲预购价格也不便宜，最终还是在发售前一刻点了预购。玩了几个小时之后，我只能说，如果不是策略向模拟类游戏的铁粉，最好还是观望一段时间，看DLC质量怎么样，或者等打折的时候入手。

这个游戏不应该是城市建设模拟，而应该是市政策略模拟。

这个游戏让我注目的地方从一开始就是它的创意：市政模拟。照宣传看，在游戏里玩家扮演的不再是无所不能、事必躬亲的上帝，而应该仅仅是一个市长，一个挣扎在诡谲的政治博弈中同时拼命实现自身理想的活生生的人。玩家操心的应该不再是哪条道路能不能拐弯，或者几个区划排列得是否整齐；游戏中等待着我们的应该是不同的阶层和群体之间的冲突、斗争或媾和，历史更替、自然变迁、人情世故构成的庞杂的事件网络考验着玩家如何在风起云涌的政坛生存下去，乃至迈上人生巅峰（迎娶皇帝/女皇？），最终在家国兴亡、天下社稷上留下自己的一笔。

有这样一个想法的游戏怎么能不让人激动？然而，从成品来看，让人激动的也仅仅是这个想法。

不说别的，这样一个以政治（及其与经济、文化、社会等各方面因素）为核心的游戏最重要的便是内容，或者说分开两点说，逻辑与细节！把时代更替之际复杂的社会生活及人际关系刻画出来，是这种游戏成功的关键。因而，作为一个“城市政治策略模拟游戏”，开发者并没有向模拟城市或者城市天际线等作品一样把重心放在完全开放的沙盒模式，而是通过剧本设定试图再现某个独特历史情境下的社会生活，试图让玩家融入其中并切在有限的自由与既定的目标下体验城市政权的运作、经济文化的变革、阶级利益的矛盾、政治权力的斗争等等。通过情节的推进表现政治的逻辑，这无疑是明智的取舍。

然而，开发者似乎并没有在自己划定的界限里下足功夫。我们在与之题材相似的Democracy系列里面可以看到利益冲突、阶层分化与党派斗争是如何把政治决策这套游戏极端复杂化的。而想要把这个过程以及其中的方方面面描绘得栩栩如生，就需要细节，大量的细节。而Urban Empire虽然画了一个合格的大框，却没有填充进足够丰富且足够深刻的内容。换句话说，既然已经有了剧本，能不能麻烦你们写得更详细、更立体？我们在游戏里看到的只是选举票数与党派好感度、民众幸福感、预算等数值之间不怎么严谨的互动。诸多党派除了名字不同，徽标不同，政治坐标不同以外似乎很难给人们留下更深刻的印象。玩家能选择的各个家族在游戏方式与情节推动方面其实也没有太大的区别。更要命的是，抛开游戏里文字上的差异不谈，游戏的获胜目标设定极其单一，方式也极其单调，以至于这是一款真正意义上可以“躺赢”的游戏。同时，就算把它当作一款风景模拟器，二十世纪初乌漆麻黑的工业城镇似乎也比不上秀丽的小岛风光，更何况游戏在美工音效等方面也仅仅做到了合格而已。

总的来说，开发组似乎在权衡自由度和游戏性的问题上遇到了困难。而在这背后其实是内容和细节的缺失以及游戏逻辑的不完善。如果，后续的DLC能够不断地补充内容，丰富玩法，或者开放MOD让玩家们DIY，我相信这款游戏仍然有成为佳作的潜力。

最后，游戏的本地化工作值得称道。其质量与态度都让人感到满意（虽然BUG不少，但是看得出官方在努力解决）。不过，写这篇评论也是为了让大家抛开“有中文点赞”的冲动，冷静地去思考一下游戏本身的问题。

最最后，希望官方能够重视玩家们提出的意见，并且不断改进。当然，DLC可以有，但是不要太贵啊！！！","17/6/10

I started keeping an eye on this game about six months ago. Although the European pre-order price was not cheap, I ultimately pre-ordered it just before release. After playing for a few hours, I can only say that if you're not a die-hard fan of strategy-simulation games, it's best to wait and see the quality of the DLC, or buy it when it's on sale.

This game shouldn't be a city-building sim, but a municipal strategy sim. From the very beginning, what captivated me about this game was its concept: a municipal simulation. According to the promotional material, players no longer play the role of an omnipotent, hands-on God, but rather simply a mayor, a living, breathing person struggling through the treacherous political game while striving to realize their ideals. Players shouldn't worry about which roads can be turned or whether several districts are neatly arranged; what awaits us in the game is the conflict, struggle, and peace between different classes and groups. A complex web of events, woven together by historical changes, natural processes, and the whims of human nature, tests how players can survive the turbulent political landscape, perhaps even reach the pinnacle of their lives (marrying an emperor/empress?), and ultimately leave their mark on the rise and fall of their nation and the people of the world.

How could a game with such an idea not be exciting? However, judging by the finished product, it's only that concept that excites.

If nothing else, the most important aspect of a game centered around politics (and its interplay with economic, cultural, and social factors) is its content, or, to put it simply, its logic and details! Portraying the complex social life and interpersonal relationships at the turn of times is key to the success of this type of game. Therefore, as a ""city political strategy simulation,"" the developers didn't focus on a completely open sandbox mode like games like SimCity or Cities: Skylines. Instead, they sought to recreate social life within a unique historical context through a scripted setting, allowing players to immerse themselves in it and, within limited freedom and established goals, experience the operation of the city's political system, economic and cultural changes, conflicts of class interests, and the struggle for political power. Expressing political logic through plot progression is undoubtedly a wise choice.

However, the developers don't seem to have put enough effort into staying within their chosen boundaries. The similarly themed Democracy series demonstrates how conflicts of interest, class divisions, and factional struggles complicate the game of political decision-making. To vividly portray this process and every aspect of it requires details—plenty of them. While Urban Empire paints a decent picture, it fails to fill it with sufficiently rich and profound content. In other words, since you already have a script, could you please make it more detailed and comprehensive? What we see in the game is a loosely constructed interaction between vote counts and other metrics like party favorability, public happiness, and budgets. Beyond their different names, logos, and political affiliations, the various parties seem to leave little lasting impression. The various families available to players don't differ significantly in gameplay or plot progression. Worse still, aside from the differences in the game's text, the game's winning objectives are incredibly simple, and the methods employed are incredibly monotonous, making it a game where you can literally ""win without effort."" Furthermore, even if it's considered a landscape simulator, the dark, grimy industrial towns of the early 20th century don't seem to compare to the picturesque island scenery. Furthermore, the game's artwork and sound effects are merely passable.

Overall, the development team seems to have struggled to balance freedom and gameplay. This is primarily due to a lack of content and detail, as well as flawed game logic. If subsequent DLC can continue to enrich the gameplay, or if mods are available for player customization, I believe this game still has the potential to become a masterpiece.

Finally, the game's localization work is commendable. The quality and dedication are both satisfying (although there are a few bugs, it's clear the game's developers are diligently addressing them). However, this review is meant to encourage everyone to put aside the urge to ""like it because it's in Chinese"" and to calmly reflect on the game's inherent issues.

Finally, I hope the game's developers will take players' feedback seriously and continue to improve. Of course, DLC is welcome, but it shouldn't be too expensive!!!"

Ein Spiel das eigentlich Spaß macht geht dann doch schnnell der Athmen aus, bzw. man wird tot geschlagen. 

Habe jetzt mehrere, ich glaube 8, Partien gespielt. Die späteren gehen deutlich schnller , da man die Ereignisse oft kennt, da unterscheiden sich die Familien nicht sehr voneinader. Leider kamen immer wieder mehrere Bugs auf. Und dann ist das Spiel meiner Ansicht nach Bock schwer für Einsteiger. Denn ohne Taktiken (Die man dann im achten Versuch langsamkennt; aber die Ereignisse dann eben auch) hat man keine Chance. Am Anfang heißt es also Bezirke spamen, was auf den ersten Blick nicht ersichtlich ist. 

Hat man dann doch ein gutes Polster angelegt, sowohl am Rad des Lebens, bei den Kontosänden und beim Saldo, und auch viele Institutionen gebaut, kommt die dritte Epoche. Ab hier beginnt das Spiel eigentlich erst, da man nun Bürgermeisterwahlen hat. Problem nur, dass hier wohl die Entwickler aufgehört haben zu arbeiten. Zumindest die Bugs werden irre viel. Zum Beispiel die oben gennaten Wahlen. Man kann Sie teilweise nicht anklicken und beeinflussen. Sie sie dran, kann man nur durch klicken des Play-Pfeils auf sie zugreifen. 

Aber das ist noch das kleinere Problem. Meist hat man gar keine Chance sie zu gewinnen, da sich die Oben genannten Werte extrem verschlechtern. So sackt das Saldo meist von 400 tsd plus auf 100 tsd ab. Geht ja vielleicht noch. Problem ist nun die Sadtkasse .. Dort habe ich auf einmal ein Defizit von meist über 35 MIO (Und das mind. in 3 Spielen bis jetzt und IMMER beim Laden.) Und das kann man dann mit dem Saldo nicht mehr reparieren, bis die nächste Wahl ansteht, da auch die Parteien keine Steuererhöhung möchten. 

Am Ende bin ich nur einmal weit in die dritte Epoche eingetaucht, bis mich das Spiel auch in diesem Savegame GAMEOVER setzte und meine Stadtkasse plünderte. Und einiges mehr.
Die Hotfixes sind lächerlich im Gegensatz zu der großen Bugdichte des Midgames. 

LEIDER nur bis zur Epoche III spielbar und somit einfach kein fertiges Spiel. (Wie erwähnt, kein Einzelfall.) 

Deswegen ganz klar auf Patches etc. warten. Noch NICHT kaufen. UNFERTIG. Wieder MAl.

UPDATE: 

Konnte inwischen das Savegame retten. Am Anfang der 3. Epoche einfach Steuern max. erhöht. (Ging einfach ohne Probleme. Komisch.) Dann war natürlich der Witz auch dahin, da ich so viel Geld hatt, das ich erst im Jahr 2018 wieder überhaupt einmal minus hatte. Also auch verbuggt. 
Dazu kamen viele bekannte Performance Problme im Endgame.

За стиль в играх, интересные сюжеты, харизматичных персонажей, за чувство юмора и за локализацию. Игры этой студии приятные, родные, уютные. И сама студия представляется хорошей душевной компанией, которая думает об игроках.

Начну с того, что я тупо не мог построить первый район, из-за отсутствия ""контуров"". Строить его надо вслепую, а он должен быть правильной формы, соединен с дорогой и т.д. Протупил я как слепой котенок минут 40, кое-как построил. 

Графика. Ребята, можете говорить, что угодно, что это не так важно и т.д., но черт возьми! На максималках, что дома, что деревья (они особенно фигово вышли), люди, транспорт - выглядят настолько убого, что я подумал, что вернули 2007. Даже в Омерте, которая 2013 года (!), графика приятная, нормальная. Там разные машины, люди и это видно! Здесь человечки, например, даже не особо сказать, что вообще есть...

Интерфейс. По этому вопросу разработчики вообще укурились. Верхняя панель, где колесо жизни или как его там, ВСЕХ цветов, мать ее РАДУГИ. Просто вопрос. Зачем? Но если это не особо мешает, хотя меня напрягает, сообщения, которые нам показывают и некоторые обозначения - это мрак. 
1) Белый шрифт на черном фоне, маленькими буквами (!), заставлял реально напрягать глаза. Иногда не читаемо вовсе. 
2) Писать бюджет красным на зеленом фоне (!) и т.д. *facepalm* 

Игровая механика. Игровой процесс. Ну, трудно описывать то, чего, на самом деле, нет. От вас ничегошеньки не зависит. Можете даже попробовать ничего не делать. Ситуацию в вашем городе мудаков это не поменяет. Все дело в том, что очертив район и выбрав (в опр. эпоху) из чего он будет состоять, вы больше ничего с ним не делаете. Градостроения захотели? Ха. Автоматически произойдет застройка. И...Все! Вы только можете выбрать учреждения (топовые, полезные здания) и, опять почти вслепую его куда-нибудь поставить. [Я не смог его повернуть, как бы не старался, да и становились они очень криво]. Но не расслабляйтесь. Здесь же есть еще политика. Чтобы поставить новое учреждение, такие как суд, школа, полиц. участок, университет и т.д., вам нужно разрешение совета (это по идее фишка игры, такого нигде не было) но игра нелогична до предела! Почти все новые учреждения Совет ВСЕГДА будет отклонять, хотя я собирался строить Суд и Университет, а не камеры пыток. 
Алогичность и какой-то демонизм Совета проявляется во всем. Они 80% хороших, полезных Указов отклоняют. Разные мнения по тем или иным указам должны быть у противоположных партий, но забейте на название партии и их описание (если прочтете). Коммунисты НЕ одобряют улучшение медицины, бесплатное образование и иные соц. блага. Консерваторы (!) одобряют права ЛГБТ. Кароче там мрак. 

Погодите. Вы спросите ""А как же политические интриги?"" Да их тоже нет. Влиять на Совет можно тремя способами 
""Умолять (почему не просить, ну ладно); требовать; угрожать"". Чтобы вы не выбрали, при манипуляции мнением партии, вы почти всегда потеряете часть репутации и почти всегда ""сдвинете"" мнение в нужном вам направлении. Но зачем эта репутация? Она была почти всегда в минусе, отношения партий тоже в минусе, но все слушались и выполняли пожелания неуважаемого градоправителя. Кстати, даже при неуспешном для вас итоге голосования, за очки престижа, можно поменять исход =) 

Экономика. Много писать не буду, да и нечего. Я не понял как она работает, как извлекать прибыль, уходить в плюс, потому что, в том числе Совет все изменения единодушно рубил на корню. Не ясно, что за поддержка предпринимателей (только деньги уходили из личного банка) Управление городом для меня вообще осталось загадкой...Но даже на 3 эре все жили почти припеваючи. А даже если и нет, никакой угрозы власти не было.

Пару слов о городе. Он мертвый. Да, там катаются телеги/машины, ходят люди, но в отличии от Тропико, у них нет ни историй, ни цели. Тупо анимация. 
У Калипсо, увы, случился выкидыш. Мы на уровне Альфы, но не полноценного проекта. Оспаривать это глупо. Кто, считает, что просто подождать надо скидок, вы тоже накуренные или просто не уважаете свои средства и время. 700 рублей за то, что не стоит и 100 (по крайней мере сейчас). Учитывая, что выпустили 2 патча за 5 дней - означает, что или они знали, что это сейчас все немного херово, или решили чинить лодку на плаву, чего делать тоже нельзя...Тут не скидок надо ждать, а исправления 80% содержания.

As always, watch the video for a much more detailed analysis. 

Urban Empire looks pretty - that much is uncontested. The various time periods, design choices and distinct detail in every nook and cranny ooze personality. From character art to research screen, everything looks fantastic. It also has pretty good PC Performance with no dips below 60 at any time and smooth gameplay on any level of zoom.

Sadly, this performance is achieved in part by just having almost no simulation of life in the town. Street look empty, sounds are subdued when available and everything just moves at a snails pace that doesn't really fit with the ""month per tick"" cycle of the game. 

But, it's not the visuals that make this game bland... It's the gameplay. Between having very limited information (that has almost no detail or depth) and very limited control over the city building that makes it for a very hands of and very frustrating experience. Not being able to assign districts directly, and not being able to build your infrastructure beyond a ""draw a box, call it a district and yay"" is not that fun and more than that ... everything is ridiculously expensive that keeping a solid balance is nigh on impossible... oh and keeping your economy running doesn't matter anyhow, there are no consequences

Also, the expected political gameplay boils down to a sliderbar with a score on top. The expected depth of political gameplay or intrigue really never shows up and all voting boils down to is how often you've done one of 3 random events.

Also, almost anything is put to the vote, but by and large the parties don't really oppose you in any way. With neither real counter plays or divergences in ethics being apparent in their per-vote look at things. And nothing you do will have any long or even mid term impact.

Overal a shallow experience that fills a few hours before you crave either City building or Political gameplay, and it provides neither in any real way.

Die Spielmechanik ist zum großen Teil für den Spieler nicht nachvollziehbar.

Das Tutorial ist eher mangelhaft und erklärt einem lediglich das HUD aber nicht das Spiel.

Früher oder später kommt man an den Punkt in dem man einen Fehler macht, ins Minus rutscht und das meist aus Gründen die schier unerklärlich sind... Dann beginnt die Abwärtsspirale...Die Parteien im Rat schlagen ständig Steuererhöhungen vor... Ein oder Zwei mal kann man das verhindern, zerstört aber damit seine Reputation und kann dann beim dritten mal nichts mehr entegegensetzen... Dann wandern die Einwohner und die Industrie ab und wieder kommt der Rat mit der Steuererhöhung um die Ecke weil die Bilanz ja wieder negativ ist... Game Over!

Eine Entscheidung zu treffen wie man am besten auf die zufälligen Ereignisse reagiert ist völlig unmöglich da man nie vorher erfährt welchen Effekte eine Entscheidung auf das Spiel hat. Das erfährt man immer erst wenn man geklickt hat und dann ist es zu spät.

Ich habe es auch noch nie geschafft dass der Satdtaufbau und das anpasssen der Bezirke mit dem Forschungsfortschritt mithalten kann. Das könnte auch daran liegen dass die Epochen viel kurz sind um alles zu ""schaffen"" was man in den einzelnen Epochen so erleben kann.

-> Se você procura por um city builder diferente, aonde você entra no papel de gerenciamento, com elementos de romance visual, provavelmente você irá gostar. Isso se for jogar CASUALMENTE.

-> Se você procura um jogo para jogar intensamente, procure outras opções no mercado, pois essa não irá cumprir suas expectativas. Os gráficos são outdated e a jogabilidade e a UI não são muito boas.

O jogo segue por um caminho linear através de suas 4 famílias e 5 gerações (e eras), mas o desenvolver da política e decisões tendem a não serem tão lineares assim. Você pode ouvir a decisão do seu Council ou você pode forçar as coisas. As vezes você pode acertar e as vezes você pode ser totalmente culpado por colocar a cidade em falência por uma decisão estúpida, que o Council era contra, mas que você os convenceu.

Compre o jogo quando estiver com pelo menos 50% de desconto.
Ou se saírem patches para melhorar o jogo, e acaba de sair um. 
E também prepare-se para muitos DLCs.  É um jogo da Kalypso.

Плюсы:
 - Интересные и оригинальные идеи заложенные в механику игры. Если районированием и распределением зон на ЖКП нас не удивишь, то дерево технологий выглядит оригинально. Постройки разделены на службы (действуют на район и районы попавшие в зону влияния), инфраструктуру (только свой район), и здания действующие на весь город - вокзал или порт, например.

- Династии - похожа на династию с Тропико и Гильдии 2. Только 1 член вашей семьи управляет городом, остальные не участвуют непосредственно в управлении, но с ними могут происходить ""случайные"" события.

- Игра дает ошибаться первые пару глав. Можно убить город, разругаться со всеми партиями и уйти в конкретный минус. Но ничего страшного - игра сама предложит вам съездить в Вену, мол, челом бью батюшка-император, дай 2.5 ляма денег)) А вот с 3й главы вы наемный мэр вольного города. Которому могут напинать по яйцам в случае чего.

 - Игра не оптимизирована, от слова совсем. На низких настройках подтупливает, подвисает когда происходит любой сейв и тд.

- Городской совет Партий. Довольно сильно подбешивает, хотя это фишка игры и, наверно, главная фишка. Но слишком мало рычагов влияния на совет, особенно вначале! Единственный путь это тратить очки авторитета и на голосовании бить кулаком по столу 

 ""Я так сказал!"". Обращения к партиям так же тратят очки авторитета, а копятся они очень медленно. Нужно что-то вроде кнопки ""Расстрелять парламент из танков"". Диктатором в этой игре не стать, мои юные любители Тропико...

- крайне малая информативность при выборе того или иного варианта при случайном событии. Вообще игра мало дает информации!

- Графика на уровне SimCity. А игра 2017 года...

- Дерево технологий хоть и интересное и необычное,  но как то не подходит под эпохи, при окончании игры в 2020 году - 5 эра - я изучил только половину 4й эры) И вот уже 2055 год а дерево технологий еще учить и учить.

- права меньшинств, женщин и детей. Это песня просто! Ладно бы эти меньшинства были национальные или партийные. Это права ЛГБТ, притом отстаивать их нас заставляют уже с середины 19го века. Я примерно прикинул что развитые права геев и права женщин суммарно дают городу больше бонусов чем изобретение холодильника, ТВ, радио и динамита вместе взятых!!!! Серьезно? Не то чтобы я был гомофобом, но кого волнуют права ЛГБТ, кроме самих ЛГБТ? почему они дают бонус к безопасности и социалке ВСЕМ жителям города? Гомогородом играем чтоли... Короче я решил даже развить их до максимального уровня  - взять зашкварную ачивку, just for lulz.

PROS:

- Good quality graphics - any changes are visually displayed on the city view screen such as adding street lights or upgrading roads from dirt to cobblestone, etc.

- Extensive tech tree that allows you to upgrade your city in a variety of ways.

- Detailed statistics screens on a variety of subjects.

- Game features multiple dynasties to play as, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, adding some replayability to the game.

- The political wheeling and dealing you engage in is quite fun.

- Detailed tutorial that offers advice as you play the game.

CONS

- Some of the statistics can be a little confusing.

- The UI is not the friendliest.

- While the tutorial is detailed, it can also be intrusive at times.

- There aren't that many maps to play on.

- Gameplay can feel repetitive at times, I suspect the developer is looking to flesh this out with DLC.

Is the economy growing or shrinking? I'unno.
Is my city business friendly? I'unno.
Should I take steps to improve conditions for doing business, or can they handle a 2-3% rise in taxation? I'unno.

《Urban Empire》最大的败笔也是它最大的卖点——市政环节。游戏中城市建造的流程是：选择建造对象与地点——向城市议会提案——争取各政党支持——通过提案开始建设或者失败。比同类游戏多出两个额外的环节，而这两个环节丝毫不创造游戏价值，即玩家在两个环节中没有体会到乐趣，也没有促进任何的思考。在我看来，这个环节纯属带核辐射的鸡肋，嚼之无味，弃之... ...当然是能扔多远就多远。想象一下你在决定建造一所学校之后，必须跑200米，或者做10个俯卧撑，才能开动卡车把它造起，就是这么一个多余的环节。

市政环节中还有一个很诡吊的政党系统，也就是其它游戏中的派系系统。首先，政党的二维政治光谱（自由-保守 左-右）太过简单，尤其与现实中的政党相比。不同政党的确有阶级、诉求等文字介绍，但对游戏没有任何影响。其次，政党行事诡异。一个左派的政党强烈反对工会制度，一个右倾党派双手赞成社会福利，出现这种情况我就觉得很无力。游戏中期某政党要求我做出一个提案，结果它是该提案的强烈反对者。某保守党不知转了哪条锦鲤，不知不觉就占有了议会70%席位，我的任何提案都给我怼到死，游戏根本无法进行下去。还有一点，和本党与他党之间互动太少，拉票的时候就三个循环重复的选项，不如把文字去除，直接写上“好感-1”吧。如果有党内斗争，那么游戏性会有新的飞跃吧，当然前提是把整个政党系统做圆了。

由于不存在剧情，游戏靠科技向前推进。先不谈一座城市研究出所有革命性科技这种奇怪的设定。历史大体由科技发展来推动的，可以被归类到“科技史观”。典型代表为臭名远扬的野蛮系列，十字军系列、维多利亚系列等虽有科技树等要素，但并非决定性的导向历史前进。野蛮中，有一个“必须发展科技”的理由，那就是其它玩家（电脑）的竞争，一个决定输赢的推动力。但是在《城市帝国》中，没有这么一个发展理由，不点亮科技树，你不会面临惩罚，不会game over，甚至能够取得游戏胜利。（开局建立第一个行政区，保持盈余后挂机30小时即可获胜）相反，你若发展科技，建造新设施，反而会面临财政危机。如此，玩家发展科技纯粹为了发展科技。此外，科技系统毫无诚意，仿佛从维基上摘抄下来。且所有科技只有正面效果没有负面（研究煤炭石油会不会导致污染？基因技术会不会触发伦理危机？），也不存在一个优先程度。于是，玩家只能选择无脑发展科技。

以上是三个本作最大败笔，这三个完全是爆炸级别的，充分证明制作组空有一个好点子，却缺乏能力展现，在策划初期的不承受已然奠定失败基础。除这三个以外还有一些细节问题和优化问题。有一点必须说一下，玩家扮演的市长自带各种属性（拒绝新事物、残忍等），为游戏增添不少乐趣。但是，我无法忍受的是！在游戏的一些事件选项中！竟然可以改变你的市长性格！这个设定直接毁掉了所有的乐趣！！！如果游戏的限定能改变，那限定的意义在哪里！！！想象一款纯情恋爱游戏，你的青梅竹马攻略对象喜欢的礼物是饰品，喜欢温柔的性格。你做选项时必然顾及条条限制。可是玩了一会儿，青梅竹马只收黄金礼物，喜欢渣男性格，你还不怒摔键盘！

扯远了。如果本作想要打造一个ip，出续作吃饭。我觉得一个回炉重造级别的补丁是必须的。当然，捞一笔就走当我没说。

市政环节避免反复拉票，一个提案一次拉票就足够了。更关键的是，要用其他多种多样的手段替代拉票，却起到同样效果。比如一段接受贿赂的剧情，或者和某个政党达成秘密协议。政党系统别闹笑话，优化一下逻辑，给政党多加点数据，并且和城市建设相关联。比如小秘书告诉你，某党最近阻止了一场女权游行，纺织行业因此停工。科技树，太难看了，想办法取消吧，别研究科技了，到时间自动获取科技，或者最好向模拟城市5学习，生产规模扩大后科技升级。

重中之重，要有这样一个故事背景，如果你不执政，该市就走下坡路，游戏会输啊。你在为千万市民的福祉而努力奋斗。其他党派都是搅屎棍害人精，只有你能够救人民于水火，而人民也会感谢你。（cg、插画、艺术集、小游戏、小故事、小道具、小buff）

Понятно, что игра больше является симулятором городского совета, нежели градостроительством, но ведь основное занятие любого городского совета - это бесконечные игры с электоратом (гражданами), когда кто-то из граждан что-то предлагает, требует (митинги, демонстрации, жалобы) для улучшения качества жизни и вокруг всего этого и строятся игры политических партий, которые продвигают интересы своего избирателя. Городской совет - это постоянный конфликт интересов на фоне одного единственного бюджета, где каждый хочет на себя перетянуть больший кусок, через выполнение пожеланий своих избирателей. Так вот всех этих вкусностей и интересностей в игре нет. Глядя на город вы не видете НИЧЕГО кроме не самых оригинальных и графически не интересных домиков. Например, при строительстве вокзала, что ожидается? конечно же оживление жизни вокруг него, но здесь за все время существования вокзала к нему не подъехала ни одна повозка, не подошел ни один житель. В город из вне не приезжает ни один житель, единственное указание на рост населения - это циферка вверху экрана и все. Вся эта убогая реализация городской жизни ничего кроме тоски не вызывает, а при отсутствии реализации активной политической жизни и однотипность вариантов действий во взаимоотношениях с политическими партиями убивают всю идею игры, хотя идея создания градостроительного симулятора с упором на политическую жизнь очень интересна.",

Spillet er ganske udemærket, hvis man er til spil med politisk indhold, lidt ala spillet Democracy.
Det sagt så er det et spil som nok ikke falder i alles smag og den relative høje pris er bestemt også værd at tage i betragtning. Personligt har jeg haft en godt oplevelse med spillet indtil videre, og er spændt på hvad kommende DLC vil kunne tilbyde.
Det du får i spillet er en kampagne del hvor du kan vælge imellem 4 forskellige familier og spille som, og en scenarie del som indeholder 3 forskellige scenarier. I kampagne delen skal du spille dig frem i tiden, med start i 1820 og afslutning i 2020. Der er flere forskillige måder at vinde kampagnedelen på, bl.a. teknologisk-, økonomisk- og politisk sejr.
Jeg vil bestemt anbefale spillet til dem, som finder de ovenstående spil interessante og udfordrene.

En samlet vurdering vil jeg give lidt over middel - 6/10 - Primært grundet den relative høje pris samlignet med andre ligende spil på markedet som giver lidt mere i pakken.

W momencie kiedy kupiłem grę, nie było jeszcze recenzji...
W momencie kiedy się one pojawiły, odpaliłem grę w nadzieji że nie jest tak źle...

Już od samego początku coś jest nie tak. Grafika jest ładna, ręczne rysunki piekne. Ale gameplay jest skopany.

- Tutorial jest wykonany lakonicznie i jest super krótki. Jak ten komentarz;) Zwykły mały tekst w rogu ekranu, pojedyńcze proste zdania, wybierz menu to i to, kliknij na tą opcję, wybuduj gdzieś ten budyenk. Widać brak jakiejkolwiek staranności nad wykonaniem tutoriala.

- W SimCity budujesz strefy mieszkalne/gospodarcze/przemysłowe gdzie i jak chcesz. Tutaj budujesz dystrykt który AUTOMATYCZNIE jest wypełniany tymi strafami. Jest to negatywne uproszczenie. Wiem wiem... ta gra to city manager,a nie city buldier, ale to uproszczenie ze strafami jest nie fajne. Nie mogę stworzyć 1 wielkiej strefy przemysłowej zdala od stref mieszkalnych. No i w Cim City to trwa taką zdrową chwilę, tutaj niesamowicie szybko powstają budowle.

- System głosowań. Fajnie wygląda na filmikach. Bo jest ładny. Ale jest nudny. I po 3 głosowaniach stwierdzam że jest bardzo powtarzalny. Składasz propozycję głosowania. Potem na przestrzeni czasu żądasz/prosisz/domagasz się żeby ktoś Ciebie poparł (kliknięcie przycisku). Po upływie pewnego czasu jest decyzja o głosowaniu Czy się udało np. podnieść podatki czy nie.

- Ogólnie ten świat jest taki... ""martwy/nieprawdziwy"" Porównam to do innej gry ""Motosport manager"" w której wcielamy się w managera Formuły 1. Po kliku dniach zgłaszqa się do nas technolog i mówi że trzeba zaprojektować bolidy na przyszły rok. Potem dastaję maila że jakaś stacja TV chce zrobić ze mną wywiad, potem otrzymuję informację że skończono udoskonalać zawieszenia, mam wybrać nowy projekt. Kierowca ma urodziny, kupić mu prezent czy nie? Przyszły wyniki z głównych wyścigów, mogę je przeglądnąć. 5 dni przed treningiem kończy się umowa z kierowcą, gdzie ja w 5 dni nowego kierowcę znajdę? muszę mu ją przedłużyć... mimo że nie chcę. No trudno, moja wina, niedpoilnowałem. itp itd. W tej grze czuję że jestem elementem świata. Ciągle się coś dzieje, i ten świat żyje też własnym życiem.


Natomiast w Urban Empire... nie ma tego wrażenia. Ten świat jest taki sztywny, jakby mu ktoś kij w d... włożył.
Ja na grę która ma cenę AAA, gracz wymaga produktu AAA i widzi kiedy to jest tylko ładnie opakowany szmelc. Tzn ""szmelc"" to trochę za mocne słowo, bo gra nie jest złym produktem.

Jednak jeżeli nikomu nieznany prodcent ""Reborn Games"" bez doświadczenia tworzy grę za 45 euro, umożliwia przedsprzedaż już około roku przed premierą, to potem są takie skutki: ocena: 49%. A gra jest naprawdę średnia. I kompletnie nie warta wydania 200zł...",

  在大多数模拟类游戏里，不管你政体是民主还是独裁，实际上所有的抉择都是依靠玩家的个人意志执行的。但《URBAN EMPIRE》这款游戏却不是。大大小小的事，从调整税率通过法令，到城市修建下水道铺设电网之类的全部都要议会来表决通过。我觉得这个优点是很难能所得的。
   但——既然游戏主要的玩法就是议会。我不能理解为什么我扮演的人物却不能参与进去？而是一个世袭领导人的形象？
   为什么我的政治影响很多时候并不能影响党派对我的看法？
   为什么我在恳求党派投赞成票的时候议员会觉得我的乞求像个乞丐，并且扣掉我3点的党派好感度？
   火车站，码头有什么用？为什么我修建之后经济反而变得更糟？

给些攻略或者建议好了，城区尽量造大点，居民区尽量少造点，反正我是从阶段1到5始终都是4个城区有人，其他纯工业，毕竟到后期人民需求高了城区基础设施成本就高了。还有趁前期钦定，多做些事。到后期政党不待见你也别怕，哪怕是换届选举失败，也可以用声望直接驳回否决，继续当市长。",

It's 1960, my people are quite happy with my governing of the city, there's no water lines, sewage pipes or electric anywhere within the city. Despite this the Television business is booming, not sure how my people intend to watch the TV's, but I can't judge them.
The roads are still the same old dirt roads from the 1800's everyone is happy to drive around their cars on this with minimal traffic problems.
The communist party is quite happy for me to raise tax on the working class and lower it for the elite.

The game boasts having an indepth political system where you need to battle with different parties to make changes, but there's no point at all in picking favourites to buddy up with as all relations with these parties will reset back to 0 after a couple of years. So you can generally treat them how you want.
City expansion only becomes a problem if you have both a low income and low funds in the account, as then all parties will try to block all decisions you make. However if you're sitting there with a few hundred k in the bank, they will generally green light everything you want to do, like build an electrical power plant purely to export the power it creates.
The parties as well are not really sticking to what you think they would, you will quite often see the conservatives pushing for social equality with the progressive sides trying to block these movements, and as mentioned before, communists liking to tax the working class high.

The people in your city are quite happy to live with no water, electric or gas supplies. You can add these services to districts, but you get no return for doing so, people won't pay extra for them, so you're just throwing money away. They do claim to ""boost companies"" but again, increasing the sales of companies in your city doesn't actually do anything for your own income.

The rpg story elements hardly do anything for the game, you can choose one of 4 families with different back stories and ideas towards governing. All switching between these really does it decide which events you're going to get, and they will be the same ones each time at the exact same time, you get a few outside of this, like parties wanting to make you honourary members etc. but they're mostly meaningless. 
Your character has traits, cruel, soft, opitmist etc. again, mostly meaningless. You might get the odd event pop up with a response option blocked due to lack of x trait, but refering back, your traits and what you say on these windows rarely matters.

Until elections come around, you don't need to make your citizens happy at all. No chance of an uprising due to lack of healthcare, policing, leisure or anything at all. You can quite happily ignore all the demands of your citizens until the ability to vote comes along, and you can even try to prevent that for an extended time.

Small aesthetic thing that bothers me. Why can I see loads of cars driving around my city when I've not even researched them yet. Also why do all the houses and shops have lights on at night if there's absoloutely no electrical grids in the city.

The game had some great ideas with the whole political thing, you can even blackmail parties, but they just don't mean anything towards running the city. You can spend the entire game never having to speak to any of them apart from suggesting changes to the city and waiting for them to agree on it.
And the fact that you can have a city with 0 utilities and everyone is ok with that bewilders me, but then you can't afford to give them to the entire city anyway.

Минусы: 
- Оптимизация. Первоначально игра жутко лагала даже на самых минимальных настройках, но гугл помог мне найти способ как сделать игру играбильной и всё запустилось на максимуме. Однако когда город достиг 50к+ жителей игра снова стала жутко тормозить на любых настройках (i7, 8gb, 740m)
- Ожидания и реальность. Ожидал увидеть абсолютно новый подход по управлению города через городской совет,со своей атмосферой и сложностями. По факту получил обычный градостроитель, где часто приходится ждать что скажет совет и если он против, то жать одни и теже кнопки для получения нужного решения. Т.е. тоже самое как у всех,но с дополнительыми сложностями.
- Механика и информативность. Как и сюжет в Дарк Соулс, законы этой игры нужно изучать либо методом ""проб и ошибок"", либо идти гуглить (но пока мало чего можно найти). Многие аспекты игры так и остались тайной для меня после 30 часов игры. Половина возможностей игры и вовсе ненужна, так например инфраструктура 4 и 5 эпохи мне не пригодилась, но город при этом процветал по всем направлениям.
- Маленькая карта. Минус или плюс это, каждый сам должен сделать выбор. Мне лично хотелось бы увелечение карты, т.к. в первые 10 лет застроил 50% карты,а к середине игры застроил 90%.
- События. Первоначально события в игре мне показались интересными и вносили некоторые интересные правки в жизнь города. Но со временем эти события превращаются в что-то повторяющееся и скучное. Внешний мир тоже не очень влияет на жизнь города.
- Исследования. Большая надежда на то,что каждое исследования будут сильно влиять на жизнь города, а выбранные ветки будут делать город уникальным... Но так можно сказать (и то с натяжкой) про первые две эры. Далее исследования дают либо закрыть проблемы в бюджете, либо решить проблемы граждан. Так же есть особенные здания, но и они достаточно примитивны и при хорошей экономики их легко поставить и прокачать по максимуму. 
- Деньги играют всё. Есть финансы, значит вы можете сделать 90% того,чего захотите. Как только просидает этот параметер, так сразу у вас/ и настают проблемы вплоть до того, что очень легко не выбраться из финансовой ямы (совет очень не любит разрушение районов,которые могут финансово уничтожать вас).


Плюсы:
- Эпохи. Реально круто начать с 1820 года, отличная дата для старта. И дойти до скорого будущего. Визуально город меняется и ты проживаешь каждую эпоху с городом.
- Устройство районов. Неплохая концепция районов и их размеров. По сути любой район не может быть очень большим, но при этом каждый район включает в себя свой маленький мир.
- Уникальность городов. Лучший способ получить удовольствие в этой игре, это начинать игру заново после 2-3 эпохи. В этот период можно делать реально разные города со своими правилами. А дальше всё упирается в размеры, финансы и прочие типичные проблемы.

Итог. 
Требуются патчи,патчи и ещё раз патчи. Либо пусть делают вторую часть, которая будет реально новым градостроителем со всей атмосферой и отдают мне ключ бесплатно за предзаказ 1 части. Надеюсь разработчики не бросят игру на том что есть сейчас.",

    开发者犯了一个致命的错误，非常致命！
    开发者用发达地区的现有经济去做了一个1820年国民产值的游戏！换句话说，一些发达国家或地区，看病不要钱，1820年也不要？煤气不要钱，1820年也不要？自来水不要钱，1820年也不要？通讯不要钱，1820年也不要？而等等这些问题在游戏中却只能体现在税收上面。
    做一个很简单的改动，这个游戏乐趣会大一倍不止。比如说，一个区域通电了，那么应该收取相应的电费，我们可以随着时代、时间、空间的改变而做不同的调整，用调整的办法来获取不同的人民党派支持率，进而为议会做各种决定产生不同的结果。
    再做一个改动，如可以自主建设一些国家工厂，做做贸易，进一步加强与外国的互动，从而带动文化、经济等，不是更有趣么？我们点了那么多的科技树，尼龙的发明改变了世界，别的不说，建个比基尼工厂就行。
    最让我崩溃的一次就是刚才，我发展了百十来年，弹出一个事件，没有选项。。。不能终止。。。时间不再流动。。。只能删档！！！

在前期基本不要考虑建筑设施和基建的设置了  
不然亏成狗 还好人民并不会因此反抗你（有一次税率加到95% 人民都没啥反应...）

中后期设施的服务范围大的可怕 所以不需要太急着造

只要你不亏损 有很多钱的话 建造东西都给过

有钱基本可以不用理政党 除了法案以外爱干啥干啥

在你有钱的时候 政党给你的阻力只有连任还有一些法案的实施
连任可以撤回所以也不算问题","The Chinese localization is indeed high quality. There are a few bugs, and the optimization is a bit poor. Even the lowest setting in the later stages can cause lags. Is it really my computer?

In the early stages, basically don't worry about setting up buildings, facilities, or infrastructure. Otherwise, you'll lose a lot of money. Fortunately, the people won't rebel against you (I once raised the tax rate to 95%, and the people didn't react at all...).

The service scope of facilities in the mid-to-late stages is incredibly large, so there's no need to rush to build.

As long as you're not losing money and have a lot of money, you can build anything.

With money, you can basically ignore political parties and do whatever you want, except for bills.

When you have money, the only obstacles political parties pose to you are re-election and the implementation of some bills. Re-election can be withdrawn, so it's not a problem."

很遗憾，看了直播的小伙伴，大部分表示不想买了。
俗话说，拿人手短，我拿了KEY，照理应该说点好话。但是游戏的实际表现并不是几个软文好评能够挽回口碑的。
所以，请允许我给一个差评，相对的，游戏到底在哪些方面还需改进？我来进行比较深入和专业的整理。
以下评价基于游戏发售第二天的版本，希望一段时间后，有人会来说，你的这份评测过时了！

1.优化。
游戏的优化大有问题。
首先，越玩越卡，并且无论多高的配置都是如此，无论是我的I5和750，还是其他主播的I7和1070。所以游戏应该是有内存泄漏或者显存泄漏存在，类似于泰坦之旅。当年我用256M内存的机子玩TQ，玩一段时间卡，十几年后，看到有人在知道求助，I7+32G还是一样卡。内存泄漏问题不解决，多高配置都一样卡。
其次，游戏在切换界面、载入等时候，经常陷入假死状态。可能是因为我的配置比较低，但是我强撸巫师3和黑魂3的时候，都没有这种情况。直播的时候，点退出游戏的时候真假死了，没有响应，强制结束进程。退完游戏我整台电脑卡了近5分钟，动弹不得，仿佛回到32M内存时代。

先把内存泄漏解决了！

2.BUG。
有BUG很正常，但是一些令人想删游戏的BUG，最好是能够充分测试一下。
第一次，教程叫我改税率，但是税率按钮锁着，教程中又无法SL，GG，重开。
第二次，建了个新的行政区，攒了点钱想建个高中，一看不太支持，取消了，结果行政区一瞬间没了！钱全打水漂了，不久就GG了。
第三次，地图上的行政区按钮点不了，两个区都一样。想SL，竟然存不了档（这个后面讲），GG。
……
感觉游戏在按钮事件响应的代码逻辑上，大有问题。我以前是程序员，也在游戏公司干过，所以能猜个大概。

比如我点A按钮，到底响不响应，响应什么，应该是由后台逻辑来进行最终判断的。
而游戏却太依赖前台按钮的状态。
比如教程里叫我改税率，但是按钮由于卡或者什么原因，没有由锁定状态变成可用状态，于是就直接卡关了。
正常逻辑下，按钮锁定或者可按，应该只是一个表现。具体按下后做什么，还是要根据实际情况判断。假设界面上由于卡，应该可按的税率是锁定的，但是实际点击后，后台逻辑判断通过，仍然处理逻辑，就不会卡关。可是游戏直接就不处理，自然四处卡按钮。
我经常遇到按钮按了没反应的问题，扶持，移平，新建，改建，提交等，应该都是同类型问题。

很遗憾，游戏在前台界面与后台逻辑之间的处理，还处于新手阶段。就像某些软件禁用功能，只是简单的把按钮变灰，这时候用工具把按钮变成Enable就行了……

3.交互。
刚才说到，竟然存不了档。
为啥呢？后来看到STEAMCN的贴子，原来是存档的时候，要手动输入文件名。
存档需要文件名这个没有问题，有问题的是游戏的处理方式。

游戏默认没有文件名，所以直接存存不了。
而玩家点击储存之后，没有任何的一个反馈，就是点了没反应。
此时，不是应该弹出一个提示：请输入文件名吗？
被玩家差评最多的，各种按钮图标啥的不明所以，点了不知道做啥用，或者该干啥，都是此类问题。

很遗憾，游戏在人机交互方面，做得简直还不如一个新手。就算是新手程序员，编个算式程序，输非数字的时候，总该提示“请输入数字”，而不是没有任何反应吧？

4.事件系统。
这类游戏的事件系统，本应该成为一种随机的惊喜或者乱数，但是实际表现却相当一般。

如何一般？
首先，游戏本身就没有多少事件。我玩了几次，都是一样的流程，第一个儿子健康成长，第二个老婆不生。后面玩到第三阶段，连出了四次，四次啊，四次同样的事件，就是那个神父啥的事件。
其次，同样的事件，你的选择竟然能得到同样的结果。那个神父事件，四次我都选了劝说，结果完完全全一模一样。

这样的话，事件选择不但不再具有策略性，甚至已经失去了选择的意义，而是变成纯背版。就像你玩大富翁，扔骰子和命运屋的结果不再是随机，那还有趣吗？

5.核心玩法。
游戏最大的问题，就是核心玩法的乏味。

游戏弱化了城市建设的玩法，你不再需要一个一个的摆建筑，造路，而是在更高的，规划的层面上，去规划整个区域。
相对的，你需要在议会里跟不同政党扯皮。
就相当于，你不再是项目经理，要去跟进各个细节，而是公司CEO，从宏观方面引领公司发展。

这本来是一个很好的玩法创意，玩家如何一边跟不同党派周旋，一边建设好城市。
但是实际表现却相当一般。
玩家要做的，就是在提案不通过的时候，通过消耗好感度，来换取支持度，没了。
真的没了。

稍微有点区别的，就是你所使用的方法，恳求，要求，威胁？
这些选择有什么区别呢？
只是你消耗N点好感度，换取M点支持度的区别，没了。
真的没了。
比如有一次我威胁整个党派，用5点好感换了9点支持。下次，我好感已经是负的，于是就只好要求他们支持，用2点好感换了2点支持。
然后就没了。

其实这部分可以丰富成很好的一个玩法的。
比如，我在怼议会的时候，有见到这么一个选项：多数市民支持该观点！
那么该选项应该发挥以下作用：
如果提案确实是多数市民支持的，那么党派的支持度应该大幅提高，这是基础。
再进一步，该党派由于跟多数市民对着干，他的支持度下降了。
再进一步，其他党派见状，自动提高了对该提案的支持度，不用我再去一个一个怼。
再进一步，因为我替市民说话，市民的幸福指数增加了，对我的支持度增加了。
再进一步，由于此事件，其他亲民党派对我的好感度也自动增加了，但是强硬党派对我的好感可能会有所下降。
反过来，如果该提案多数市民不支持，我仍然选择该选项，则只会收到该党派的嘲笑。

仅此一个选项，进行这么一点小小的改动，游戏的可玩性就可以有翻好几倍的期望。可见游戏目前在此方面的玩法有多么匮乏。

6.投票系统。
大家也看到了，我们在游戏里做任何事件，都需要投票。
投票就导致我们需要怼议会。
怼议会由于第5点所述，就变得很无聊。

我们就是等钱，有钱了就建东西。
建不起来就怼议会，花好感度买。
好感度不够就再等，等它自动回复。
万一财政是负的，那就想办法加税。

没了。

游戏还有另一条路，就是私人资金。但是私人资金太少，杯水车薪。
我曾有一次在第一时间，就把市长工资加到了最高，实际也没啥用。我攒了好久才攒个几百K，后面随便建个东西要1500K。

其实，看美国大选也知道。政客背后都有一整个政党和财团在支持着的。而本游戏里，好像是我们一个人和全世界为敌一样……
建议游戏应该改一下，设一个支持玩家的政党或者财团，这样才不会天天坐着等钱等好感。

超长，第7点放评论里

以上，目前就想到这里。写这些只是希望能帮助开发团队把游戏做好，毕竟游戏基础的创意部分是不错的。如果对玩法设计、代码逻辑、人机交互方面有想法，欢迎交流，优酷和搜狐视频空间“波导终结者”，斗鱼2918房每天下午直播。",

Urban Empires is an okay game. It seriously lacks depth once you bite into it and the developers didn't really put much attention into making sure that multiple play styles are competitive. At the end of the day the ""best"" move is to just go fully socialist liberal since almost all related edicts are totally positive anyway. I'm willing to bet that the overwhelmiongly positive effects that liberal and leftists edicts give is at least partially based on the developers own political opinions. There should be multiple feasible paths to victory even if you don't agree politically. Such a shame really.

Gay rights? Yes. Feminism? Of course! The bonuses are too good to pass. Same for child labor, women's rights, LGBT rights, etc. Rinse and repeat. I get that many of us support these things in real life but in a game each choice needs to have benefits and flaws. The game rewards progressive ideas by removing all flaws.

Furthermore the political parties are nothing more than a simple resource system. They have no agency or personality of their own. The other ""players"" in the game lack any sense of reason behind their choices. They don't have any clearly seen agenda and this hurts the game immenseley. Yes liberals are more likely to vote for more taxes and conservatives are more likely to oppose them but that's as far as the depth goes. 

My last point focuses on events and the world at large. As you play, diffferent events come to pass on the world stage but ultimatley it doesn't matter what you do or how you react. It always plays out the same way with no real consequences for choices or outcomes of events. It doesn't matter if you support independence or not because at the end of the day it all disappears without explanation when you move to the next era. I didn't even realize we got independence until I saw some random screen with a reference. It didn't even matter. This happens with every event tied to the larger world.

TLDR: The developers hit on a great concept and if the game was 10 bucks I'd say they nailed it as far as liberal progressive SJW style games go. At 40.00 dollars we deserve far more depth and far more meaningful choices/options.

I also enjoy the deep-dive you can do on stats.  At one point in the year 1914, I discovered that my town of ~3000 people had a whopping 22 movie theaters, and the number one employer of middle class citizens?  Movie production companies.  I'm a burgeoning Hollywood!

The biggest minus is that the game frequently freezes on my laptop, AND THERE IS NO AUTOSAVE ABILITY.  I have to remember to manually save every year or so.

Also, a lot of things are unexplained in the game...even in the tutorial...but I liked trying to learn as I went along.  

I will say I was disappointed to see that things like electricity and plumbing didn't really change the look of my city.  In fact, the technological advances don't seem to actually advance technology at all.  People in my city were driving cars before we discovered the combustible engine which unlocks the automobile.  My entire city was on the telephone grid before we had electricity.  Perhaps most egregious, my character had to win re-election before citizens actually had the right to vote.

公共服务的投入与产出不成正比，使得除了增加行政区以外所有操作几乎都没有意义。如果玩家试图按照生活常识去进行游戏，城市经济就会立刻陷入麻烦，最好的情况是仅能勉强维持现状。举例而言，研发出电力，进入电气时代，你以为自己治下的城市经济要腾飞了？实际上这时你的财政收入根本负担不起发电厂和电网设施，攒钱建了，你的财政收入也不会有什么增长，这只是整个游戏的一个缩影：一切看起来有趣的事情都没有现实性，什么都不做反而能平稳通关。

除了游戏本身，这个游戏还算有趣：文本风趣，各个家族的故事看得出来也是花了心思的，报纸系统让时代感非常强烈，然而这些都不能弥补数值系统的失败，让这个游戏几乎完全不可玩！

- доволі незрозуміла і незбалансована економічна система;
- всього 3 карти, та й з тими незрозуміло, як вони впливають на розвиток міста;
- рандомні івенти можна легко пропустити - не завадив би хоч якийсь звук-повідомлення;

Aus den inzwischen knapp 5h Spielzeit kann ich sagen, das Game macht echt Laune. Vom Schwierigkeitsgrad her finde ich das Spiel gerade richtig, speziell am Anfang ist es nicht zu leicht. Man muss erst rausfinden zu welchem Zeitpunkt man sich gewisse Dinge leisten kann und welche die höchste Priorität haben. Ich habe dort das ein oder andere Mal etwas danebengegriffen, konnte es jedoch immer wieder ausbügeln. Fehlentscheidungen werfen einen meist zwar zurück, sind jedoch nicht der definitive Todesstoß und das finde ich gut. Die ein oder andere Verordnung und ein neuer Bezirk mit Mühe und Not durch den Stadtrat geprügelt und die Stadtkasse schreibt wieder grüne Zahlen. Meiner Meinung nach gibt es eigentlich immer etwas das man noch Bauen und umsetzen möchte. Durch die verschiedenen Forschungen kommen auch laufend neue Möglichkeiten hinzu was den Spielfluss fördert und die Motivationsspirale antreibt. Nur noch schnell das hier erweitern… 
Grafisch finde ich das Spiel sehr gelungen, passt sehr gut zur Atmosphäre. Auch performancetechnisch kann ich mich aktuell nicht beklagen, wobei ich dazusagen muss dass ich hauptsächlich auf 1x und 2x Geschwindigkeit spiele. Aktuell kann ich das Spiel auf jeden Fall weiterempfehlen, macht super viel Spaß.

Wer sich einen Eindruck verschaffen möchte bevor er bei dem doch eher hoch angesetzten Preis zuschlagen will, kann gerne hier vorbei schauen und herausfinden ob einen selbst das Fieber packt =)

Переубидить их у вас не получится, разогнать гордской совет - тоже. Вы подчиняетесь игре, плывете по течению. Есть какие-то события, однообразные, ваш выбор - не важен.  

Короче говоря, суть игры в том, чтобы строить районы(выбрать область и несколько раз кликнуть мышкой)  и пытаться переубедить партии (хотя этого можно и не делать).

Noch weniger Nachvollziehen kann ich die Wirtschaftsimulation und die damit verbundenen Geldeinnahmen/-ausgaben. Mal bin ich ein paar tausend im Plus, mal mehrere tausend im Minus. Warum das so ist, bzw. warum es sich plötzlich geändert hat, kann ich meistens nicht nachvollziehen. Auch fehlt mir oftmals etwas die vorraussicht der Parteein. So wollte ich bspw. einen Bahnhof bauen, welcher unter anderem für wirtschaftlichen Aufschwung sorgt. Natürlich ist sowas recht teuer und ja, zu dem Zeitpunkt waren die Kassen nicht randvoll gefüllt. Aber mit etwas wirtschaftlicher Voraussicht könnte man eine solche Investition gut tätigen, um die Wirtschaft und die damit einhergehenden Einnahmen langfristig zu steigern. Nun leider interpretiert das Spiel die Situation etwas anders und hat mir die Genehmigung der Parteien verweigert.

Ami jó:
- Saját város! Kialakíthatsz kerületeket, viszonylag a játék elejétől már meghatározhatod, hogy milyen típusú lehet. Amit észben kell tartani, hogy amíg van szabad terület, inkább széltében kell terjeszkedni, mert felfelé nagyon drága az út.. és kicsit ködös is.

- Politika.. Nem garázdálkodhatsz szabadon, el kell fogadtatni a kedves képviselőkkel. Egy idő után rájön az ember, hogy annyira nem vészesen nehéz őket kordában tartani, csak ne utáljanak meg valami miatt. Utána lesheted, hogy rád szavazzanak.

- Döntések terhe.. Minden, amit tesz az ember, hatással van az egész városra. Emelsz egy százalékot és az üzletek már nem termelnek profitot.. 

Ami hibádzik: 
- ..és nem tudsz rájönni, hogy miért, mivel a kereslet baromi nagy az üzletek iránt, de mégis haldokolnak

- 'Medium' területeken a lakóházak fejlődni kezdenek, az üzletek nem. Akkor sem ha kifejezetten nagy lenne rá az igény. Ezt még nem sikerült megfejteni.

- Túl kicsi kerület.. Kicsit bosszantó, mikor már csak adott helyed van, de nem elég egy kerületre.. 

- Hirtelen változnak az igények. Két korszak közt annyi az átmenet, hogy kapunk egy új karaktert, akit csak képről látunk, plusz az igények úgy megnőnek hogy csak pislog az ember.. egy szilveszter alatt.. 

- A szavazások várható kimenetelét egy-egy akciónk után (valamely párttal való interakció) nem képes normálisan jelezni, csak ha a szavazatot újra megnyitja az ember.

- Mentett állás visszatöltése után hibásan számolja a bevételt, ami egy kezdetleges, alacsony fenntartási költségű városnál még nem annyira nagy probléma, de egy nagyobbnál kapásból minusz kétmillió lesz az egyenleg, amit nem olyan egyszerű egyenesbe hozni.. Valószínű, amíg ezt a hibát nem javítják, nem fektetek be több időt, egyszerűen felesleges.

- Förtelmesen nagy a gépigény és nem tudtam rájönni, hogy miért.. Nem csúnya, de nem is egetrengető a grafika, a processzor és videokártya ventillátorok meg csak úgy visítanak.

- Ha mindezektől eltekintenénk, akkor is baromi túlárazott lenne. Egyszerűen nem tud annyit nyújtani, ami megér ennyi pénzt. Talán 20-25eurós vonalban rendben lenne.

Ezen az áron sajnos ezt nem tudom ajánlani. Előrendelőként olcsóbb volt, de sajnos csak egy újabb bizonyíték, hogy nem szabad semmit előre megvenni. Majd ha van néhány olyan madár mint én és megírja, hogy jó, vagy sem..",

- political options are limited and no clear cause and effect.
- money is impossible (raise tax and no-one cares, industry going bush with 0% tax rate???)

- income changing for no understandable reason, and therefore imposible the take corrective action

- Once your past the first era tech tree improvements have little to no impact.

diferente dos outros simuladores que já joguei, aqui você é o prefeito da cidade, e como qualquer prefeito, não pode fazer o que quiser, pois está subordinado a um conselho.

para quem gosta apenas de construir cidades se preocupando somente com o dinheiro, este jogo não é recomendado! para ter sucesso aqui você terá que convencer o conselho das suas decisões, como por exemplo: construir uma delegacia de policia, escola, bombeiros, mudar o tipo de ruas de um distrito... entre outros.

O jogo se baseia em distritos (bairros) cabendo a você escolher como ele funciona: infra estrutura( iluminação, abastecimento de água, segurança, saúde, escolas....) e com isso vai favorecer uma determinada classe economica (e obviamente enfurecer outra). O jogo possui partidos, estes que defendem ideais diferentes. Portanto, cada escolha vai influenciar no quão dificil vai ser aprovar algo com o conselho.

The concept of this game is a great one in my opinion, though the execution is somewhat questionable:

1. Grab that Cash and Make a Stash. The biggest issue is value for money, $43CAD is a bit steep for the amount of content you get, compared to the likes of lets say Facturio, which is $25CAD. 

2. Same Day Different Ruler. I'w done playthroughs with all the different families and all of their events are scripted and always the same, there is no variation to the outcomes of the same options when you decide on an event. Furthermore the different families play pretty much the same in general with little variations.

3. Click and Wait, Click and Wait! The Council is more of an annoyance than a great game mechanic at this point. It lacks any depth whatsoever. There is little consequence in pissing off your rivals. If “good will” goes negative the only thing is that your pleas/demands/threats have less of an effect. As opposed to, when threatened, causing massive opposition from them, this seems to not happen. Furthermore there is no interaction with the parties on the council other than the voting.

4. Information Boogaloo...Though the game has a myriad of info screens, it somewhat lacks the ability to give you necessary information. You have no way of knowing why businesses are doing poorly or why there are problems in certain areas. The game has lots of visual cues that tell you something is wrong or happening, but nothing to indicate why or what. This is a problem since now you have very little info to figure out how to solve it.

5. Flash Ahaaa, Fastest in the Universe. The pacing seems to be a bit off, you can breeze through the 5 eras in 2-3h or so. This makes the game more of a race to the finish rather than a sit down and rule your city type of deal, if I were to compare it to Crusader Kings II.     

6. Rule and Drool. Since all the events seem to be scripted and there is no randomness or variety in the outcomes of your decisions, the ruling aspect of the game gets old quite quick. Which is a big problem since the ruling mechanic is the main focus of the game. To add insult to injury there is very little to do: plop down a district, raise/lower taxes and pass a few edicts...that's pretty much it. There is very little political intrigue. You can spy on parties, but the result is the same, you get dirt and use it to get the party to vote in your favor...again not a lot of depth.

7. Mayor the Useless. Your character is a bit useless, though you get some bonuses here and there... there is again no depth or necessity for it, unlike Crusader Kings, where your ruler has a major impact on your country's well being.

In conclusion the idea is great, but this game lacks any sort of depth whatsoever. Couple it with the $43CAD price tag and value for money isn't there! It's sad, as these types of games are my forte, was hoping for a more complex city RULER rather than a mobile esque clicker. 

The game has a lot of potential, it just needs to be taped. Maybe with steamworks support and a lot of DLC this could evolve into something great. We shall see what becomes of it. 

If you want a city builder - this is not it.

I like this game. It's an interesting new way of dealing with cities and politics. It's in no way a city builder since most of the time you can't build the city you want ( adding to both appeal and frustration of the game - but that's politics ). There are many ways to get way you want though and trying to mayor through the era's it's quit interesting to see how it all develops. 

There seem to be enough replayability trying different strategies ( high taxes vs low taxes, high level of services vs laissez-faire etc ) . 

The main problems are connected with a lack of explanation ( why is a district developing or not is hardly explained ) and not always clear what the choices are the game is trying you to have.  Also hopefully the dev's will look a little at the performance which drops in the later game.

Wer sich einen Stadtbau Sim wie Sim City erwartet - falsch
Wer sich eine Diktator Sim wie Tropico erwartet - falsch

es ist eine Mischung aus beiden, jedoch nur im Ansatz.

Lange Rede kurzer Sinn:
Pros:
- Tolle Idee ein neues Genre zu kreieren.
- Guter Ansatz mit diversen Parteien im Stadtrat
- Zusammenhang mit realen Geschichtlichen Ereignissen

Cons:
- Eigene Entscheidungen haben nur sehr wenig Einfluss in der Politik
- alles nur Budget abhängig
- keine verschiedenen Schwierigkeitsgrade
- nicht nachvllziehbare Wahlergebnisse
- oft wiederholende Events

Netter Ansatz jedoch meiner Meinung nach lieber auf einen Sale und paar Patches Warten.

----

Man definiert Bezirke, diese sind unterteilt in 3 Arten. 
Wohnen
Gewerbe
Industrie

Mehr Einwohner, mehr Gewerbe, mehr Industrie = mehr Steuern = mehr Einnahmen

und da kommen wir auch schon zu meiner Kritik:
Der Ansatz mit den diversen politischen Parteien ist sehr gut, jedoch schlecht umgesetzt.
Ist das Budget der Stadt in Ordnung, wird so gut wie allem zugestimmt.
Ist es das nicht wird jeder Steuererhöhung zugestimmt.

Die Zusammenhänge in der Stadtentwicklung und dadurch die diversen Wählerströme ist nicht nachvollziehbar.

Genau so wenig werden immer Prognosen für diverse Entscheidungen angezeigt, die wirklichkeit spricht dann plötzlich komplett dagegen...

Somit konzentriert man sich auf Dauer nur darauf sein Budget in den grünen Zahlen zu halten und die Zeit laufen zu lassen.

Es passieren sehr viele kleine und große Events, besonders die kleinen Wiederholen sich jedoch schon sehr häufig.

[b] 以下全部是我个人主观看法，仅供参考[/b]

[h1] 优化：[/h1] [i] 4.5/10	[/i]
    刚进游戏就发现略卡，我的E5/1060应该不会出这个问题啊，游戏过程中还时不时出现卡顿，经过多方求证，确实优化不是很好。而且每次读档或新开档的时候loading的时间略长(第一次创建新游戏的时候，竟然loading了大概3分钟左右)，貌似不只有我有这个问题。大多数时候都是，建档的时候卡死，保存的时候卡死，读档的时候卡死，退游戏的时候卡死。

[h1] 画面：[/h1] [i] 8/10	[/i]
    画面还是熟悉的风格，然而，真的没有进步太多。不过原画很棒这点没的说！
    [spoiler] 除此之外还有熟悉的水表[/spoiler]

[h1] 设计：[/h1] [i] 6/10	[/i]
    1、虽然城市议会这个设定很棒，然而随机性是不是有点过大了呢？而且投票流程基本不可控，最重要的是，明明是恳求，却还扣支持度，这就真的不是很懂了。总体感觉“恳求”“要求”“威胁”这三个选项实在是有点鸡肋，不用看支持率，这仨随便点，涨多张少是个缘，这样有的时候真的很恼。
    2、虽然海岛大亨也是一座小岛，虽然天际线的建造区域也是一片区域，大多数这种游戏的建造区域都是有限的范围，但是这游戏在建造范围的圈画以及整个“地图”的实际上真是有点蛋疼，建造范围不好圈画，地图边界也十分蛋疼。
    3、然后关于“城市”与“帝国”这个方面，真的不如海岛大亨。“城市”方面基本上没有建造城市的过程，这种游戏建造游戏不是才是最大的乐趣之一吗？然而，这个游戏在建造自己的城市的过程中并没有感受到乐趣，没有属于自己的规划，只有笼统的统化，比起作为一名市长，更像一名幕后的操盘手，然而这双手还不一定听自己的，有种说不出的烦。如果说，这个游戏的重点在“帝国”上的话，可能“帝国”方面就仅限于在发明这方面有点像所谓的“帝国”了。比起海岛大亨那种小城国，感觉这游戏里的“国”更像一座城市，不痛不痒的“外交”机制，几乎可以忽略不计的国际事件，并没有让我感受到“帝国”，而“城市”又做的四不像，总体给我的感觉就是个四不像的模拟建造经营游戏。

[h1] 游戏性/可玩性/玩法：[/h1][i] 7/10	[/i]
    1、游戏性还不错，就是有点被动，总感觉有力使不出，被人压着，可能制作组设计“城市议会”就是为了让玩家体验一下当市长也并非一家独大的感觉。但是这样会有一种能者多劳，劳者并不多得的感觉，缺少成就感，而且太过于被动了，以至于后期忘了该怎么主动。总体感觉游戏性不是很高，至少在目前市面上的这些模拟经营建造类游戏中，不是很高。
    2、缺少难度分级，没有沙盒模式，而且不能自己设置初始条件。③虽然随机事件很多，大多也都很有趣，但是重复性也很高，反而在一些本来应该可控的机制里（城市议会）随机性过高。
    3、首先我要称赞的是“主线”很棒！家族随时代而传承以及每代市长各自的“剧情”，但是如果如果上一代“我”的选择可以影响下一代的性格“我”就好了。或者设置一些在“我”孩提时代的事件的选择，会影响下一个时代“我”成年成为市长后的一些事件。
    4、我个人感觉这个游戏整体的节奏很差，具体我也说不出来，“有时手忙脚乱，有时无事可做”这种现象在这种游戏上经常出现，但这个游戏给我的感觉完全不是这样。我玩这个游戏手忙脚乱的时候就感觉很烦躁，无事可做的时候感觉很空虚，这种感觉我也说不上来，但我确定确实是这个游戏的过程给我带来的感受。
    5、战役的线性让我有一种在刷RPG游戏的任务的感觉，或许应该加强一些任务后续随机性和设计一些国际性的地区性的突发事件（战争、灾难等），当“我”想做出一个选择的时候，单单的选项和影响/后果是远远不够的。

[h1] 音乐：[/h1] [i] 7/10	[/i]
    音乐确实不错，然而每次都是很突兀的转换，我实在不能打太高的分。

[h1] 其他：	[/h1][i] 7.5/10	[/i]
    中文好评！配音好评！中文配音好评！发明研究结束后的那个旁白不要太棒！9/10
    操作方面，初始操作不是很友好，但是很快就能适应，感觉还不错，但是不如全视角都用鼠标右键调来的方便快捷，尤其是QE很难用。7/10
    选项的按键设计的有点小了。而且数据条只能滑动调整，不能输入数值也没有左右调整的按钮，对于我这种强迫症来说，要调一个精确地1%得调好久。6/10
    界面UI很漂亮。8/10

[h1] 整体得分：[/h1] [i] 6.5/10	[/i]
[b]有模拟，有经营，有建造，有城市，有国家，然而是个四不像，没有哪一项做的精，也没有哪一项做的亮。游戏的风格很棒（原画、音乐，设计），然而瑜不遮瑕，只能算是及格。[/b]

This one is unconfirmed since I have to play more eras to check this out, but from my current two eras gameplay I've got the feeling that game tries to push you into the leftist way with all these labour rights/equality and other commie stuff (I'm a right-wing conservative myself).

Цена определённо завышена - при имеющемся уровне графики и механиках, напоминающих сильно упрощённую ""Демократию"" с небольшими элементами цивилизации и микроскопическими - от СимСити, 700 рублей - это дороговато. Кроме того, чрезмерная сложность/легкость  (слабый баланс), обилие досадных глюков вроде исчезающих при модернизации фонарей, здания, которые ""строятся"" прямо сквозь другие здания - все это говорит об общей недоработанности игры.

Из особенностей: 

1. Возможность наблюдать за развитием города в 200-летний период. Это первая игра, в которой это заявление действительно применимо. В зависимости от уровня развития меняется стиль новых зданий (но не старых), появляются новые опции развития районов и города в целом, меняются потребности горожан и политические партии, заседающие в совете. Правда, будьте готовы к тому, что по вашим грунтовым дорогам в 1870 году будут разъезжать автомобили, а в 1930 на вокзал будут приходить тепловозы - все эти погрешности по-прежнему на месте, как и в любых ""исторических"" играх.

2. Акцент не на строительстве, а на управлении городом. Пусть вас не обманывает ""градостроительный"" облик. Это просто оболочка. На самом деле перед вами типичная экономическая стратегия с кучей ресурсов и хитро высчитанным бюджетом, который зависит даже не столько от ваших экономических умений, сколько от эпохи и мирового экономического кризиса, числа гомосексуалистов, а также популярности пивных баров среди населения.   Модель интересная, но есть множество мелких и крупных проблем. Невозможность понять, почему у тебя вдруг баланс из +200К стал -150К, бесит. К слову, это первая игра ""Tropico-стайл"", где жителей, как таковых, нет. То, что бродит по улицам, не больше, чем декорация.

3. Элементы РПГ прямиком из Тропико. Правда, получилось больше похоже на ""Европу"" или там ""Крестоносцев"" - персонаж на следующую эпоху обрастает характеристиками под влиянием политики своего предшественника.

4. Возможность управлять маленькой унылой деревней  с грунтовыми дорогами и отсутствием освещения в некоторых районах в самой середине 1950х. А всё потому, что слишком много денег вбухивал в модернизацию центрального района, в котором в итоге никто и не живёт. 

5. Права женщин и ЛГБТ. Коммунисты, голосующие против сокращения рабочего дня. Югославия, угрожающая захватить вашу деревню. И тупая машина, которая постоянно путает имя вашего мэра и название города, названия партий и прочее.

6. Всякие прикольные исторические события. Типа мирового кризиса и моровой язвы. 

7. На самом деле как и в Тропико можно держать город в полной дупе, и при этом регулярно переизбираться. В городе одна школа, ни одной больницы, грунтовые, мать их, дороги, налоги под 40% и беспредел на улицах. Но коммунисты и соц. демы, феминистки и геи любят вас, милорд, а потому и голосуют. Остальных запугиваем. 

8. Есть трамчик (а ещё метро и автобусы), но на них в моей деревне денег не было. Да и трафика не было. Грунтовые дороги почти везде справлялись и так.

9. После выхода в главное меню зачастую слетает перевод. Очень странно.

10. А, о чём это я? Ну да, неплохая игра. Но я-таки рекомендую дождаться скидки.

I did not experience any breaking bugs, however the performance of the game got worse drastically in the late game, if you play on speed four on default settings. My rig is beyond the recommended specs with an I7 and a Geforce 980ti."

Ich habe mich Monate lang auf das Spiel gefreut und jetzt tatsächlich Vollpreis gezahlt.
Leider ist das Spiel aber an allen Ecken ein Rohling.
Der Stil ist zwar im Grunde wunderschön, wenn man über schwebendes Gras hinwegsieht und die Tatsache, dass sich durch Lücken und ungünstige Modellkonstellationen nicht so richtig Straßenzüge bilden, wodurch das Stadtbild etwas lieblos hingewürfelt wirkt. Oder Flaggen, die in unterschiedliche Richtungen wehen. Oder etwas leblose Straßen. Viele Kleinigkeiten eben.
Das Spielkonzept ist trotzdem toll und hat viel Potential.

Das eigentliche Problem ist die Sinnlosigkeit des Forschungs- und Entwicklungsbaumes.
Die Zusammenhänge, warum sich gewisse Errungenschaften bedingen, werden nicht ganz klar. So schaltet die Erfindung der Fotografie Möbelgeschäfte und Theater frei; Kirchen und Schuhläden gibt es erst mit der Erfindung des Telegrafen; um ""Verbrennung"" (Motoren) zu erforschen braucht man Vertretungsrechte etc.
Die politischen Standpunkte der Parteien passen auch oft nicht zu ihrer eigentlichen Position im politischen Spektrum.
Dann tauchen in Pen-And-Paper-Manier zufällige Ereignisse auf, die eine politische Positionierung verlangen mit teils weitreichenden Folgen. Die Reaktionsmöglichkeiten sind dabei sehr unbefriedigend.
Gerade wurde in meiner Stadt von Arbeitern gestreikt und ich kann mich jetzt entscheiden, ob ich den deshalb aufgebrachten Konservativen entgegenbringe, a) sie hätten das Recht, b) es sei gerechtfertigt oder c) sie sollten mehr Rechte bekommen. Alles drei kommt eigentlich aus dem selben Spektrum, ist quasi die selbe Antwort.
Es fehlen gegenteilige Aussagen, wie ein feudalistisches ""die sollen sich nicht anmaßen, Dinge zu beurteilen, die ihrem Verstand entschweben"" oder ein neoliberales ""ihre Forderungen gefährden den freien Markt"" o.ä.
So kommt gar kein befriedigendes Gefühl von ""ich habe mich für die Rechte der Sozial Benachteiligten eingesetzt"" auf.
Ich hatte gar keine Wahl.
Zuletzt fehlen oft Beschreibungen zu Buttons bzw. ploppen bei manchen einfach nicht auf.

Alles in allem wirkt es, als seinen die Scripte in langen Nachtschichten geschrieben worden und voller Lücken und Fehler.

首先作为一个模拟类游戏爱好者尝试了许多模拟类型的游戏，但是将城市建造和政治运营深度结合的游戏还是非常新颖的，当时看了介绍很期待就预购了
结果到手之后感觉非常失望，优化什么的就不说了
1.城市建造的自由度太低，比如我的城市工业需求很高住宅和商业需求很低，我不能单独建一个工业区，必须规划新区，单一城区的类型分布也只能靠百分比来调不能手动设置。
2.经济系统混乱，极其容易陷入死循环，比如公共服务设施建多了导致预算赤字，就算城市各种需求都很高但因为预算问题议会不会批准任何新建请求，只有提高税率才能提高收入，税率一高各种需求就降低，经济发展停滞甚至倒退，再陷入赤字，再提高税率，进入死循环。而且日志总会提醒某某行业迅速发展某某行业陷入瓶颈，但是在其他地方根本看不出来，感觉没有任何意义。
3.新鲜的议会系统成为鸡肋，运营议会的方式太少，很难从宏观上改变民众的政见，只是党派间的请求要求威胁，而且有些党派会提出你不想通过的法律，但你却不能运用自己的手段让法律通过不了，后期繁多的党派也失去了游戏性，成为了鸡肋。
4.迷之UI，特别是新手教程对UI的指引非常混乱，而且在任何时候按exc键不是退出当前界面（比如改造区域）而是进入菜单，感觉非常不顺手

2.如果开发小组有目标将游戏性放在政党和法案上的

However this title was a serious disappointment to me, and coming from a big publisher behind the likes of Tropico, it really needed to be better.

In short Urban Empire is a political simulator, but the sad fact is it never really lives up to that in any meaningful way. All the parties I encountered, despite being placed in what seemed to be a realistic way upon the political spectrum, ended up having little to differentiate each other. With enough bargaining ( the game lets you plead, demand or threaten to change party member's stances on a vote) every party could be persuaded to accept a vote. In two hours of play I lost one vote, and that was because by that time I couldn't really care less about pushing any harder.

This game has potential, but currently it feels highly random. I played for two hours and in that time I rarely felt like there were any major differences between the political parties, other than the fact that the game's scripting told them how they should vote on an issue. The social democrats always seemed to disagree, and need to be persuaded, where as the physiocratics always agreed whole heartedly. By the end of my two hours I was sadly bored stiff.

You might say two hours is a short time, but I saw the second era and I put through quite a number of votes and city infrastructure changes, but by the end of those two hours I felt distinctly like I was (to quote someone else) 'pulling levers and watching how it changed things'. Between votes I would just sit and watch the city, and in the long run it all came down to budget, and a procedure of picking edicts to increase income and forcing votes to up the taxes.

I just couldn't be bothered to force any more votes or try an more edicts because I simpky felt like this 'balancing act' was all I'd be doing for 4 eras. Then, much to my annoyance, I tried to save my city only to find the game wouldn't let me. It appears that unless you have finished all tutorial missions then you can't save. I'm sure that's a bug that will be fixed, but it didn't improve my first impressions of Urban Empire at the time.

Urban Empire is a nice idea, but I feel it lacks too much depth to make it a game I'd recommend to people. I watched much of the game on YouTube before release, and I pre-purchased based on my thoughts. It had looked fun from watching, but playing was not the same experience.

If Urban Empire only had half the humour and detail of Tropico it may have allowed me to get past the monotony of the political system (yes, I do feel it was monotonous), and indeed the only attempt at humour was a reference to Tropico (which I won't spoil). It was a nice touch, but didn't improve on things.

For the first time I feel inclined to refund a title, and for that reason I can't recommend Urban Empire. There is a game here should the developers act to add in a layer atop the political bargaining. An ability to design the layout of your city would be a start, and frankly that is another thing that stopped me finding any real enjoyment in the game. If I could have done a mayor's job and planned the layout of my city, then I might have had something to do whilst waiting for votes to pass and balances to improve. But for some reason the city builds itself, or you at least have no say in road layout and rci placement. You can determine how much industry, commercial and residential is built, but not where. It's almost as if you're playing the role of a mayor with lots of helpers turned on to leave you less to do. You're just public relations for the mayor, really.","I rarely like to post negative reviews for a title, instead liking to offer encouragement and critical appraisal for developers.

If the performance wasn't so god-awful it could be a fun game, if a bit silly and random in its political simulation... But if I can't actually play the game, well, not much fun to be had.

Let's take it step-by-step:

1. Politics.
Fun idea. Fun when it works properly, but often it doesn't. The political compass doesn't translate into sensible parties (sensible as in resembling reality to some degree), and there is no way to tell how you are being placed on that compass... you might think you are a left-leaning liberal, but when mayoral elections come along, all the right-wing centrists support you, and the progressives are the ones that vote against you. Why? No way to find out.
Nevertheless, if you suspend your disbelief, and have don't expect the compass to be anything remotely realistic, it is an interesting barrier mechanic you have to work your way around... Devs should just throw out the realistic names and connotations, and just run with the underlying mechanics.

2. UI and useability
UI itself is decent, if a little action heavy (too many clicks to accomplish some things) not too hard to use, or learn. The problem is there is a big lack of feedback and general information about what is gonig on in the city, and what the consequences of your actions are. 
*Why is the restaurant industry making more money than the next 10 combined, while not having a sales boost or booming demand? No clue. 
*Why are the elite and lower classes unemployed? No clue, the industry tabs only shows middle and working class jobs per category. 
*Why are all these businesses bankrupt in this one district, but not in the one next to it? No clue... I can look at all of them individually, but it only tells me the current situation, not any of the causes.
*Incomprehensible tooltips galore, where figuring out if the +5% figure on a red downwards-arrow accompanied icon is a good thing or not is a matter of trial-and-error. 
*Some decisions in events have no tooltip, but if the previous choice had one, it remains displayed, confusing the player. 

3. Variety and replayability:
Barely any of either. Game is fairly linear, with far too few choices. 
*A grand total of 3 maps are present currently, but since the maps make no difference in how the game plays, there might as well be 300. One of the maps states that the mining industry would be a defining economic force, due to mountains and such... well, that does not in any way translate into game mechanics. I tried all three maps, and had pretty much the exact same industry composition on all of them.
* The 4 families are fun additions, they can make you play somewhat differently. Good idea, expand upon this.

4. And the big bugbear, Performance:
*Specs: i5-4670 @3.4GHz. GF970, 16GB-1866 RAM, 256GB SSD.
*Scenario 1: max quality 1080p, 1914, city of 45K people, era 3 techs all unlocked.
*Result 1: 2-16 FPS on 2x speed, 5-22 on 1x speed, 10-15 second freezes every 3-4 months. Unplayable on higher speeds (freezes every couple seconds).

*Scenario 2: lowest quality 1080p, 1914, city of 45K people, era 3 techs all unlocked.
*Result 2: 15-25 FPS on 2x speed, 20-30 on 1x speed, 5-10 second freezes every 3-4 months. Barely playable on higher speeds.

Having taken a much smaller city (15K people) to 1936, while still having 30-40 FPS on 2x speed, it seems that population increases and number of districts severely limits performance in the game.
This is the one that kills it for me, if I'm doing well, the game becomes unplayable very fast. Until the performance issue is solved, I can't recommend this game.

This game should've been released to Early Access, and sit there for a couple months until it is fully baked, then release it.","Fun game ideas, decent execution on some of them, not-so-good on a lot of them. And then there is the performance problem, or the complete lack of performance.

Je m'attendais à un jeu de gestion complexe, mais pas de cette manière...

Au niveau de l'interface politique, c'est très simple : Si on a le cash, n'importe quelle proposition de loi/décret/modification de quartier passe. Sin on n'a pas le cash, ça ne passe pas.

L'inconvénient de ce principe simpliste, c'est que si ça merde, on est coincé car on ne peut rien décider seul. Donc lorsque la catastrophe arrive, c'est cuit.

Et ça arrive on ne sait pas comment ! J'étais à 50k de recettes par mois. Et sans rien faire, je suis passé à 40k, puis 30k, etc. jusqu'à -25k. Et 10 ans sont passés sans pouvoir rien faire. La seule chose possible, c'est d'augmenter les impôts, mais comme ça fait fuir toute la population et l'industrie, ça ne s'améliore pas. Et comme le compte est en négatif, pas moyen d'améliorer un district pour avoir un meilleur rendement, par exemple. J'avais découvert le gaz, l'électricité etc. mais les coûts d'entretien sont tellement cher que c'est impossible à installer.

Il doit y avoir des astuces, mais l'éditeur n'explique pas du tout comment fonctionne son jeu, alors tout repose sur une économie tordue et incontrôlable.

[h1]我们在梦想与进步中长大。[/h1]

1820年，皇帝赐了你一块地，给了你500k的个人起始资金和1000k的城市资金，作为城市的创建者，从下手划分第一块行政区起，你将要开始你的市长生涯。而这个城市的名字，你把它叫做“Kaisershafen”（要是你没改名的话）。

在最开始的阶段，只能建造一个低密度、仅有最基本的基础设施，甚至连分区比例都无法自定义的行政区，开始走向小城崛起的道路。

Kaisershafen的繁荣发展与别处是不同的，他麻雀虽小，但确人才济济——什么热力学、流行病学、炸药、电子游戏等等，都将在这里被发明。不要怀疑，是虽然表面上是发展云，但是研究完成一个之后会让你选择下一个“发明”，想来诺贝尔、开尔文这样的人物都蜗居在这个小城，这样一个小地方何愁不兴旺发达。甚至将来自己发射个卫星，也不是不可以。更难能可贵的是，这里还是人权斗士的运动基地，什么劳动法、女权、环保、动保，在这里都可以看到他们活动的身影，性爱革命、消除歧视这样的运动也是说“发明”就“发明”，端的是“世界何其大，发展靠我家”。虽然Kaisershafen在地球上占据了这么一个举足轻重的位置，但是也不固步自封，世界之大，我市伸出友谊之手，堪堪选出了6个未来入得了法眼的城市：牛津、旧金山、悉尼、圣彼得堡、上海、仙台，虽不是首都，[strike]但也横跨世界五大洲，哦不少了个非洲。[/strike]

但先不急，先把眼下这个小镇子经营好吧。


[h1]钱，钱，钱！[/h1]

城市发展之本，便是资金了，如何让运营城市的成本低于带来的收益，便是发展首要的问题。

每建立一个行政区，都需要额外的成本，而人口的增长和行政区数量的关系尚不明确，所以要慎重创建新的行政区，在有需求的时候再建岂不稳妥得多。发展的步子也不能迈的太大，不能将无法承担的基建一股脑儿的往城区上般，而要走一步看一步，先找个试验田看看带来的收益能不能值回成本，再考虑是否将这个推广。

这本是一个城市发展的应有方式，然而UE内部经济循环的不明确导致就算成本一时没有把握，城市入不敷出眼看走向崩溃，依然可以靠不断提高税率来弥补漏洞，而此时本是用来制衡市长行为的议会，居然也会用脚投票，只要不结余太多的提税提案，通通通过。

也尝试过降低税率来观察是否能通过刺激消费带来收入的提升，但结果是虽然有略微的提升，但是效果远不如直接调节税率来的明显。虽然高税率之下随处可见破产企业，但是城市收入还是稳步提升，人民也过得幸福如意，简直匪夷所思。

压榨人民制定高税率，虽然日子当下过得有些紧，但在研究完一项科技、时代更替下，收入能实现稳定的增长，日进斗金不是梦。正所谓“降税容易提税难”，赶早变着法从市民手中抠钱才是硬道理。


[h1]我最喜欢胁迫他人了[/h1]

既然提到了议会，那就不能不说说这个游戏的议会系统。

由于前几个时代皇帝钦定了玩家来做这个市长，完全不怕被弹劾，也不怕有竞争者的出现，本来用来制约玩家用来改变法案支持率的“政治货币”党派好感度，尤其在不能跌破下限-10的情况下，其本身意义也然无存。在好感度为正的情况下，恳求非常有效，一旦跌到负值，那么胁迫反而变成了最容易的途径。议会便犹如一个玩具，任由玩家揉捏。

就算是后期出现了竞选也无妨，只要城市发展良好，每两个月去稍微胁迫一下每个党派，市长位置还不是手到擒来。每6年一次的选举，也不过就是消耗我“政治货币”的途径而已，和之前已经不同

至于与经济相关联的提案，只要城市日进斗金，财务无忧，不管有什么政治诉求这些党派都会无脑通过。


[h1]我造的我来毁[/h1]

随着城市的发展，城市密度需要由低向高发展，来容纳更高效率的住房、工厂和商店。然而，在此之前已经建立的建筑物无法自动更新，于是中后期拆迁（需要科技解锁）就变成了一项很常见的工程。虽然看着一座座房屋轰然倒塌是一件很爽快的事情，但是一个区域那么多建筑，一个个点过来确实非常的累。在没有框选和快捷键的条件下，一个个选中建筑，移动到右下角摧毁，在到屏幕中间确认选择，然后一片区域重复几十次，是一件很傻B的事情。

虽然拆迁需要付出一定的代价，相应建筑物带来的利润也会随之失去，但是之后新建筑慢慢拔地而起，带来的利益也是明显的，只是太繁琐的操作容易让人失去耐心，所以我都是在区域比例分配那里先全选成住房，确定改变区域后，再全选为工厂，提交改变，用私人资金改后，再手动分配比例，反正改变区域比例不要钱，所以用自己的钱也就不需要提案，区域人员的安置赔偿都不用管，虽然也要动好几下鼠标，比一个个摧毁省力多了。[spoiler]
虽然这样就不能解锁拆迁成就了[/spoiler]


[h1]自由，平等，博爱！[/h1]

关于人权的问题，一直以来都是现实生活中争议颇多的地方，在这个游戏中也是。琳琅满目的提案，有些就算放到当前来看也是尚未实现。比如同工同酬、同性婚姻合法化等等。非常的pc，倒是我喜的部分。


[h1]退化完成[/h1]

最后说说这个游戏其他方面的质量。

游戏汉化不易，但是这个汉化的质量确实有点垃圾。比如前文提到的“发展”和“发明”指的是同一个东西；比如“少数名族”的同性恋问题；再比如将LGBT翻译为“同性恋”；再比如本段标题的“退化完成”，而英文原文是“Downsizing done”。而只在科技完成时出现的原本就不多z中文语音中，我竟然还在其中听到了一条英文语音，不过我倒是忘了记下是哪一段。没玩过游戏就翻译，以及缺少统筹校对，是很多已有汉化的通病，这个游戏汉化该有的也都有。


游戏本身其他的硬伤也不少：

1.流程单一，一个家族就是一个既定的事件，没有重复玩的价值。三张战役地图大同小异，也就是地形稍有区别，反而是三个挑战还有那么点意思。
2.优化烂，游戏进行到后期卡的不行，载入及保存时间长，常常未响应让人以为程序崩溃。玩着玩着程序崩了的情况也有发生过。
3.内部经济逻辑不清前面已经提及，进入下一个时代只不过就换了个接班人，收入却猛的增加，着实让人捉摸不透。
4.成就系统混乱不堪，目前成就各种张冠李戴。
5.画面，嗯感受一下高楼大厦吧（？

说实话，就凭现在的这个游戏真的不值100+，95也不值。但是我觉得这些并不是根本性的问题，我觉得这款游戏还有很大的发展空间，如果制作者能在后续的更新中体现出诚意，将这些问题逐一解决，这款游戏有望成为真正的大作。

但是这款有有一个很大的BUG，就是资金。一是市长的个人薪资和政府财政收入完全不匹配。
二是各个设施的维护费用过高。也就是说，建设设施的费用与该设施获得的效益不成正比。在不建设部分设施时不会对社会产生明显的负面影响，说白了就是没有城市之间的横向对比。游戏模糊了吸引人口入住和人口流失的评判标准。很容易利用这个点打通关。
另外，我有一个建议，可以加入吸引高端人才的一些提案。
总之，这个游戏整合度很高，但是相互之间的关联不是很大。但不否认是一个好游戏。",

-混乱的建筑图标
-无法变更区域内各地块位置

Много механик, которые не объясняются, много событий не имеют пояснений. Кроме того, экономика ведёт себя очень странно. Не понятно как нужно себя вести чтобы иметь нормальны стабильный доход, а город имел хоть какую-то инфраструктуру.
На протяжении первых двух эр всё что нужно делать пользователю это перематывать время и время от времени проталкивать полезные законопроекты через совет города. Назвать это интересным можно с большим трудом. Интриги весьма примитивны, идеологии партий играют несущественную роль (если вообще играют). Толком взаимодействовать с партиями вообще нельзя! Можно лишь слегка влиять на их голосование по конкретному вопросу.

- This game is UNIQUE: politics is the center of this construction game. I've never seen it before. So people complaning about the lack of construction in this game: yeah, you knew it! It was said a lot by the developers. I like politics and this game shows something interesting!
- Long-life game: this game will provide hours of gaming. Each game will be totally different by your actions, your family and what happens. Maybe not totally at the beginning because some reforms are useful for your city ... But when Era II comes, it changes everything.
- Difficulty is gowing slowly more and more difficult ... Era III was a pain in the ass.
- You'll need skills to get your reforms done after Era III because you'll get more parties (up to 6-7) with different opinions, different support of the population (their vote depends about the time but also what your city provides ! More you get schools, the less extremists have chances to get votes).
- You get A LOT OF different events that can TOTALLY have an impact on the city: accepting a Lama from a contry, entering in a group of extremists to help your city become independant, chosing a wife etc... A real diversity which makes every game unique.

+/- Why not but ... +/-
- Didacticial: not so useful. Not mandatory also.
- Scenarios: according to me, I did not find fun about it. It can be appreciated for some of you.

- NO NO NO ! -
- Only 4 families? Seriously? And you ALWAYS begin with the same character ... I would like to get more families and in each family, have a choice of at least 3 different people (because they give bonuses and malus to your city). Seriously, please! -> Be aware that ALL families are unlocked at the beginning of the game so you don't have to play hours to choose.
- Public services: really really expensive. And sometimes I don't get bonuses from them. You say Gas help factories, but I've never seen mine getting more money. You'll get hard times guy to get perfect city quickly by upgrading it! You'll need to wait a long time before getting enough money to invest ... Unless politics accept your idea to raise taxes +10% in a year (they can accept +1/2% sometimes).

这个游戏总体来说还是挺好玩，对初心者而言不算友好
但是整体上耐玩度还是挺高的，主要体现在社会运作的规划、决策上
在这个游戏社会里面一直存在左右翼，要保持他们的平衡，我的打法是不参与其中任何一方
在税收上，初期可以高税，有了老本之后，就要‘划区而治’，同时税收可以根据实际情况调低。
简单点说：
高税收，可以带来很多眼前利益，有钱了可以让很多法案的高通过率。但是不利于城市人口、工业进一步发展。同时右翼往往感到反感
低税收，鼓励扶持工厂建设、商店开铺、人口移民。但是荷包不一定能撑得住，同时左翼比较反感低工业税。低税收的坏处是眼前利益很少，甚至赤字。但是一旦成型了，加起速来很快的。

Tropico was almost the same replacing certain buildings with the idea of zoning that are prevalent in the other games. What I truly wanted in a game as complex as Cities: Skyline was a council that lorded and hounded at every decision I made through the giant political machine hovering over my fair city.

Urban Empire was supposed to bridge that gap between city builder and political simulator. Marketed as “Be a Mayor Player”, whatever that meant, you had to develop the city through different eras and leaders through both physical development and the political challenges. You had to develop the city’s society through services while balancing the budget with the city council’s eye on your every move.

Oh, what fun I will have!

Or, was it a disappointment?

Barring you the description of how the “Wheel of Life” (supply/demand for societal expansion) works, let me tell what worked and didn’t.

I love the idea of a city council. Frankly, the only reason for me to get this game is because of the idea of city development through voting in a city council. The simulated cityfolk are still allowed to partake in the city’s market economy, but certain services in the Wheel of Life requires the city council’s intervention. Services like fire stations, parks, clinics, opera houses, schools and workshops require that the council vote over the improvement.

I also love that the city council has era-appropriate parties occupying the council. My personal favorites were the existence of three parties: The Freedom Party (aka the Nazi Party), The Pacifist Party (super left-wing and liberal), and the Green Party (same like Pacifist Party, but more environmental). Political maneuvering with various parties with different ideologies isn’t a walk in the park. Liberal policies will be unacceptable to some parties, but with the correct development and policies placed into the city early in the game, you can have conservative parties agreeing with leftists liberal policies. The game’s city council rewards players who know how to political maneuver themselves through the era with the easement of passing legislation.

However, even with such “coded rewards” written into the game, it suffers from a very counterintuitive user interface. My anecdote is with the idea of banning prostitution and the failed revocation of that law. While the game works on a dual axis binary of conservative/liberal and left/right which works to describe a political ideology, binary shouldn’t be used for your mayor’s decision on certain laws. Like real life, a law passes or fails through the vote of the city council. 
However, your mayor can only push for a law ahead. If you were to personally revoke a law and convince political parties, they will not push for the revocation. What needs to be worked on are the clarification for the poltical choices of Pleading, Demanding, or Threaten a political party. The developers need to add an additional button to show whether a mayor is pushing to support or oppose if the player makes a mistake.

Speaking of mistakes, the performance of this game slows after building a lot of districts. As my trams in some districts zigzag their way through town, the scrolling speed to and fro the city is hampered as building textures load slowly or having serious graphical glitches. The performance has been problem since Tropico 4. Kalypso and the development team at Reborn Games need to calibrate and fix these issues if they were to create sequels. I understand the simulation games are the ones to usually suffer performance issues (like Cities XL), but albeit the game being playable, it becomes an absolute dread as the game stutters dealing with new simulations to compute. Mind you, I was also running my Performance Monitor next to my game and it is a RAM-eater, taking up 7 GBs of memory to run this game, even after adjusting graphic qualities to its lowest.

In conclusion, the only reason I am recommending this game is due to its uniqueness of it being both a city-builder and a political simulator. However, I would love the developers to start thinking of this game like a Paradox Interactive game, giving us greater freedom in creating a character and the political situation around the player. I would like them to solve the major performance issues that made this game somewhat unplayable in future eras of the game. Personally, I would return to this game again once they have patched some of the performance and UI issues.","I love city builders.

[b]It's fun, half-way in...[/b] The tutorial is bullshit, and the RCI demand is a lie; Keep building districts and make sure you keep an eye on taxation, I cannot stress this enough. Like the developers have hinted, this game is [b]NOT a city-builder[/b] but rather, a city-ruler type of game, a new type of sub-genre for strategy games and I think this is a great idea, this game also adds an interactive and engaging storyline for each one of the houses, if the engine decides to give you those events...
------------------------------------ More in Depth ↓ -----------------------------------

[b]Politics:[/b] the Politics in this game are utter garbage, a left-wing ""CONSERVATIVE"" party like the communists will support increase taxation for lower-class members and less taxation for upper classes. FDP are just a nuscane at the beginning and there is no way you can play this game in a ""Conservative way"" as the game FORCES you to progress. 

I think the political system is just shallow and lame, needs much more design.. for example the political compass should be Authoritarian - Libertarian (socio-economic compass) instead of Conservative-Liberals. I would also suggest to the Developers to add a ""trait"" system to parties, which will hinder their like to vote for-or-against different legislation so we don't have commies voting for INCREASING CHURCH FUNDING. Anyways, yes, the politics of this game are engaging but this feels more like ""Barriers"", these parties have no life to them.

[b]Novel/story:[/b] The story is interesting, and as I said earlier, if you're lucky enough to get the game to give you them.. Sometimes it doesn't, and you start out with a really shitty ruler or you don't know anything about the ruler except what the game gives you every era... Happened to me in Era IV/V. The von Pfilzens are interesting, and so are the Kilgannons, probably my favorite families to play in this game.

[b]City-building aspect:[/b] now I know this is NOT a city-builder but a city-ruler but it does have the city-building element to it, and frankly, its shallow and lame... Its not engaging as I thought it was, you don't have much say in how different grids and spreads are choosen aside from the ""Change the spread"" of a district thing. Going through Eras it becomes a general burden to upgrade your districts, the game offers no ""total district"" change stuff, so you have to keep changing infrastructure and roads manually which usually ends up being rejected-or-accepted depending on the parties in control. I wish the devs would put more focus on this aspect and the politics as they did on the story.

[b]Invention (AKA RESEARCH):[/b] The research part is smart, its cool and its engaging, I love it. There's not much to say, I think this is where the game excells in. Different research/inventeions give you different edicts, upgrades and unlocks new stuff (But by Era IV theres nothing new to unlock really except for upgrades).

[b]Engine & Sound:[/b] Sound is great, music is great. Engine, I heard people have had crashes, and that sucks.. I have only experienced one when transferring over to Era V, that's when it moved me back to Era 2 for some reason and It crashed... The game in graphics really lacks, I have a GTX 1070 that can run ARK and other games in probably the highest-res and so on (on 1080p and probably 4k) but somehow this game makes sure that my FPS is below 30 and constantly lags, drops or some other weird shit... Like damn, fix your stuff Rebel.


[b][i]In short[/i][/b] this game had potential, still has... I am not sure what went wrong with the devs, but I have to unfortunately give this game a 50% rating, and this is coming from someone who has 11+ hours in the game and got almost all the victory achievements. I would NOT recommend this game at its current stage, and I fear for the worse; that Kalypso and Rebel Media plan on adding and fixing a lot of these issues in over-priced DLC's...  (Current rating is not recommended, will change if patched and changed over time).

My message to the developers; Please, do not make this a DLC-expanded game, fix your issues and patch the game up before any DLC's!

Anyways, this is my take on the game... Feel free to add me on Steam if you'd like to hear more about my pro's and con's in regards to this game, or if you'd like me to help you out with strategy and development of your cities (If you bought the game).","As someone who has played 11 hours on this game, had three different campaigns and basically got all the ways to win, and get a victory I must say this game still has must work to do.

[b]It's fun, half-way in...[/b] The tutorial is bullshit, and the RCI demand is a lie; Keep building districts and make sure you keep an eye on taxation, I cannot stress this enough. Like the developers have hinted, this game is [b]NOT a city-builder[/b] but rather, a city-ruler type of game, a new type of sub-genre for strategy games and I think this is a great idea, this game also adds an interactive and engaging storyline for each one of the houses, if the engine decides to give you those events...
------------------------------------ More in Depth ↓ -----------------------------------

[b]Politics:[/b] the Politics in this game are utter garbage, a left-wing ""CONSERVATIVE"" party like the communists will support increase taxation for lower-class members and less taxation for upper classes. FDP are just a nuscane at the beginning and there is no way you can play this game in a ""Conservative way"" as the game FORCES you to progress. 

I think the political system is just shallow and lame, needs much more design.. for example the political compass should be Authoritarian - Libertarian (socio-economic compass) instead of Conservative-Liberals. I would also suggest to the Developers to add a ""trait"" system to parties, which will hinder their like to vote for-or-against different legislation so we don't have commies voting for INCREASING CHURCH FUNDING. Anyways, yes, the politics of this game are engaging but this feels more like ""Barriers"", these parties have no life to them.

[b]Novel/story:[/b] The story is interesting, and as I said earlier, if you're lucky enough to get the game to give you them.. Sometimes it doesn't, and you start out with a really shitty ruler or you don't know anything about the ruler except what the game gives you every era... Happened to me in Era IV/V. The von Pfilzens are interesting, and so are the Kilgannons, probably my favorite families to play in this game.

[b]City-building aspect:[/b] now I know this is NOT a city-builder but a city-ruler but it does have the city-building element to it, and frankly, its shallow and lame... Its not engaging as I thought it was, you don't have much say in how different grids and spreads are choosen aside from the ""Change the spread"" of a district thing. Going through Eras it becomes a general burden to upgrade your districts, the game offers no ""total district"" change stuff, so you have to keep changing infrastructure and roads manually which usually ends up being rejected-or-accepted depending on the parties in control. I wish the devs would put more focus on this aspect and the politics as they did on the story.

[b]Invention (AKA RESEARCH):[/b] The research part is smart, its cool and its engaging, I love it. There's not much to say, I think this is where the game excells in. Different research/inventeions give you different edicts, upgrades and unlocks new stuff (But by Era IV theres nothing new to unlock really except for upgrades).

[b]Engine & Sound:[/b] Sound is great, music is great. Engine, I heard people have had crashes, and that sucks.. I have only experienced one when transferring over to Era V, that's when it moved me back to Era 2 for some reason and It crashed... The game in graphics really lacks, I have a GTX 1070 that can run ARK and other games in probably the highest-res and so on (on 1080p and probably 4k) but somehow this game makes sure that my FPS is below 30 and constantly lags, drops or some other weird shit... Like damn, fix your stuff Rebel.


[b][i]In short[/i][/b] this game had potential, still has... I am not sure what went wrong with the devs, but I have to unfortunately give this game a 50% rating, and this is coming from someone who has 11+ hours in the game and got almost all the victory achievements. I would NOT recommend this game at its current stage, and I fear for the worse; that Kalypso and Rebel Media plan on adding and fixing a lot of these issues in over-priced DLC's...  (Current rating is not recommended, will change if patched and changed over time).

My message to the developers; Please, do not make this a DLC-expanded game, fix your issues and patch the game up before any DLC's!

Anyways, this is my take on the game... Feel free to add me on Steam if you'd like to hear more about my pro's and con's in regards to this game, or if you'd like me to help you out with strategy and development of your cities (If you bought the game)."

29414239,schinese,2017.00.22 09:21,✅,✅,0.7429937124,38,"玩了2个晚上，是时候写个评测了。
关于这个游戏，当初是很期待的，感觉戳中我的G点，看介绍很适合我。
但是因为是小作坊做的，不敢相信品质，20号那天才预购的，玩了2个晚上了，说一些意见和建议。
这个游戏的优点
1.行政区。
老实说，这个我觉得的确是优点，为什么呢，因为我他妈的不会规划交通啊！每次玩天际线和模拟城市，看着交通网都纠结好久，不会规划，老是堵车，这个游戏直接用行政区来帮玩家规划，对我而言，反而是一个优点。
2.议会系统。
老实说，当初我看宣传的时候，突出的都是议会系统，我以为是《威尼斯崛起》那种傻吊十人帮。然后玩了游戏，发现不一样，挺有意思的，各种撕逼也很有趣。
3.事件，法令，科技树
法令很丰富，比以前玩过的模拟经营游戏多了很多选项，然后科技树也有文明的那种感觉。
这个游戏的缺点还有意见以及建议
1.优化。
恕我直言，这游戏的优化跟屎一样，感觉完全没优化就放上来了。我的配置是I5-6500+蓝宝石RX480超白金8G+16G内存，这配置玩，刚开始还行，然后行政区一多，就开始卡，各种卡顿，帧数只有15帧，玩的好痛苦。
建议：开发商肯定玩过文明吧，文明有个战略地图模式，就是一张平面上显示各种建筑资源地形之类的，你们可以参考那个，然后优化也要做好。
2.议会。
这游戏主打的就是议会系统，刚开始的时候挺有意思的，感觉很有趣，但是后期发现，只要不是明着怼，法案很容易通过的，政党感觉就是摆设。然后希望可以增加一个专门的政党界面啊，用来显示政党资料和对这个政党的手段，比如举办宴会邀请，或者贿赂党首之类的，而不是只能靠时间慢慢回复政党好感度。对了，刚开始玩家是钦定的，但是后面得选举，我觉得最好可以让玩家可以加入一个政党，然后推行倾向这个政党的政策和法令，诱导人民投票给这个政党，然后你在议会就无往不利了，这样玩家也比较有代入感，而不是觉得这些政党都是投票的傻吊。
3.事件。
很多事件挺符合时代的，但是有些事件感觉很超前，我记得18XX年，第一世代的时候，有个政党事件，玩家可以选择打电话给那个政党的党首沟通，那个时代已经有电话了吗？第一世代我记得是1860年以前吧。然后19世纪就有各种什么女性权益法，环保法，动物保护法，这也太超前了吧。
意见：我觉得这个开发组应该有玩过P社的游戏吧，维多利亚有个觉醒度，我觉得你们可以参考下，比如女性的觉醒度高了，就会要求女权之类的，这个觉醒度可以通过学校，或者事件，或者时间增加之类的，而不是单单的一个傻吊议员说“我们来讨论讨论关于女权的议题吧”，然后一群议会老爷就开会讨论了。
然后的话，事件有些选项，可以看到选择之后的后果，比如什么特质加多少，什么特质减多少，或者金钱消耗多少，但是有些选项缺没有，我的希望是所有的选项都可以看到选择之后的后果，这样可以让玩家更明确的知道自己要选择什么，而不是靠猜测。
3.人物特质
这个人物特质的加成，有些挺有用，有些完全体现不出来效果，然后的话，关于增加特质的事件太少了，玩到下一个时代，换了后代上台都不一定增加特质。
意见：增加获得特质的事件，或者让玩家可以自己研发，我又要拿P社游戏举例了，CK2，你们多多参考下嘛。很多特质感觉没有存在感，然后想要获得新特质，也不知道怎么获得。培育后代也是这样，想培养个好后代来接班，但是完全没有选项和事件可以触发。
4.财报以及界面。
这个我要单独拿出来说说，这个游戏的财报是我见过最最最最最垃圾最最最简陋的模拟经营游戏财报。他妈的，你们好意思自称模拟经营游戏，财报就一个支出，一个收入，还有一个余额。你们能再简陋点吗？一个好的，详细的，直观的财报，是一个模拟经营游戏的标准啊。
意见：改，他妈的，我通过了卖电给国家的法令，然后想要看看我卖电获得了多少钱，完全看不到，然后想要针对性的看看支出哪里出问题，哪里需要改进，也看不到。不要跟我说议会里面的那个税率，我要的是财报。
然后界面的话，希望可以增加一个界面，专门用来显示所有的BUFF和DEBUFF，我又又要拿P社游戏举例了，欧陆风云4，国家界面有个专门的界面用来显示国家获得的所有BUFF和DEBUFF。
整体界面的话，感觉还行，但是还是可以进步，比如右下角，那里是空的，可以考虑把日志的触发事件放到那里之类的，你们开发组自己看着改，反正这个整体界面不是很好。
哦，对了，还得有个界面，用来看报纸和触发的事件，维多利亚2 的时候，看报纸就真的有改变世界的感觉，你们的报纸还不是很丰富，就3个版。还是经常重复的新闻，多加点东西啊，比如议会老爷在会上大打出手，又比如通过了一项法令，然后有市民从中受益或者受到伤害之类的。
5.自定义模式
自定义模式，或者沙盒模式，或者无限模式，这个是每个模拟经营游戏必备的吧，这游戏就只有战役和场景，很无趣的，然后的话时间是个大问题，老是从1820年开始很枯燥的，前期没啥事情可以做。希望自定义模式可以自由的选择世代，我想从现代开始。
写了这么多，这游戏我还是挺看好的，虽然现在感觉像个半成品。希望你们多多努力，给你们个好评吧",
29414179,english,2017.00.22 09:17,✅,✅,0.5,0,Really loved the depth in this game ; lots of choice and a lot of political realism ; what I would love to see for an expansion would be more scenarios such as the WWI period and the revolutions that followed.  Maybe stuff in response to the Great Depression and World War Two.  Also I take it the early game is based on the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  Historically the Austrian Social Democrats were Marxists until they were crushed by fascism.  BTW I'm only up to the 1920s so far - so I don't know what comes after.  Sometimes I think I'd rather a scenario based on leading a Party rather than a single Mayor ; But who am I to complain?  This game fixes lots of the problems I once associated with the Genre.  A progressive welfare state is viable without ideological assumptions in the scripting which rule out social democratic strategies.  I really hope expansions and mods follow this ; Its really good so far - but I'm sure it could be better.  One last thing that annoyed me:  I hung on as Mayor in the 1920s but I can't seem to shake the right-wing parties ; I'm still getting good legislation through ; But it would be nice to have strategies capable of turning the tide in favor of the left-wing parties...  BTW the Communists also often play a spoiling role early on - which is not historical...

I would like to be able to have more insight on the politics.  Why do we have to vote on everything?  What do the people want more in order to grow?  The demand bars also aren't doing it.

中文语音还是蛮惊喜的，类似文明6的感觉，但有点少，就科技研究完成来一段。
由于中国的政治原因，大陆的左右派理念是跟西方几乎相反的，这点理解起来比较变扭。

Tutorial is sketchy and superficial , and doesnt explain all the game mechanics to run the city properly. 

The political side of things is ridiculous. Everything runs on goodwill and prestige , which the tutorial conveniently left out on how to obtain it.

The city building side fared better , click to add options to district and buildings.  However ,  what the tutorial neglected to teach was how to generate more money for the city which usually leaves players struggling to build a city they like.  In this aspect , sims like Tropico feels easier to understand. 

Another thing i hated was how boring it became as the the game went on. Things got repetitive fairly quickly. Research new tech , wait forever just to have the money to implement 1 of the perks of the new tech in a part of your city , fight the various political factions to pass through the agreement to build that single building or implement that new tech , which is fairly ridiculous to me. 

This game doesn't feel like it has a end game objective. Sure, there are victory conditions listed in the logbook , be it for campaign mode or scenario mode , but the campaign mode's background story is just that , a background distraction. There is no story or plot whatsoever to immerse in . 

I wouldn't recommend this game at all , unless you have hours to burn and you have really absolutely nothing else to play.","This game doesn't feel complete at all.

I immediately pre-ordered it and raved about it to my classmates, who then regretted forgetting to pre-order. Then, I was struck by the sub-20 FPS optimization on the lowest settings with anti-aliasing turned off, the 20-minute loading time, and the incomplete translation at the start.

Je ne suis pas déçu. Vous devez gérer une ville, quartier par quartier. Et quand je dis gérer, c'est passer par le Conseil Communal pour prendre les décisions. 

C'est peut-être là que le jeu est répétif: pour chaque décision de construction, d'amélioration, il faut passer par le vote des partis du Conseil municipal. Sauf si vous avez assez d'argent dans votre compte personnel. 

Pour ma première partie, j'ai ""tenu"" environ 100 ans avant de voir les partis voter contre ma réélection en tant que maire de la ville. Commencée en 1821, ma partie s'est terminée au début de 1939...

Les points positifs: 
 - graphismes agréables 
 - langue française intégrale 
 - les détails du gameplay changent selon les années (par exemple, pas de voitures en ville avant d'avoir découvert le moteur).
 - Le système du jeu politique

Les points négatifs:
 - Actions répétitives
 - Comme dans tous les jeux de gestion: le manque d'argent continuel (qui oblige presque à tricher...)
 - l'impossibilité de modifier certaines options de toute la ville d'un coup (le revêtement des routes, le métro, les égouts, etc). Il faut le faire quartier par quartier...

Cons
- The praised 1000 events are boring with very minor (if at all impact). It's just a popup, you choose an option and get a mostly useless bonus or harmless malus. I had hoped for some event chains, something requiring action and something refreshing now and then. Nothing. 
- Economy often makes no sense whatsoever. The income drops and increases A LOT rather randomly and you don't even get a hint of why. The statistic tab is abismal. Most stuff you can't really read out of it.
- The family choice is bland and rather meaningless. I usually approve roleplay elements like this but this is VERY basic and not fun.
- I really hoped for more of an impact of the world's events on the town. There is (close to) nothing there. That makes absolutely no sense.
- There really isn't much point in optimisation. At times the most profitable districts are the basic ones without any costly upgrades.
- Based on my observations there seems to be only one real way to be financially successful (not spoiling it). All attempts to use other playstyles that based on the data given (demands for residents, commercy, industry) would have made way more sense ended horribly bad.
- I see close to no replay value. The events don't offer any. 

Pros:
- The approach for science is nice and refreshing.
- Living through the changes in history e.g. the rights of women, the privileges initially reserved to few yet opened up over time is quite fun.

Сложность для въезжания ) и как закономерность быстрое банкротство. Ну и конечно в каждой эпохе мы двигаем содомию в массы, это конечно жесть.

29409187,german,2017.00.22 02:49,✅,✅,0.5933333039,10,"Ich finde dieses Spiel gut, weil erschreckend realistisch (also in den Grundzügen). 

Was gerne von einigen der Bewerter hier übersehen wird, ist die Tatsache, das man hier nicht zwangsläufig eine Stadt aufbaut wie bei Tropico, Anno xyz etc. also hier ein Weizenfeld, da eine Mühle und dort den Bäcker und alle kullern satt und glücklich den Berg hinab, sondern als Stadtoberhaupt einen Stadtteil nach dem nächsten aus dem Boden stampfen soll, immer mit der Opposition im Hintergrund, die eigentlich immer alles besser weiß. 
Soll heißen, man kann durchaus ein Grundstück als  Wohnviertel, Gewerbepark und ein Industriegebiet zuweisen, aber hat im Prinzip nicht den geringsten Einfluss darauf, was genau das Gewerbe und die Industrie ist (im Gegensatz zu oben genannten  - Volk hungert->her mit dem Gemüsefeld). Bauen kann man nur städtische Gebäude wie Schule und Polizei sowie Infrastruktur wie Gas, Wasser, Sch... - wenn es denn die Partein zulassen.

Was die Partein anbelangt - wie auch im wahren Leben, nur an sich denkend, wie die Macht und das Wohlwollen des Volkes zu Ihren Gunsten gesteigert werden kann. So wird der Antrag der Steuererhöhung abgelehnt, nur um einige Monate später selbst vorgebracht zu werden. Hier liegt auch der einzige Kritikpunkt - weil vorhersehbar - den ich bisher finden konnte - wenn das Geld stimmt, dann wird im Prinzip jeder Antrag angenommen, wenn nicht, dann gibt es eben keinen Strom, der der Industrie zwar Aufschwung und der Stadt mehr Einnahmen bescheren würde, aber es will eben keiner im Stadtrat sitzen, wenn Schulden gemacht werden.

Grundlegende Fehler konnte auch ich nicht finden. Richtig ist, dass es augenscheinlich an manchen Stellen einen Automatismus gibt, der in meinen Augen aber nicht als Bug gesehen werden kann. Wenn der Bahnhof freigeschaltet ist, dann wollen normalerweise alle das Bauwerk - ausser natürlich meine Partein - und dann schaut sich der Bürgermeister nunmal die Baustelle an.

Somit würde ich jedem, der nur ein Stadtaufbauspiel sucht, von diesem hier abraten, da gibt es mehr als genug, die mit Sicherheit dieses Bedürfnis vollkommen befriedigen. Jenen jedoch, die eine Herausforderung suchen, sind hier genau richtig. Selbst wenn mal keine Entscheidung im Raum steht, verändert sich die Situation ständig. Hier sterben die Einwohner, da schließt das Geschäft und dort geht die Möbelfabrik bankrott und schon hat man negative Einnahmen, die man im Moment nicht wirklich beeinflussen kann. In meinen Augen ein wirklich interessantes Spiel, bei dem ich teilweise wirklich froh bin, wenn ich mal nichts tun muss und alles läuft.",

Эта игра меня зацепила своей идеей, что вы будете в роли мэра города и будите не только строить здания как в градостроительном симуляторе, но и еще и решать вопросы и проблемы города. В этой игре это есть, но не до конца реализована. Теперь посмотрим более детально механику и визуальную части игры:

- [b] Графика [/b] тут яркая, но мыльная. Модельки все плохо прорисованы, хоть у меня и стояла графика на высоком уровне в настройках. Что мне понравилось, так это модельки зданий, хоть и не совсем детально, но зато красиво детализированы.

- [b] Про оптимизацию [/b] ничего сказать не могу. Некоторые пишут, что игра не оптимизирована, а у кого-то оптимизирована. Думаю, это уже зависит не от игры, а от компьютера, так как у меня все идет идельно.

- Хочу так же отметить, что улицы вашего города будут практически пустые, так как на экране, когда вы приближаете до максимально близкого расстояния, будут появляться максимум 5-10 горожан и 3-8 карет. Модельки так же плохо детализированны, анимация передвижения топорная, да и к тому же они имею свойство проходить скозь друг друга.

- [b] Функции [/b] у игры мало, так что через некоторое время игры вам начинет надоедать делать одно и то же. К примеру, в игре есть такие функции, как указы, налоги, финансирование, постройка района (выбор территории для затройки зданий типа: промышленность, коммерция, жилье) и постройка особых зданий (Театр, полиция и т.д.). И за это все надо еще чтобы проголосовали городские партии, которых еще и можно умолять, требовать и угрожать, для того, чтобы они проголосовали за ваши предложения. Но и тут встречаются одиннаковые реплики. И доходит все до того, что это все повторяется круг за кругом и нет разнообразия.

- Также что меня больше всего возмутило, в данном случае на русском интерфейсе игры, текст, а то есть описание тех или иных функции, очень маленький, что очень неудобно.

Игра только появилась, и ее создавала только вышедшая на свет кампания игроделов, от чего и хочу сказать, что игра вышла на первое время достойно, но ее необходимо доработать, иначе про нее забудут через некоторое время. Например, добавить новые функии в управлении городом. Сама идея мне очень понравилась и, надеюсь, что игру не будут забрасывать и будут работать над ней. Думаю, пока не стоить покупать игру, и подождать дальнейшего развития или купить, чтобы поддержать разработчиков. А лучше посмотреть видео на ютубе.",

Game look like been rushed out many many bug that made the game unstable and not really good to play( buit thanks for the idea how to fix it)
lots of areas have so much potential but have not been really finished punlic transport self deciding where it goes.
plan tool to creat new districts are sluggy and make it sometime really to hard to creat a nice dirstric soecial the roads are not well place on any optin

price for that game is typicly kalipso style and by fare over the top and need at least reduce to 25 gbp 

result 

This game schould be go back in open beta because for me it looks like a godd open beta what need a lot of patching up.
there is high potential in this game and if the game maker stay behind there game than I think this game can be a good game 

I recomand this game for the steam 2 hour trail where you can get refound if you decidet this is not a game for you.","I wasnt really sure about this game after I washed a lot of videos on you tube.

Pro

New type of city building special the council part.
Lots of diferent type of events what give you the chance to play that game again and it could have a iferent outcome

ich hatte das Spiel schon lange Zeit vorbestellt und mich schon sehr darauf gefreut mal wieder eine wirklich gute und spannende Simulation zu spielen.

Ich habe das Spiel nach 2h Spielzeit zurückgegeben daher bitte auch gerne Bewertungen mit einer höheren Spielzeit eher beachten als meine! Ich kann hier nur aufzählen was mir wirklich extrem gefehlt hat um mich in dem Spiel von Anfang an zurechtzufinden und wohl zu fühlen:

Was mir gleich am Anfang aufgefallen ist war die Ähnlichkeit der Bauweise von Bezirken und den Bedürfnissen zu bekannten Spielen wie Simcity oder auch Citys Skylines, die ich beide sehr lange und gerne gespielt habe. Eigentlich war das für mich auch ein Grund warum ich das Spiel eigentlich hätte gut annehmen sollen.

Aber genau hier ist der Haken an der Sache. Anders als bei genannten Spielen fehlt Urban Empire einfach alles was man braucht um erfolgreich eine Stadt zu leiten. Es gibt zwar eine Hand voll Bildschirme an denen man Bedürfnisse von Bürgern, Parteien etc einsehen kann aber insgesamt ist das Spiel fast schon furchterregend überschaubar.

Ich habe zu beginn versucht das erste Scenario ( bei dem man Waffe, Schießpulver etc  für den Kaiser bauen soll ) zu spielen und bin gleich mehrfach an verschiedenen Faktoren gescheitert.

Die Industrie z.b. ist von mir in folgenderweise beeinflussbar gewesen.
1. Bau neuer Bezirke = der Bau neuer Bezirke muss von Senat verabschiedet werden, was soweit noch nicht das großte Problem war. Also beantragte ich einen Bezirk der 136k Baukosten haben sollte und 0k monatliche Kosten.....soweit so gut. Antrag wird bewilligt und der Bezirk gebaut ( ohen zusätzliche Dinge wie Hospital Schule oder mehr Infrastruktur als nur einfache Straßen wohlgemerkt ). Mein monatliches Budget ging von +8k in nur 2 Monaten nach dem Bau des Bezirks auf -136k.......Also suchte ich in Statistikem nach dem Grund konnte aber nicht so wirklich einen finden.

2. ständig aufploppende Fenster mit 3-4 möglichen Antworten wie ich mit verschiedenen Dinge wie explosionen in Fabriken, ausgelaugten Arbeitern oder Schwarzmarktgeschäften umgehen will. Ich empfand diese andauernden Es passiert Dies mache Das Situationen eher nervend, da ich nicht wirklich den Eindruck hatte das ich hier wirklich Politik mache...zumahl die Antworten sogar immer den gleichen Einfluss hatten wenn ich gesichert und geladen habe.

Ich hatte zu keiner Zeit wirklich das Gefühl viel Einfluss auf das ganze Geschehen oder auch die Parteien zu haben. Zu den Parteien an sich ahben andere ja schon genug gesagt.

Vom Aufbau her ist das Spiel ebenfalls alles andere als schön. Die Grafik ist statisch und wirklich mangelhaft, außerdem undetailiert und man hat das Gefühl immer nur zwischen 2 Bildschirmen hin un herzuhüpfen weil man zwischen 2 Abstimmungen eh so gut wie nichts zu tun hat. Naja mag sein das sich das später ändert aber ich habe mich noch nie so gelangweilt bei einem Game.

Mein Fazitzusammengefasst:

- schwache Grafik
- Keine Atmosphäre
- zu wenig ausgebaute Einflussmöglichkeiten
- zu wenig erkennbare Informationen die einem helfen richtig zu entscheiden
- so gut wie keine Einflussnahme auf die Wirtschaft
- schlecht erkennbarer Zusammenhang zwischen zukünftigen Einnahmen und ausgaben

insgesamt Nette Idee ab er ""bisher"" schlecht umgesetzt

Für die Leute die sich vielleicht weniger erwartet haben als ich ( oder gar nichts bestimmtes erwarten ) lohnt sich vielleicht das warten auf Bugfixes, Verbesserungen oder auch Preisminderungen im Sale

The scenario I used for my first family is pretty much about a small city in the heart of Europe. I didn't fully grasp the first two eras, and the finances were in tatters. I could only write letters to the emperor to mitigate the damage, then cut the budget, raise taxes, and pass a few economic-boosting bills to slowly recover (though it was pretty cool to have the money back after that). By the third generation, things were utterly disastrous, with year after year of deficits, and it wasn't until the fourth generation that they finally recovered (though the plot here is quite realistic; it was the Great Depression of 1933, and everyone knows the consequences). The Senate also gave me a taste of the ""character"" of that era. Basically, you couldn't pass a single policy without following the Party's policies. Then, in the fourth generation, to fill the gap, they simply cut the tax rate in half. Huh? Not convinced? Just dig up your past bad history 2333, and you'll pass. If you don't have a bad history, just threaten and yell a few times, and that's pretty good too 23333. Then you'll get good at it later. Just wait until 2020 to finish it, and then go to sleep.
(Speaking of which, by the time the fifth generation rolls around, the newspapers will have some gaming news, like The Sims is out, Respawn has a new game, and Respawn's games are the best, etc. 2333. Is that really okay to brag about yourself? Hhhhhhhhh)"

Unfortunately, the twist, i.e. the city politics, is one-dimensional and totally lacking in interaction with the other factions. Your family choice seems to have no bearing on the gameplay, other than the odd event which pops up every couple of years, and the lack of customisation is a shocking misstep (perhaps when basing a game around family dynasties, Kalypso could have looked at the success seen by Paradox with their Crusader Kings II series).

É um jogo com foco em política, o que não é um gênero popular se não com um publico bem específico (eu por exêmplo).

Existem duas formas de explicar esse jogo:
 -A 1ª é bem simples, mas depende de que você conhecer ou não outros jogos do gênero. Como DEMOCRACY, se conhecer esse jogo, imagine DEMOCRACY, com uma arvore de tecnologia como CIVILIZATION, porém ao em vez do design minimalista de DEMOCRACY você tem uma estrutura gráfica como em PATRICIAN. Então é como jogar DEMOCRACY no universo de PATRICIAN. 

-A 2ª forma é para as pessoas que não são acostumadas com Tycoons ou jogos políticos. O jogo NÃO É um City Builder, pelo menos, não exatamente. Isso foi deixado claro pelos desenvolvedores em diversos devy diaries ao longo do desenvolvimento do jogo (caso não tenha acompanhado). 
*Você é um politico, e faz parte de um conselho politico, você não simplesmente constrói um hospital, você propõe que um hospital seja construído onde você o posicionou; Essa proposta entrará em votação em alguns meses durante esse período haverão reuniões onde você pode tentar convencer que a construção do hospital é uma coisa boa, caso algum partido de direita ou esquerda não concorde com você. 
*Você não constrói casas ou industrias, você cria distritos e separa a zona de construção (como em SimCity [residencial, comercial, industrial]) e claro, este distrito precisará ser aprovado para ser construído.
*As construções para a votação vão depender da economia, necessidade, despesas que vão gerar, impacto no distrito, etc... Você não vai construir SÓ porque você quer, existe a possibilidade de construir a vulso, mas isso vai custar seu dinheiro pessoal, e se prepare para possíveis represarias de partidos ou impactos negativos na economia por alguma má decisão que vai fazer você pensar ""é realmente não era pra ser construído""

Para mim as únicas coisas que me ""incomodam"" nesse jogo são:
-Não existe muita atuação vocal; isso poderia ser melhor explorado no jogo, poderia ter mais falas e mais efeitos sonoros vocais, em contra partida TODOS os jogos políticos geralmente são 100% leitura, o que faz o jogo ser bem mais fechado para o público, o problema é que quando você se depara com os gráficos que o jogo tem, no fundo-no fundo faz você achar que algo está incompleto. 
-O sistema econômico é insuficiente; A informação ""Renda"" e ""Despesas"" são bem genéricas o que faz você ficar sem muito chão pra pisar quando o problema é melhorar a economia. Para o jogo que é e pelo que o jogo propõe acho que uma micro administração de finanças seria, e ao meu ver é, muito necessário.

Como fã da Kalypso Media eu venho acompanhando seu trabalho a muitos anos, desde AIRLINE TYCOON em 1998, TROPICO em 2001, PATRICIAN e PORT ROYALE, etc... Entre outros jogos de outras empresas como DEMOCRACY, WALL STREET TRADER 2001, THE GUILD e tantos outros jogos, como já dito para publicos bem expecíficos que gostam deste tipo de Gênero político; Tanto quanto jogos como EURO TRUCK, FLIGHT/TRAIN/FARM SIMUATOR são jogos para um publico bem específico. 
Urban Empire está tentando levar o gênero político para um novo patamar que nunca havia existido, um jogo político feito com mais verba e profundidade do que jamais feito.",

Wie man natürlich schon am Thumb-Down erkennen kann, wird dieses Review nicht zum positiven ausfallen.
Was aber nicht bedeutet, dass die Spielidee schlecht ist. Negative Punkte einzelner Themen führten letztendlich
zu einem negativen Ergebnis. Und los gehts!

[h1][b]Thema- / Genreidee[/b][/h1]

Kalypso warb damit, dass man eine komplett neue Spielkonzeptidee mit Urban Empire auf den Markt wirft.
Nachdem man ein paar Stunden gespielt hat, fällt einem ganz schnell auf, dass dies natürlich nicht ganz richtig ist.
Die Idee eine Stadt zu verwalten ist nichts neues. Steuern erheben, Steuern senken, Budgetanpassung für öffentliche
Dienstleistungen, Nahverkehr...all das gibt es schon. Auch der Stadtrat und seine Parteien ist nicht ganz so neu.
Abstimmungen kennen wir schon aus ""Die Gilde"" und ""Patrizier"". Bei ""Die Gilde"" bestechen wir unsere Kontrahenten mit Geld, bezirzen sie mit Parfüm oder drohen ihnen einfach nur. Damit wir in ""Urban Empire"" die Parteien dazu bekommen für unser Vorhaben zu stimmen, müssen wir es fast genauso machen. Entweder wir bitten sie freundlich, fordern etwas oder bedrohen sie. Das bedrohen der Parteien funktioniert fast immer. Sie sind uns gegenüber zwar nach der Abstimmung Böse eingestellt, aber auch das legt sich ganz schnell wieder und wir können von vorne anfangen sie dumm zu machen.
Weiterhin müssen wir Zonen errichten und diese Verwalten. Dazu kann man einfach nichts interessantes sagen, da es da nicht wirklich was interessantes zu erzählen gibt.


[h1][b]Stadt und Karte[/b][/h1]

Dazu gibt es eigentlich nicht viel zu sagen. Die ansicht der Stadt ist langweilig und ermüdend. Es gibt einfach kein richtiges Leben in der Stadt und es hat den Anschein, dass Kalypso an dieser Stelle die besten Grafiker und Programmierer in den Urlaub schickten und die Azubis ran liesen. Das Team von Kalypso war anscheinend der Meinung, dass das Aussehen der Stadt und das städtische gewusel unwichtig sei. Straßenbahnen fahren einfach nur im Kreis ohne einmal anzuhalten, Die Straßen sind so gut wie leer. Wenig Autos die dann auch noch wiederholend die selbe Strecke abfahren. Das Gleiche gilt auch für die Passanten. Einfach nur lieblos gestaltet.


[h1][b]Grafik[/b][/h1]

Und hier sind wir an einem Punkt angelangt, an dem sich Kalypso schämen sollte ein Spiel auf den Markt zu bringen mit einer Grafik vergleichbar mit Spielen aus den Jahren 2003 bis 2006. Die Grafik ist so grottenschlecht, dass man das Gefühl hat, dass selbst der Spieleentwickler ""Astragon"" Games mit besserer Grafik auf den Markt bringt und das Handwerk besser versteht als Kalypso. Ich hoffe hier wird nochmal einiges Nachgebessert. Ich Spiele in Ultrahoher Auflösung auf einem 4K Monitor und findes es einfach nur schlecht. Es gibt nichts schlimmeres als wenn man heute noch bei einem Game die wiederholende Terrainstruktur sieht. 

Siehe hier:

[URL=http://www.bilder-upload.eu/show.php?file=ff4f6f-1485022287.jpg][IMG]http://www.bilder-upload.eu/thumb/ff4f6f-1485022287.jpg[/IMG][/URL]

Das einzige was ich hier positiv bewerten kann, ist das Wasser und der Übergang zu Festland. Auf dem Wasser kann man keinerlei Struktur erkennen und es sieht sehr gut aus.
Ich hääte hier einfach nur erwartet, dass die Grafikdesigner Objekte liebevoller und mit mehr Detail versehen gestaltet hätten. Eine Grafik wie im Spiel ""Cities Skyline"" wäre hier nahezu perfekt gewesen. Auch der Ratssaal ist nicht wirklich der Hit. Einige Politiker, welche hinten sitzen, sind anscheinend Hobby-Solariumgänger und für je eine Stunde Sonnenbank am Tag. Auch scheint hier alles so unscharf zu wirken.


[h1][b]Sound[/b][/h1]

Ja geht soweit.
Das einzige was ich hier wieder nicht so schön finde ist, dass ich gerne im Ratssaal gehört hätte, wenn Politiker mich ausbuhen oder Jubeln. Die Gestiken machen sie ja...aber naja. Wirkt auch hier nicht ganz fertig.


[h1][b]Bugs / Stabilität[/b][/h1]

Erstaunlicherweise muss ich sagen, dass ich bis jetzt nicht wirklich Bugs gefunden habe. Auch Aufhänger/Abstürze gab es bei mir in 13 Stunden Spielzeit keine. Einzig eine Sache muss ich bemängeln. Wenn ich eine Partei davon überzeugen möchte für mein Vorhaben zu Stimmen dann klicke ich ja zum Beispiel auf ""fordern"". Wenn ich aber dann überlege Ihnen vielleicht doch nur eine Bitte rüberzubringen oder ihnen villeicht zu drohen, dann habe ich pech. Einmal auf einen Button geklickt gibt es kein Zurück mehr. Ich muss etwas Auswählen um da wieder raus zu kommen. Warum das so ist, erklärt sich mir nicht so ganz.


[h1][b]Gameplay[/b][/h1]

Hier kann ich nichts schlechtes verlieren. Die Menüs sind meiner Meinung nach übersichtlich und nach dem spielen der Einführung auch selbsterklärend. Man findet sich sehr gut zurecht. Hier brauch ich nicht mehr zu sagen. Das wurde für dieses Spiel super umgesetzt.


[h1][b]Fazit[/b][/h1]

Kalypso bringt hier nicht wie angekündigt ein Spiel mit frischer und neuartiger Spielidee auf den Markt.
Jedoch kann man nicht sagen, dass dieses Spiel keinen Spaß machen würde. Denn das tut es sogar.
Das Aussehen der Stadt wirkt langweilig und fad. Man hat das Gefühl die Stadt sei Tot und fast ausgestorben.
Mit der Grafik haben sich die Macher hier keine Lorbeeren verdient. Ganz im Gegenteil. Die Grafik erinnert an Titel von vor über 10 Jahren. Mit Abstürzen hatte ich keine Probleme und auch Bugs waren so gut wie keine vorhanden. Hierfür
ein großes Lob.

Ob ihr das Spiel nun kaufen solltet?

Puh das ist schwer zu sagen! An Eurer Stelle würde ich noch warten bis ich hier melde, dass sich die Grafik durch einen Grafikpatch verbessert hat. Für diesen Entwicklungsstand des Spiels, ist es einfach zu teuer und der Kauf lohnt sich auch nicht.

Ich hoffe ich konnte Euch einen kleinen Einblick verschaffen.

Следующие две попытки оказались лучше - выходил в ноль. Придумал теорию, что сначала надо только один район апгрейдить, а не несколько сразу. Но снова решил заново.
Последняя новая игра принесла мне удовольствие. Шесть районов, приход в бюджет под двести тысяч с переменным успехом, но всё работает. Всё идёт как нужно. Я не понимаю до сих пор как тут развивать компании (именно промышленные и магазины), но вроде что-то получается.

I wanted a more intricate mechanic based around complex relationships with the city council and citizens that reflectedin votes and decisions. This game isn't that and again that's not the game's fault. 

The concepts in the game are amazing and will probably carry the game for awhile, but after I played for a few hours I wasn't having any fun and didn't feel connected to anything in the game.

The economy was probably the biggest turnoff for me as it is spiradic at best. It appears that the only viable way to offset costs is to constantly raise taxes. I've been a part of city government for many years and it simply doesn't work this way. Several things, including state and federal funding, for infrastructure and services have been left out. The early eras are understandable in this regard however. Though adding sewage to my districts shouldn't cost me 50k per month for 2,000 people. Wtf are they eating that requires that kind of cost for sewage?!

All in all I'm sure this will be an awesome game for alot of people, but it just wasn't there for me. I wish there was a ""meh"" recommendation on Steam. Maybe Paradox will take a stab at something in this ballpark eventually. Ended up refunding.","This wasn't really what I expected. I don't blame the game for that at all.

- Debes tener un nivel alto de inglés (hay vocabulario de un nivel C1), o al menos, tenor un traductor cerca para ir comprendiendo la dinámica de juego. No está disponible en español.
- Se trata de un simulador de política, con algunos incredientes de citybuilder. 
- Debes tomarte tu tiempo dentro de un juego al más puro sistema de estrategia.

De qué va: en sí se trata de escoger una familia, la cual tienes sus características y tendencias políticas y/o visiones sobre la vida en general. Dicha familia debe mantenerse en el poder de la alcaldía o la jefatura de gobierno, intentando mantener el favor (o no) del Cosejo de la Ciudad o una cámara de respresentantes votados por los ciudadanos, sabiendo que:
- No tienes decisión sobre cómo configurar las distintas calles (como los clásico citybuilders) pero sí sobre qué tipo de zona debe regir cada distrito que tú vas creando (o te dejan crear). 
- Puedes ir seleccionando las distintas tecnologías que se van investigando y que derivan en mejoras para tu ciudad a nivel de infraestructura y de legislación.
- Tienes decisión relativa sobre cómo gestionar el presupuesto (y digo lo de relativa porque el Consejo de la Ciudad también estará a favor o no, de subidas de impuestos, pej. etc...)

No problem, just tell the leader of an opposing party that you'll ruin his career or straight out threaten to murder him and there you go, vote passed. Zone out a disctrict or build a police station?

die bewertung für dieses spiel wurde nun auf negativ geändert, da bis jetzt keine besserungen eingetreten sind und keinerlei inhalt nachgeliefert wurde. ausser einem kleinen hotfix ist seit dem erscheinungstermin nichts geschehen. das ist mir eindeutig zu wenig.
eine kalypso-vorbestellung kommt für mich zukünftig nicht mehr in frage, damit hat sich der publisher selbst ins knie geschossen.

hier nun die original erstbewertung vom 21.01.2017:

meine bewertung fällt positiv aus, da ich grundsätzlich für derartige spiele und simulationen zu haben bin. außerdem habe ich für diesen titel nur knappe € 22,- bezahlt. das möchte ich vorab erwähnt haben.

zum ablauf:

wer urban empire nur aus ankündigungen und werbungen kennt, könnte im spiel tatsächlich rasch enttäuscht werden. die absolute freiheit und das politische kalkül sind vielmehr vorgegaukelt, als fester bestandteil. dass es reiner zufall ist, wie sich der stadtrat bei abstimmungen verhält, merkt man relativ schnell. logik, politische interessen und absichten haben mit den entscheidungen so gut wie gar nichts zu tun. ein beispiel: startet man eine neue kampagne kann die mehrheit des stadtrats für die erste abstimmung ein JA geben. startet man nochmal neu, kommt dieselbe abstimmung und, warum auch immer, der rat stimmt überwiegend mit NEIN. warum, lässt das spiel hierbei völlig offen. vermutlich, weil es keine fundierten meinungen und gründe dafür oder dagegen gibt, sondern das spiel auf zufall basiert. 
mehrere spielstarts bringen mich gleich zu einem meiner größten kritikpunkte. egal, wie oft man von vorne beginnt, der verlauf bleibt an sich stets komplett gleich. damit meine ich, dass ja im lauf der zeit geschehnisse eintreten, sowohl global und lokal, als auch persönlich. all diese ereignisse passieren auch immer wieder in exakt der gleichen reihenfolge und in der selben zeitfolge. nach dem dritten spielstart bist du nicht mehr überrascht, dass deine frau nach der geburt verstirbt. der ganze handlungsstrang ist jedesmal exakt der selbe. diese tatsache kostet wahrscheinlich die meisten punkte, was wiederspielwert oder langzeitmotivation betrifft. ich finde das wirklich störend, da es schnell langweilt, wenn man nach einem völlig neuem spielstart schon im vorhinein weiß, welche ereignisse zu welchem zeitpunkt eintreten werden. es gibt dann keinerlei situation mehr, die einem überraschen oder vor ein problem stellen könnte. hat man genug wohlwollen gesammelt (was wirklich nicht schwer ist), dann bekommt man eigentlich so gut wie jeden antrag im stadtrat durch, das wird nur für die wenigsten ein problem sein, die solche spiele bevorzugen. beim ersten spielen, ein WOW!, beim zweiten durchgang ein HAHA-JETZT-HAB-ICHS-SCHLAUER-GEMACHT!, beim dritten ein JA-ICH-WEISS-SCHON-WIEDER-DASSELBE! hat mans also einmal durch, dann wird dich bei nem erneuten start nichts neues mehr überraschen, geschweigedem fordern. gefordert ist man ohnedies schon recht wenig, was die werbung eher nicht vermuten lies. natürlich gibt es zeitweise jede menge klickorgien, doch bei micromanagement lassen sich solche mechaniken nur schwer vermeiden, wie sollte man es sonst lösen? hier und da wäre feinschliff notwendig, doch im großen und ganzen ist es schon einigermaßen ok. nur leider auch immer dasselbe, darum wird auch das recht bald langweilig. seine kreativität kann man einzig und allein beim erstellen eines neuen bezirks entfalten, wenn auch nur in äußerst geringem maße. man kann die größe, die dichte, die form, den namen und die besiedlung festlegen, punkt.

allgemein tut sich im thema wirtschaft auch nicht gerade viel. man ist hier eben kein manager eines unternehmens, dieses thema ist eher lau. grundsätzlich forscht man mit wissenspunkten, die deine stadt je nach bildungsstatus gratis von selbst bereistellt und man hebt die steuern, um mehr einnahmen zu generieren. man muss die bedürfnisse seiner einwohner befriedigen, was mit den altbekannten theater, polizei, klinik, bibliothek usw zu erledigen ist. diese kann man im entsprechenden bezirk frei platzieren. folgende bedürfnisse sind zu erfüllen: sozialleben, sicherheit, stadtbild (schönheit), gesundheitsversorgung, persönliche karrierechancen, unterhaltung. mit einer reihe von gebäuden und der passenden infrastruktur (strom, licht, gas, abwasserkanäle) stellt das aber keinerlei problem dar. 

zur technik:

auf meiner midrange-maschine spielt es sich in den höchsten einstellungen problemlos, es läuft flüssig, auch wenn sich mein pc zeitweise ein wenig anstrengen muss. trotzdem alles in butter, das funktionert bei mir sehr gut.

bugs:

klar, dass man erstmal in einer art tutorial das spiel und seine mechaniken kennenlernen muss. zum derzeitigen stand rate ich aber jedem, dass er unbedingt ein neues spiel OHNE tutorial und hilfe startet, sobald er richtig loslegen will. sollte das tutorial noch aktiv sein, kann es passieren (wie bei mir und vielen, vielen anderen kunden im forum), dass man seinen spielstand nicht mehr speichern kann. das ist natürlich äußerst ärgerlich, wenn man schon 2 stunden in seine schöne stadt investiert hat und dann alles futsch ist. ebenso passiert es (auch mir), dass einzelne bezirke einfach nicht mehr anwählbar sind. das bedeutet, mann kann diese in keiner form mehr verändern, modernisieren oder ausbauen. dumm, wenn der noch aus dem 19. jahrhundert stammt und man schon in der moderne angekommen ist. die einen mögen gaslaternen nostalgisch oder romatisch finden, doch handel, bewohner und industrie deiner stadt sehen das ganz anders. sie fühlen sich unterversorgt und der bezirk wird eine finanzielle und stadtökonomische dauerbelastung sein.
weitere bugs soll es geben, traten bei mir allerdings nicht auf, ich kann dazu nichts berichten und nur an das forum verweisen.

warum eine positive beurteilung? weil ich sie nach dem 4. start verfasse und es mir noch nicht wirklich zum hals raushängt. es macht mir schon noch spaß, ich mag solche spiele eben gern. ebenfalls zu erwähnen ist, dass ich nur den halben preis (instant gaming, vorbestellung) bezahlt habe und daher ein wenig milder in meiner beurteilung bin. den vollpreis finde ich zum derzeitigen stand des spiels doch eher frech und unangemessen hoch. sooooo viel inhalt und abwechslung ist es dann bestimmt nicht, da ja die story eigentlich stets die selbe ist (egal welche familie man zum start wählt) und die ereignisse sowieso.
allerdings, der erscheinungstermin war gestern und heute kam schon ne mitteilung der entwickler ""Known issues and workarounds in Urban Empire version 1.1.1"". wenn man also davon ausgeht, dass die entwickler ernsthaft dranbleiben, dann kann man auch bedingt hoffen, dass das unausgeschöpfte potential dieses spiel vielleicht auch noch genutzt wird. davon hat es nämlich durchaus eine ganze menge. es bleibt abzuwarten...

meine empfehlung richtet sich an jene, die ebenfalls eine leidenschaft für dieses genre pflegen und auch so viel geduld haben, um es im sale für die hälfte zu kaufen. den vollpreis zu bezahlen, rate ich niemanden, man bekommt dafür einfach zu wenig. 
trotz allem ein ganz pfiffiges spiel, das in der vierten runde noch spaß bringt, hübsch aussieht und eine weile beschäftigt. nach 2x komplett durchspielen wird es dann vermutlich eher in der bibliothek verstauben, sollte es nicht bald mehr inhalte und optionen nachgeliefert bekommen. 

was mich überrascht hat: es funktioniert ganz ohne kalypso-launcher und registrierung!  :-O

FAZIT:

für genrefans eine empfehlung, die verbindlich an einen niedrigeren preis geknüpft ist. bis zu €25,- kann man meiner meinung nach dafür schon ausgeben.",

My instinct was that the current price of $40 was too high.  Unfortunately, this seems to be true. Hard to tell you exactly what's wrong, maybe the votes for even relatively minor district changes, or the lack of information and random impact of your decisions for chance events.  It's not bad and delivers some initial amusement and the concept is cool.  There is something just not quite right.

Pros:
+ Very few titles in the genre
+ What it does, mayoral simulator, it does well
+ Peaceful, layed back gameplay
+ Runs well and looks as good as it needs to be

Cons:
- Not a lot going on, there are times where you're just waiting for the time to tick by.
- The game's politics definitely tend to lean one way moreso than the other
- Difficult to tell what choices makes what changes

Neutral:
o Shallow gameplay. You make choices and hope you have enough clout to sway votes to your side. That's pretty much it in a nutshell.
o There definitely seems to be an optimal way to go about advancing your city and districts.

It's a difficult genre to make a game for as the demand is quite low. Personally I love these types of games and there are very few additions every year that are worth checking out. The problem here is that to appeal to a wider audience they tap into city building and planning elements that are just too shallow for those looking for a city builder. If you know what you're getting into before buying, it should scatch that proverbial mayoral itch.","A Refrishing Swim in a Shallow Pond

这游戏对我来说，画面优化都不是什么问题，毕竟我玩P社祖传克劳维茨引擎很多年。
但是我最不能忍的是经济系统，基本上进入下一个时代，各项需求就会突然有一个大的飞跃(为什么不能做成随着科技解锁呢)
造成的结果就是我不得不通过建更多的基础设施来提高，但是新区规划好了还要基础设施而且还是需要大量的时间才能逐渐获得利润。这之中的时间基本是挂机，一旦出现了赤字，经常这个赤字会越来越大即使我的新区收入也在不断提高(不知道是为什么)
然而你仅仅只有提高税率和减少一些设施投入的方式来解决，但是税率过高就会出现大面积破产，而减少设施收入杯水车薪且更达不到满足需求的作用，并且我也不知道这个游戏的世界市场是什么样的？经济走势的变化就仅仅是通过报纸来告诉我？游戏大半时间都在对着赤字看海，设施太贵，赚钱太难。我玩了一天通关一次，还有很多纯居民区电都没有通。

希望以后还是好好改进一下","After a day of playing, I've been struggling with the financial deficit.

For me, graphical optimization isn't a problem with this game, after all, I've been playing Paradox's legacy Clausius engine for years.

But my biggest pet peeve is the economic system. Basically, every time you enter the next era, the demands suddenly jump (why can't they be unlocked with technology?)

The result is that I have to build more infrastructure to improve things, but even after planning a new area, I still need infrastructure, and it takes a long time to gradually generate profits. This time is basically idle. Once a deficit appears, it often gets bigger, even if my new area's income continues to increase (I don't know why).

However, the only solutions you can use are raising taxes and reducing some infrastructure investment, but excessively high taxes will lead to widespread bankruptcy, and reducing infrastructure income is a drop in the bucket and will not even meet demand. I also have no idea what the global market for this game is like. Are the economic trends revealed solely through newspapers? I spend most of the game staring at the deficit. Facilities are too expensive, and making money is too difficult. I played through the game once in a day, and many purely residential areas still don't have electricity. Another issue is that this incident is a bit repetitive. My parliament has been holding up the water pollution bill for a while now, and I've seen it voted on at least 40 times, even with only a few votes in between.

The idea of ​​the parliament is good, but the results are pretty average to me. Basically, those with good connections beg for mercy, while those with bad connections use gossip to threaten them. Later, they find gossip about the opposing party and spread it, and then they lose their seat in parliament.

I hope they can improve this in the future."

《城市帝国》与其他城市建造类游戏相比增加了党派支持率这个东西，有好也有坏，具体下面再说
我上午开始玩，不到六个小时达成时间胜利（坐稳市长的位子），游戏内没有提示胜利方法都有哪些，详情可以看成就。胜利之后可以选择继续经营城市，我也不知道能不能同时达成多个胜利

游戏开始有四个家族可以选择，最前面那个人身后站的是他的后代们，每个时代换一个

我感觉游戏中最重要的东西就是钱，各个党派支不支持你建东西好像只看你有没有钱，而赚钱是游戏里最麻烦的事
不过没关系，我刚开始差点破产，然后写了封信给皇帝，用声望换了不少钱

总结一下关于钱的问题
[h1]最实用的方法[/h1] 没钱了就去调税率，别问为什么，别去想花招

税率尽量往高了调，不管是谁都要调（过高会有党派提反对法案，到时候稍微降一点就好）
调税率时尽量保持两个党派支持，并且没有党派反对，这样法案是必过的          我一直缺钱所以大部分党派都支持
长期收高税可能会导致建筑需求降低（纯属猜测，没敢冒险证实）
基础建筑能不造就不造，维护费用一个比一个高                  [spoiler]我连了个电网，立马就后悔了，连续赤字好几年[/spoiler]
设施类建筑可以升级，升级不会提高维护费用
不要想着存钱，钱没了能挣，钱存了瞬间就花完了!
个人资金可以用来跳过投票直接建造，拨款里可以提高[strike]贪污[/strike]金额
行政区能造多大造多大，维护费用高但是地方大

接下来说党派
党派影响着所有的决定，选举、建造、立法案、调税率，支持的越多，投票越容易通过
游戏内有五个时代，每个时代都会有党派出局并且有新党派加入
最开始党派只有几个，后面会有七八个
投票时每一个月可以和每个党派交流一次（恳求、要求、威胁），每次交流会提高几点支持率但是会降低好感度，所以尽量和所有党派都搞好关系。       我和几乎所有党派的关系都很好，只有基督教是0，不知道为什么
党派好感度和党派的投票立场无关，哪怕跟你关系是10，该反对他照样反对
我记得可以对某个党派进行监视，说是可以找到污点，在投票时可以拉票，然而我点了监视之后就没再管过
党派好麻烦啊，老是得点点点

最后说一些小问题
满意度、安全度那一栏的东西到底有什么用，我一进新时代就负了，负了好几个月也没发现有什么影响
游戏内部对建筑的升级一直可以点，升满了也可以点，总让人感觉还可以升级
资金补助，每次消耗一万（10k）个人资金，点到绿圈接近黄圈就没有效果了，但再点仍然扣钱
即时投票法案很多影响不显示内容
建造建筑时邮件不能移动地图，右键一拖拽我都不知道飞哪去了
即刻投票时有反对的党派，投票开始却全变成同意

个人感觉
有些简单吧，我感觉才玩到中期怎么就胜利了

总结
游戏没有道路建设，只有单的的建筑需要玩家在格子里摆放，喜欢城市设计的玩家要慎重
感觉价位偏高，希望能更新更多东西
不明白为什么会褒贬不一，我看有价值的评论都是好评

Compared to other city-building games, City Empires adds party support, which has both advantages and disadvantages. More on that below.
I started playing this morning and achieved a time victory (securing the mayoral seat) in under six hours. There's no in-game guide to victory methods; see the achievements for details. After victory, you can choose to continue managing the city. I'm not sure if you can achieve multiple victories simultaneously.

At the beginning of the game, you have four families to choose from. Behind the person at the front are his descendants, and one family changes every era.

I feel like the most important thing in the game is money. It seems that whether or not each party supports your construction depends solely on your wealth, and making money is the most difficult part of the game.

But it doesn't matter. I almost went bankrupt at the beginning, but then I wrote a letter to the emperor and exchanged a lot of reputation for money.

To summarize the money issue:
[h1]The most practical method[/h1] If you're out of money, raise the tax rate. Don't ask why, and don't try to be cunning.

Raise the tax rate as high as possible, no matter who raises it (if it's too high, one party will propose an opposing bill, so you can lower it slightly later).

When raising the tax rate, try to maintain support from two parties and no opposition from any party; this way, the bill will definitely pass. I'm always short of money, so most parties support it.

Long-term high taxes may reduce demand for buildings (pure speculation, I haven't dared to verify it).

If basic buildings can be avoided, don't build them; their maintenance costs are getting higher and higher. [spoiler] I connected to the power grid and immediately regretted it. We've been in deficit for several years straight.[/spoiler]

Infrastructure buildings can be upgraded, but upgrades don't increase maintenance costs.

Don't think about saving money; if you lose money, you can earn it back. If you save money, it's gone in an instant!

Personal funds can be used to skip votes and build directly. Appropriations can be used to increase the amount of [strike] corruption.

Administrative districts can be as large as you want. Maintenance costs are high, but the area is large.

Now, let's talk about parties.

Parties influence all decisions, including elections, construction, legislation, and tax adjustments. The more support you have, the easier it is to pass votes.

There are five eras in the game, and each era sees parties eliminated and new ones joining. There are only a few parties at the beginning, but later there are seven or eight.

Every month, you can communicate with each party (through pleading, demands, and threats) during voting. Each communication will increase your support points by a few points but decrease your favorability, so try to maintain good relations with all parties. I have a good relationship with almost all parties, except Christianity, which is 0. I don't know why.

Party favorability has nothing to do with a party's voting stance. Even if your relationship with them is 10, you'll still oppose them if you should.

I remember being able to monitor a party, supposedly to find flaws and canvass for votes, but after I clicked on the monitor option, I never bothered to do anything.

Parties are so annoying; I'm always clicking.

Finally, a few small questions.

What's the point of the Satisfaction and Security columns? They went negative as soon as I entered the new era, and I haven't noticed any impact for months.

You can always upgrade buildings in the game, even after they're maxed out, which makes it seem like there's more to upgrade.

Fundamentals... every time I spend... It costs 10,000 yuan (10,000 yuan) of personal funds. Clicking on a green circle close to a yellow circle has no effect, but clicking again still deducts money. Many instant voting bills have no effect, and the content is not displayed. Emails can't be moved on the map while building a building. I can't figure out where they go when I right-click and drag. There are opposing parties in the instant vote, but everyone agrees at the start of the vote.

My personal opinion: It's a bit simple. I feel like I won in the middle of the game.

Summary: The game doesn't have road construction, only individual buildings that you need to place on a grid. City design enthusiasts should proceed with caution. The price seems a bit high, and I hope they'll update more. I don't understand why there are so many mixed reviews. I've seen all the good reviews.

1 没有城市地图/鸟瞰图/分布图等 

尤其后期城市区块多了以后， 你想看别的区块只能拖屏幕去一个一个找 包括娱乐、安全等覆盖范围也只能点一个建筑才能看到同类建筑的覆盖圈，缺少那种直观的分类覆盖的小地图，包括有些商店破产之类的提示也很小很隐蔽，偶尔会出现，不了解满地图飘红图标为什么

2 升级没有提示

各种独特建筑比如车站码头等可以升级没有相关提示。。如果不注意相关科技内容的话很容易错过。我是第二时代过了好久偶尔想起来点了下码头才发现可以升级2次，包括社区升级也是，每个社区的新的设施比如地铁路灯等需要你去挨个点升级铺设然后塞议会。。

3 这就牵扯到游戏目前最大的不足了。。。

玩家扮演的是一个市长。。一个城市分了很多区，但是行政和改造命令必须一个区一个区来，还必须手动来点，我作为市长为什么就不能直接议会一次法令通过，把那些区的卵石路全换成石板路呢。。。一个区一个区，每个区要塞一次议会，还要等上一个区通过了，再去手选下一个区点改造内容再提交。。。完全没有必要的重复工作

4 另外游戏后期比较卡顿。。我目前大概到1911年，游戏感觉实在有些卡。。按理说16G内存应该满足游戏要求了。。应该还是优化问题",

    优点1.游戏提出的并非建筑者而是管理者的玩法很吸引人，题材新颖。
           2.中文配音翻译简直良心！这很棒，和那些甚至歧视中国人的游戏比的话不知道好到哪里去。
           3.画面整体性不错，细节很多！ 大部分贴图不错。
           4.难度整体来说不大，新手教程详细，上手简单。
           5.政治方面的玩法很有趣（和一群守财奴斗智斗勇）
           6.事件比较丰富，甚至还有关于市长私生活的事件。
           7.科技树庞大，每个时代对应的科技都有意思。 
 但是！这些只是游戏的初体验。
 在我玩到两个小时以后，进入第二阶段晚期了，这款游戏便越来越突出某些缺点了。
 缺点
  1.内容性在刚刚玩的时候感觉多到爆炸，看着金库里的收支，像貔貅的屁眼一样。但是，到了游戏中期钱的问题便不是那么困难  了，只要支出大一点，赤字几万，增多少税率都通的过，随便找个支出大一点的公共设施就可以了。然后就是花钱败家，出赤字然 后提税率，收入一下子就上去了。
2.政治方面，事件的言辞都可以判断该支持还是反对。而且前期政令不通过都先忍一下，党派好感上去了便所向披靡，就算改的太大不支持，多改几次就过了。政党的规律性很快就摸的清，又一个方面沦陷。
3.行政区的概念很不错，但是等建造几个以后便发现行政区之间没有好大的区别，区别的只是区域的名称和建筑分布而已，改变一下各类建筑的占比，公共服务的不同，便没有任何区别。
    游戏的游戏性慢慢便消失的无影无踪，取而代之的便是一味的等钱，花钱满足那帮P民的要求、再等钱，再花钱。机械而又枯燥乏味的过程。
    游戏不错，中文良心，但是游戏性没有太注重，能提供的只是那几个小时的快乐时光，再往上便觉乏味无聊。不同于一般的模拟经营类游戏，换了汤药，看上去新鲜，但是喝起来还是那个味儿，甚至有些反胃。
    这是一款50-80的游戏，不值得112这个价钱。最后我向游戏开发者致以敬意，感谢你们能尊重中国玩家。

평가, 이 게임은 일반 건설 및 경영 시뮬레이션과는 판이한 차이가 있습니다. 기타 게임들은 조건보다 선택에 집중하고 자신이 목표한 바를 이뤄내가며 성취감을 느끼는 것이지만 이 게임은 말 그대로 정치시뮬레이션입니다. 시티룰러라는 개념이 무엇인지 알게해주네요. 이 게임은 끌고가는게 아니라 이끌어내는 장르입니다. 국가의 정치처럼 주고받는 그런게 존재하지요.

팁, 1. 재정을 파탄내지 마세요.
기술이 좋고 발전하는 것에 기쁨을 느끼는 것에 집중하고싶더라도 정치인은 예산에 따라 움직이는 겁니다.
시티즈 스카이라인처럼 자신이 엠비처럼 사대강사업도 하고 강물에 세빛둥둥섬같은거 만들고 싶어도 
돈이 없으면 의원들은 무슨 안건을 디밀어도 개소리 취급할겁니다.

2. 항상 압도적인 표차로 이기려고 하지 마세요.
당신이 주장하는 바가 너무 강하면 반대파는 더욱 반대에 열을 올리게 됩니다. 애매한 태도도 좋습니다.
0.5배 차이로 투표에서 승리하는 것이 최적입니다. 당신의 호의를 아끼고 반대파에게도 큰 반발을 불러오지 않지요.

3. 권리는 왠만한 건물보다 효과가 좋습니다.
법안이나 해금되는 권리들은 효과가 좋지만 억지로 통과시키려다가는 반대파적 기조만 일으킬 수 있습니다. 의회 내에서 당신의 편이 아무도 없다면 이 게임은 말 그대로 말아먹은 판인겁니다. 당신을 지지하는 다수당이 해당 법안에 반대라면 그러한 기조에 따라가도 무방합니다. 그러나 결코 반대파를 조지려들지는 마세요. 당신이 원하는 바에  도달하지 못하고 부결된다면 천천히 정치적 이슈에 있어 호의를 쌓고서 다시 도전하세요. 주는게 있으면 오는게 있는 법이랍니다.","My personal review and tips for this game

Review: This game is completely different from typical construction and management simulations. Other games focus on choices rather than conditions, and the sense of accomplishment gained by achieving your goals is palpable. This game truly is a political simulation. It really brings home the concept of ""City Ruler."" This game is about leading, not leading. Like national politics, there's a give-and-take aspect to it.

Tips: 1. Don't bankrupt the government.
Even if you want to focus on the joy of technological advancement and progress, politicians are driven by budgets.
Like Cities: Skylines, even if you want to implement the Four Major Rivers Project and build floating islands like Sebitseom in the rivers,
without money, lawmakers will dismiss any proposals as nonsense.

2. Don't always try to win by a landslide.
If your argument is too strong, the opposition will become even more vocal. Ambiguous stances are also acceptable.
Winning by a 0.5 vote margin is optimal. They'll be more generous with your favors and won't provoke a major backlash from the opposition.

3. Rights are more effective than most buildings.
Bills and unlocked rights are effective, but trying to force their passage will only fuel opposition. If you have no allies in Congress, the game is literally a lost cause. If the majority party supports your bill and opposes it, it's okay to follow their lead. However, never try to manipulate the opposition. If your desired outcome is not met and the bill is rejected, slowly build up favor on political issues and try again. Give and receive."

BUG我就不说了，主要说一下这游戏本身的问题。

首先玩了6个小时我还是没有搞懂这个游戏的经济系统是个什么鬼，教学也没有说，游戏内也没有找到什么相应的图表，就是莫名其妙的亏，莫名其妙的赚，仿佛世界上根本不存在市场这种东西，所有物价都是上帝老爷子拍脑袋定的，我也没有找到什么和进出口有关的东西。所以一旦亏本了，除了提高税率之外就没有其他办法了，然后就恶性循环了。工厂亏本——>提高税率——>工厂继续亏本——>继续提高税率——>爆炸，这是只玩了6个小时的我对这游戏的经济系统的理解。

然后呢，这游戏干什么事情都要被议会批准，我对民主不反感啊，但是这游戏的民主太蠢了点。先不说这游戏的POP少的可怜，关键是我不知道这议会的构成和我的POP有什么关系，我根本不知道那八成的保守派是怎样被选上来的。然后这帮保守派，无论什么议案通通反对，可以，这很保守。你不让我开国企，行，你倒是找几个资本家给我修基建啊，现在这样子社会完全陷入停滞了，除了看海啥都干不了。祝你们这帮卢德分子全家爆炸。

然后，既然这游戏时间跨度这么大，我还以为两次世界大战的时候我的城市各方面会受到很大影响，甚至战火会波及到我的城市，如果这样子的话还是挺有意思的，但是是我想太多。

总之这游戏作为一个内政管理的游戏，要不然是这游戏的系统太迷，要不然是我太蠢玩不懂，我觉得后者的可能性大一点。

最后说一下本地化吧，这游戏的本地化无疑是做的非常好的，但是我想给评测应该专注于游戏本身的素质，而不是本地化或者优化这种细枝末节的问题，我还要吐个槽，给科技配音的那个男声太有气无力了，而且还棒读，应该学学野蛮6那个字正腔圆的配音的，虽然那个也是棒读。",

   2. 增加政黨好感的事件頻率低，你基本上只能有負數的好感度，再慢慢等它上升至「好感基礎」值
3. 就是懇求那些反對黨也是會降好感度 (╯‵□′)╯︵┴─┴)
(建議：可增加事件或行動影響「好感基礎」值，或好感度偏離基礎值太多對「好感基礎」值有影響)

- 某些政策或法案的影響沒有詳細列明，根本上不知道有多大成效，甚或不知道有什麼用...

- 遊戲自由度較低(城市建設方面)，而且隨機事件的系統略感單薄，不能明顯感受到事件的影響
(事件變化較少，而且我的政治聲譽有一百四十多，扣我10點也沒啥分別啊，
而且「個人特徵」增加「孤獨」+2也不見有什麼影響...=>就是說我是毒男嗎(╯‵□′)╯︵┴─┴  )

- 反覆的操作以及單薄的隨機事件導致遊戲深度不足，沒有令人上癮的原素

- 說好的繁體中文呢?那是簡體中文啊!!!!! (之後開發商移除了繁體中文，這跟詐騙沒分別)

P.S. 如果你是想玩類似Cities Skylines的城市營造遊戲，Urban Empire應該不是你想要的遊戲，它的城市畫面完全比不上其他城市營造遊戲，而遊戲玩法上更類於策略類的政治模擬遊戲，作為策略遊戲還算是可以接受，建議特價才買，本人認為遊戲性不值HKD 219

--------更新---------
當初是看見製作團隊有嘗試去修複一些bugs及改善遊戲，想著他們會去改善遊戲的缺點，便推薦這遊戲，順便等開發人員改善遊戲性，但這麼一等就兩個月了…如果開發團隊就這樣把遊戲放置了，那只好把好評收回，直至開發團隊正視玩家的負評。

--------更新---------
離上次更新快四個月了，開發團隊應該完全放棄了這個遊戲，我回報過的問題也沒有回覆。如果這個遊戲沒有減價，請不要購買，除非你認為這個價錢值得購買一個玩幾個小時就會悶的遊戲。",

le jeu est bon dans ce qu'il présente à la base et il a de bonnes idées, mais après avoir essayé les 4 familles jusqu'à l'ère 5, j'ai remarqué beaucoup de lacunes:

1) Mauvaise compréhension des répercussions des choix: la motiié du temps on a du mal à savoir ce que va faire y ou x chose

2) Obligé de jouer une république sociale avec un taux de taxation super elevé: je comprends mal l'intérêt de l'échiquier politique puisque dès l'ère I et II on est amené a faire du progressisme; et à taxer à tout instant car on tombe dans le rouge pour un oui ou pour un non, et on se retrouve à l'ère V avec une ville qui taxe à 50% pour fonctionner.

3) Le jeu a une certaine difficulté qui est rebutante: Au bout de 3 parties on finit par faire les choses dans le même ordre car on maximise nos revenus; ce qui casse ceux qui comme moi essaient de jouer un peu Rp avec les familles qu'ils prennent, chaque famile étant en fait un mode de diffculté:
Les premiers augmentant la sécurité et étant fidèle à l'empire font que l'ère I et II sont assez simple, pour ensutie être injouable
Les Saint Ellas donnent une courbe facile dans le sens ou de l'ère I à l'ère IV ils sont facile à jouer
Les irlandais sont très durs à partir de l'ère III 
Et les derniers ont une courbe difficile jusqu'aux ères IV-V où le jeu devient soudainement plus facile

4) Les objectifs de victoire sont à la limtie de l'impossible, à part tenir jusqu'à l'ère V

5) Jeu très lent et très long; j'aruais apprécié qu'on puisse décider à quelle ère commencer.

6) Je veux bien que les services soient payant, mais pourquoi nous font-ils perdre de l'argent ? les gens ne paient pas l'eau et l'electricité d'une ville ? Cela est illogique.

Je souhaite vraiment des ajustements; notemment sur la difficulté inspportable de ce jeu; quand on arrive à tomber dans le rouge sans raison particulière, quand le conseil préfère multiplier les quartiers au lieu d'augmenter la densité de ceux existant. Et aussi le manque de moyen de revenus, j'aurais aimé faire une société capitaliste où le peuple créé la richesse, mais je finis par faire du socialisme voire du communisme sur chaque partie si je désire ne pas avoir de problème financier",

29399441,english,2017.00.21 18:53,❌,✅,0.7524780631,52,"This game is a fun take on city management. You don't have to micromanage your city building, that pretty much happens by itself. Instead you need to convince the City Council to approve your plans for the city. You need to handle the various political parties, choose to compromise with them or support one of them and aim to help them win the majority of votes. The political simulation is interesting, and the whole game depends on how you handle it. However, there are weaknesses to this system (more on that later)

Also, newer buildings, laws/edicts and upgrades are unlocked through research and a tech tree. The tech tree seems a bit small I think. In 20 minutes gameplay I already went through 1/5th of the tech tree with only 2 schools built (schools generate research points among other things). Nonetheless, the way it's set up is interesting and has good potential for further development.

A big part of the game are events. If you play any Paradox grand strategy games you know what I mean by events. Occasionally something will happen that will require your attention. You will be presented with a problem and 3 solutions (on average). It both gives flavor to the game and allows for roleplaying. It also lends replayability, as depending on your choices you will probably end up going through a much different story each time. Events can serve to introduce new laws and edicts. Further, each technology will give you at least one event while it's being researched, related to it.

So far the game runs smoothly, no bugs or problems. It's a bit slow on loading screens, but that's not such a big deal.

My main issue is that I bought this game because it promises a deep political simulator, but I don't feel it delivers on that. On the surface everything seems interesting and good, but once you get into it, problems start appearing. As advertised, for everything you try to do in the city (new buildings, tax reform, laws/edicts, new districts, introducing gas and electricity etc) you will need the City Council's approval to actually do it. The problem is that political parties hardly exhibit any intelligence. The main factor for their decision making is if the proposed plan will take your city's budget to negative. There is no consideration for projected profit. There is very little adherence to ideologies presented in the political spectrum.

For example, the simplest problem: You need to increase your income. The best way to do it is to build new districts and increase taxes. Tax increases are suprisingly easy to pass but they are not enough alone to let you develop your city. At most you can support 2-3 buildings with a 10% increase in taxes. So you need to build new districts, but this projects a tremendous drain on your budget. With a school, a police station and an electrical grid, the running cost goes to -80K money. With 1 district already built, the best you can do is +20-30K income, for which you need to spend a lot of political power to get. Getting the Council to let you build a new district is nigh impossible and tedious. The only solution is to sit and watch your single district for some time, doing nothing, just so you can gain enough political capital to implement a change. And after that it's again spending a lot of time doing nothing.

There are 3 stances you can take with each party (Plead, Demand, Threaten). Each one will give you some options on what you can do. It seems what each choice does is random. There's little apparent consistency or reason with each choice. Furthermore, whatever you click in this interaction, there's no going back. You can't examine your options for example. If you click Threaten, that's what you'll do. No cancel or go back buttons implemented.

This wouldn't have been an issue if:

a) There were regular methods to regain political power (goodwill) with the various parties and councilmen, instead of waiting for them to tick up. (For example, certain proposals, laws and buildings should be favored by certain parties by default, especially if they cater to their values).

b) The parties actually had more detailed scripted behaviors and they took into consideration the gains each project would confer. (Almost everything is for the sake of money. My councilmembers apparently hate the idea of police stations, street lamps and hospitals because they aren't free).

c) There was a way to bundle proposals together. For example, build a new hospital and accompany it with a tax increase to overcome the budget issues.

My other issue with the game is that it doesn't have edge scrolling. Meaning you can't stick your mouse on the edge of the screen and expect the map to move. You need to click and drag with the right mouse button, or use WASD to move around. It's inconvenient and a weird design decision.

The game also seems to only offer 3 maps to play on, and I don't see any way to randomly generate maps or create a custom game with a custom family. You can only play campaign or narrow scenarios. The lack of customization is disappointing to say the least.

If and when these issues are fixed consider picking up this game. Without these problems I'd highly suggest it. It's otherwise a very fun game, with good atmosphere, well-done graphics, nice music, interesting mechanics and great potential. Until then, I suggest you wait a while and check back later.","This game is a fun take on city management. You don't have to micromanage your city building, that pretty much happens by itself.

You essentially play as the mayor of an Austrian town. You get to choose between four families. After you choose your family and your starting era (you are locked to 1820 starting date from first playthrough) you then choose the map... there are THREE MAPS. THREE. That's it! There's next to no variation! Extremely dissapointing from a $44CDN title. Moving on.

You get into the game, and within an hour I noticed the absolute lack of content. The hyped up tech tree was very shallow, with maybe 15 techs at the final era. Services are very shallow, essentially you just plop them down and make people happy in a certain radius. City expansion/district placing is very shallow too. You draw a district (it has to be pretty square, too) then decide what percentage is industrial, commercial, or residential. Then, it goes to a vote which comes down to: if you have plenty of money, council votes unanimous yes. If you don't have that much, unanimous no. Then plop, the district is there if the vote passes, and within a minute it just fills up like that. Very underwhelming.

Which brings me to the voting system, the voting is very poorly done. The best way I can describe the political system in this game is if you took edicts and taxes from Cities: Skylines, made them a slight bit more mature, and throwing a shitty voting system in the way, which you have to jump around. Essentially, there are a bunch of council members, a few parties, and you gotta get them to vote your side by threatening (which costs political favours and ALWAYS succeeds in moving them to your side), demanding (which costs political favours and ALWAYS succeeds in moving them to your side), or pleading (which costs political favours and ALWAYS succeeds in moving them to your side). Then the vote passes, or it doesn't and you simply try again. It's a boring system and it's a shame for a game which is nearly entirely built around this bland system.

[b]TL;DR[/b]: Don't buy this game. It is shallow, and does a very poor job with the voting system which it markets so heavily.

Yes you can issue a few edicts , the research trees are reasonably interesting ,but again gets boring FAST.

music is tedious and boring after 2 minutes , now switched off for good.

edit...Now 10 hours into it and as the shuskys family it does change a little bit in era 4 i wont spoil it incase people want to play it , but not enough to dramaticly change gameplay.Reviews still coming in on online sites and are pretty poor .Mixed is fair ,Needs a bit of a re think and some FREEEE UPDATES due to the massive price for a half standard game","Damn so close

A list of negative things I noticed, in no particular order,
- The camera movement is strange, it pivots on a point too far ahead of your view (for my liking anyway).
- The game lags badly as you get further into the game.
- The game becomes repetitive and the challenges remain the same as you play through.
-  [strike]There is little replay value as events always seem to have the same outcome. So it becomes a more about memorisation than judgement. [/strike]
       (I was wrong about this, it's not the case.)
- There is a lot of information, but presented in a way in which it's hard to keep a track of.
- There is little to no contextual information or feedback when you make decisions.
- The opposing political parties feel hollow, the game is about balancing numbers, but it shouldn't feel like it as you do it.
- And weirdly, the game hogs computer resources for some time after its shut down.

This isn't to say it's not worth considering, it's a marvellous idea. Much of it is well done, the graphics are pleasant, the game does well to make it feel like you are advancing through time, the economic system is both detailed and robust and the technology tree is particulary well designed.

I do like it, but if I made the choice again whether to buy it, I'd say no thanks.

Edit: More niggles
-------------------------

- There isn't any way to locate a specific industry, you can see if a district has it, but either hovering over a factory type in the list needs to highlight them, or else there at least needs to be some other way to find them, rather than just clicking on every building until you find it.
- In the scenarios there is little feedback to how well you are doing, for example, in the scenario where you have to build x amount of weapons to prepare for war, there is no easily accesible feedback on how many you have actually made or at what rate you are making them.
- Minor events show up in the corner of the screen on a timer, it's easy to miss them if you're not looking at the bottom corner of the screen at the time.","Honestly, this is a reluctantly negative review.

[*][b] 時代正確的政黨理念 [/b]
每個時代都有不同的主要政黨。

[*][b] 有好的財政才容易推動建設 [/b]
當你需要建設的時候，若財政體質狀況不佳，就連基本支持該措施的政黨也會反對。

[*][b] 新科技帶動發展 [/b]
科技會帶動行政區的發展，增加住、行、育、樂、工、商的水準，當然每次需要更動行政區才能應用新科技。

[*][b] 投票不需要絕對多數 [/b]
適時使用一些伎倆來迫使一些政黨投下同意票來推動政策，但是請注意使用這些伎倆將會造成政黨對你的不滿。

[*][b] 不甩你的政黨依舊不甩你 [/b]
當你的被黑到發亮時，你還會在乎會被黑嗎？當然在遊戲中的政黨也是，對你好感度-8以後，不甩你就是不甩你，但是別灰心，時間可以抹平一切。

[*][b] 臭蟲滿天飛 [/b]
你有看過語言只要回到主選單就會自動切換的嗎？很幸運地你有幸可以看到這個狀況，當你用簡中玩遊戲想回到主畫面時，就會好心的幫你切換回英文，讓你好好學習英文單字。你有看過對話框不能按選項的嗎？你運氣很好，在這款遊戲中你突然噴出兩個選項視窗時，有機會進入最上層選單是不能按的狀況。

[*][b] 不能規劃即規劃 [/b]
這款遊戲中能規畫的就只有畫行政區，網格密度，你說你想自己畫道路和自己規劃工商住宅區？很抱歉，這款會讓你失望。

[*][b] 能規劃的只有政治 [/b]
遊戲最大的特色不是規劃城市，城市所帶來的稅收是附加的，你真正在玩的其實是政治。","[quote][h1]2017 Political Amateur Mayor Simulator[/h1]

Can a mayor without the support of a political party

continue to build?

Can a mere mortal surpass Taipei

and become a super-Taipei mayor?

Highly recommended by someone.

[h1]Written as ""Urban Empire,"" read as ""Political Kidnapping""[/h1]

[*][b] The Correct Political Party Philosophy of the Era[/b]
Each era has its own major political parties.

[*][b] Construction Easier with a Strong Finance[/b]
When you need to build, if your finances are weak, even the political parties that generally support the initiative will oppose it.

[*][b] New Technology Drives Development[/b]
Technology drives the development of administrative districts, improving the standards of housing, transportation, education, entertainment, industry, and commerce. Of course, administrative districts must be changed each time to implement new technology.

[*][b] Voting doesn't require an absolute majority [/b]
Use tactics to coerce certain political parties into voting in favor of your policies, but be aware that using these tactics will only cause them to become dissatisfied with you.

[*][b] A party that ignores you will still ignore you [/b]
When you're being trolled to the point of being smeared, do you still care? Of course, the same applies to political parties in the game. After your favorability rating drops to -8, they'll ignore you. But don't lose heart, time will heal everything.

[*][b] Bugs are everywhere [/b]
Have you ever seen the language automatically switch when you return to the main menu? Luckily, you're lucky enough to see this happen. When you're playing in Simplified Chinese and want to return to the main screen, it'll kindly switch back to English so you can practice your vocabulary. Have you ever seen a dialog box where you can't click options? You're in luck. In this game, when two options windows suddenly appear, there's a chance that the top menu is unavailable.

[*][b] Planning is the only thing you can plan in this game. [/b]
The only things you can plan in this game are administrative districts and grid density. You said you wanted to draw your own roads and plan your own commercial and residential areas? Sorry, this game will disappoint you.

[*][b] The only thing you can plan is politics. [/b]
The biggest feature of this game isn't planning cities. The taxes generated by cities are additional. What you're really playing is politics."

Если речь вести о ней как о градостроительном симуляторе, то она слабая - при формировании района Вы выбираете плотность сети дорог, плотность застройки, наличие инфраструктуры, ставите ключевые постройки. Все, дальше район живет своей жизнью, Вы изредка может захотите в эту жизнь внести небольшие изменения, в виде установки фонарей на улице. Жизнь нулевая - просто формальные машинки создают вид, что там есть жизнь. Как политический симулятор тоже слабо - партии голосуют по простому принципу (если партия за, то все за, если партия против, то все против, если партия не определилась, то 50% за и 50% против), варианты влияния на партия ограничены двумя (с небольшими вариациями) - убедить или шантажировать. Периодически выбирается исследование в ветке исследований. И, собственно говоря, все - больше об игре рассказать нечего, потому что там больше ничего нет.

Я сначала расстроился, что в игре нет свободного режима, а потом понял - там для него ничего нет. В игре все решает только компания, если бы не компания со своем направлением логических задач, смысла не было бы в чем-то однотипно убеждать партии и ставить однотипные райончики. У меня поэтому есть подозрение, что реиграбельность этого продукта, после того как компания будет окончена, нулевая - смысла раз за разом проходить одно и тоже нет, пусть даже за какую-нибудь другую семью, на другой карте.

Графика размытая на ""максимальном"", я ожидал увидеть графику уровня Тропико 4 (по скринам), а не просто мазню. Но графика для этой игры может и правда не самое важное, проблема в том, что смотреть не на что - нет даже небольшого желания смотреть на город крупным планом, потому что там все мультяшное, размытое и пустое с редкими машинками. Музыка атмосферная, хорошая. Контента в виде случайных событий мало - у меня случайное событие повторилось уже через 1,5 часа игры.

Я не знаю даже стоит ли возвращать деньги или все же поиграть еще и оставить себе, но я считаю эту игру одноразовой - на день поиграть. Я почти уверен, что после этих выходных к ней никогда не вернусь уже. Да, один разок сыграть в нее будет интересно и все.

1、标示不清。在2017年还有这么难找标示的游戏还是很难见到的。例如，游戏中你很难知道自己的城市开销都划到了什么地方，想要削减开支也是很困难的。并且呢，升级了科技以后，居然没有一个界面能集中升级设施，而要你一个设施一个设施去点，去找着自己来升级。这么不方便的游戏，确实现在已经很少见了。

2、强行通过法案。游戏中其实你是没办法自行决定自己的城市发展成什么样子的，因为很多事情一定会有人提出来，而且整个城市的人都支持。

3、政党分别很小。只要跟你好感够，政党去向什么都是废的，基本都会赞同你的看法。

4、后期重复劳作感非常强烈，研究一大堆科技在表面上什么也看不出来，而且也没有什么设施能够升级。",

维多利亚版模拟城市。冲着政党、阶级这些内容买的。感觉实际上并没有想象中的那种展开。。。想玩个正常的城市建设游戏建议出门右转城市天际线，内容更多，系统更完善，版本也更成熟一点。当然这个游戏还是有特别的地方的



+体验时代变更。
游戏从维多利亚时代开始，展现的是一个日新月异的世界。天然气、自来水、电车、电力、电话一个个从无到有。原本朴素单调的产业逐渐迈向复杂，经济体系日益丰满，市民的生活标准水涨船高，玩家面对的是这么一个挑战：用一把不断变锋利的矛去刺穿不断变坚硬的盾，而矛与盾之间的复杂互相影响的关系又需要玩家恰当的把握。当时世界上的世界格局作为游戏背景也在游戏中有不同程度的展现。从开始的奥地利帝国，到奥匈帝国，再到帝国内民族主义蔓延地区相继独立，再到一战二战等等等等。当然，这些时代背景在目前游戏中并没有什么卵用。除了议会里的政党会越来越多以外似乎对你的经营没什么影响，哦，殖民地独立以后就有可能被议会罢免市长了。其他的就连“一战爆发后军工产业需求大增”“奥匈帝国成立后保守派实力大减”这种似乎是理所当然的展开并没有。

+家族养成。
每个家族都有不同的养成路线，各家族会有不同的传统，譬如银行家家族第二代开始都有名流属性；另一方面每一任家族领袖都时不时会碰到各种教养后代的事件，不同的选择会给后代带来不同的影响，将来成为风格不一的市长。虽然目前特性的作用还是太有限，养成事件也太少，而且养成一个特性太慢了，往往到了退休的时候还没养出什么特性来……

+/-需求系统。
跟P社游戏维多利亚2一样，产业发展源于需求也取决于需求。随着时代的改变、你做的选择不同城市里的需求会又不一样的发展：譬如造纸业会在最开始迅猛发展但是几十年后就过了黄金时代，开始衰弱；譬如蜡烛厂，往往是初期最大的产业之一，但是开始普及电力以后就迅速衰弱。这些还是蛮有意思的。游戏里也有一定程度上的阶级不同需求不同的设定，譬如精英阶级在第二时代就开始开汽车，第三时代开始买高档电器，下层阶级就消费不起。我最开始期待的是：根据你城市内阶级构成不同，产生不同的商品种类和数量需求，发展出不同的支柱产业。像维多利亚2里那样贵族阶级穿着华服在游艇上坐在高档家具里端着玻璃杯喝红酒，而工人阶级穿粗布衣服在低档酒吧里喝劣质烈酒这样的展开。但城市帝国里有差别的需求实在太少了，而且早晚会普及到百姓家里，导致这个系统其实有点鸡肋，在玩的时候除了科技进步以外，需求方面基本没什么必要去关注。

+/-政治-经济把控。
可以说刚开始玩这游戏还是很容易崩盘的。一开始很容易因为迅速推行工厂安全标准、禁烟禁酒之类的法案导致需求迅速下滑，税收又没有拉高，瞬间财政崩溃。财政一崩，基本上议会就不会再同意你在已经赤字的情况下再去投资。这点跟维多利亚2还是很相像的，然后你也得跟维多利亚2一样死命拉需求。建码头火车站，减需求的政策全废除，增加就业等等等等，甚至说“拨款给学校来增加雇员来减少失业来增加需求来增加税收”这种南辕北辙的事情也时不时要做。不过一旦城市上了轨道这游戏就变枯燥了，钱多的花不完，定期给道路升升级，随便点几个法案增加幸福度就行了。我现在就处于一种麻木的状态，议会里在弄什么法律我已经没兴趣去看了。。反正一个个通过就国泰民安了。

-政党系统。
开始时候最吸引我的就是这个。拍马屁、威胁、监听，平衡各方势力，送自家党派上台。然而实际上单调的很……在议会拉票，请求、要求、威胁三个选项其实没差别，都是消耗好感换选票，你也不用在乎什么党上台，什么党需要遏制，对于你的运营并没有多大差别。而且运营没什么太大问题的话你做的事情都没人反对，投票其实就是走个过场，浪费你5个月时间（不花威望就是十个月）。在这5个月里你还不能做出别的新规划，很卵痛。可能现在能表现党派争执的只是决定经济集中度（就是税收）、后期推进社会福利的时候吧。反正我是除了税收干啥都通过，同性恋法、女权、普选这种我以为要起争议的法案推进起来都毫不费力。

-繁琐的操作&不科学的用户界面。
不是很明白为什么这么多功能要设定成一定要进入“改建区域”才能进行。比如造个学校医院这种跨区域有效的设施，比如改个区名这么简单的事情，你都得点进改建区域，把区域概况过一遍才能提上议程。配合上5个月/10个月才能规划一次的设定，简直神烦。游戏是想把每一次规划都弄得“正式”一点，但实际带来的体验太繁琐了。

6.5/10","After some thought, I'm going to give it a negative review. While it's not unfun, the majority of Chinese reviews are positive, which is clearly overstated. I'd like to offer an objective perspective.

I bought the Victorian version of SimCity for the political parties and class structure. It didn't quite unfold as I imagined... If you want a more regular city-building game, I recommend turning right and checking out Cities: Skylines. It has more content, a more complete system, and a more mature version. Of course, this game still has its unique qualities.

+Experience the changing times.
The game begins in the Victorian era, depicting a world undergoing rapid change. Natural gas, running water, trams, electricity, and telephones emerged from nowhere. Once simple and monotonous industries gradually grew in complexity, the economy flourished, and citizens' living standards soared. The player faces the challenge of piercing an ever-hardening shield with an ever-sharpering spear, while the complex interplay between the spear and the shield requires careful manipulation. The world order of the time is also reflected in the game's setting to varying degrees. From the Austrian Empire to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, to the spread of nationalism within the empire and the subsequent independence of regions, to World War I and World War II, and so on. Of course, these historical settings are currently useless in the game. Aside from the increasing number of political parties in parliament, they seem to have little impact on your operations. Oh, and after a colony becomes independent, you might be dismissed by parliament. Even seemingly obvious developments like ""demand for the military industry surged after the outbreak of World War I"" and ""conservative power waned after the establishment of the Austro-Hungarian Empire"" are missing.

+ Family Development.

Each family has a different development path and distinct traditions. For example, the second generation of a banker family has celebrity attributes. Furthermore, each family leader will occasionally encounter various events related to the upbringing of their offspring. Different choices will have different impacts on their descendants, resulting in different styles of mayors. Currently, traits are still too limited, development events are too few, and the development of a trait is too slow, often leaving you with nothing by the time you retire...

+/- Demand System.

Like Paradox's Victoria 2, industrial development is driven by and dictated by demand. As the eras change and the choices you make, the demands of different cities will develop differently. For example, the paper industry will initially flourish, but after a few decades, it will pass its golden age and begin to decline. For example, candle factories are often one of the largest industries in the early stages, but they will decline rapidly after the spread of electricity. These are quite interesting. The game also has a certain degree of class-specific demand. For example, the elite class starts driving cars in the second era, and starts buying high-end appliances in the third era, while the lower classes can no longer afford them. I initially hoped that the class composition of your city would generate different demand for different types and quantities of goods, and develop different pillar industries. Like Victoria 2, where the aristocracy wears fine clothes, sits on yachts among fine furniture, and drinks red wine by the glass, while the working class wears coarse clothes and drinks low-quality spirits in low-end bars. However, the differentiated demands in City Empire are too few, and they will eventually spread to ordinary people, making this system a bit useless. Besides technological progress, there is little need to pay attention to demand during the game.

+/- Political-Economic Control
It's easy to get lost in this game at first. Rapidly enacting laws like factory safety standards and anti-smoking and anti-alcohol laws can lead to a rapid decline in demand, and without raising taxes, you'll end up in a financial meltdown. Once the fiscal deficit collapses, Parliament will essentially refuse to approve further investment even when you're already running a deficit. This is very similar to Victoria 2, and just like in Victoria 2, you have to desperately boost demand. Building docks and train stations, abolishing policies that reduce demand, increasing employment, and so on. You'll even have to resort to counterproductive tactics like ""giving money to schools to increase employment, reduce unemployment, increase demand, and increase taxes."" Once your cities are established, however, the game becomes dull. With more money than you can spend, you just need to regularly upgrade your roads and randomly approve a few bills to increase happiness. I'm now completely numb and have no interest in watching what laws are being worked on in Parliament. As long as they're passed, peace and prosperity will prevail.

-Party system.
This was what initially captivated me. Flattery, threats, surveillance, balancing power, and bringing your own party to power. However, it's actually quite monotonous... In parliamentary canvassing, the three options of requesting, demanding, and threatening are essentially the same: they all cost you favorability in exchange for votes. You don't have to worry about which party is in power or which needs to be curbed; it doesn't make much of a difference to your operations. Furthermore, if there aren't any major operational issues and no one objects to your actions, the vote is essentially a formality, wasting five months (ten months without the prestige cost). During those five months, you can't make any new plans, which is a real pain. Perhaps the only time partisanship is evident right now is when deciding economic concentration (taxation) and later on, when implementing social welfare. Anyway, I get everything passed except taxes. I easily pushed through bills I thought would be controversial, like gay laws, women's rights, and universal suffrage.

- Complicated operation and unscientific user interface.
I don't understand why so many functions require entering a ""renovation zone"" to function. For example, building a cross-regional facility like a school or hospital, or something as simple as changing a district name, requires entering a renovation zone and reviewing the district overview before putting anything on the agenda. Combined with the requirement to only plan once every five or ten months, it's incredibly annoying. The game tries to make every planning session more formal, but the experience is simply too cumbersome.

This is a boring game, which feels like you're pulling 3-4 levers every few minutes to see what happens.  

As background, I like and enjoy complicated strategy games.  Some of my favourites are the Crusader Kings and Europa Universalis series.  I also have sunk many hours into the political and dynasty aspects of The Guild series.  I like these types of games.  I saw a preview and was excited at the idea of a ""mayor simulation"" with some background politics and influencing political parties.  Sounds like a fantastic idea for a game.

This game is none of that.

1.  You'll see a lot of negative reviews with respect to the town planning.  I can appreciate that it is not a city builder.  It wasn't meant to be; however, town councils (county councils), etc have planning offices and engage in town planning.  This is nothing like that.  It's very basic, akin to what you'd find on a mobile phone app.  

You select a district and you can only use % to determine whether it's industry, business or residential. You don't select where the individual neighbourhoods are.  So which ""blocks"" in your district are I B or R, is really up to the game and not you.  This is a weird design choice.  

You put some important buildings, eventually, like police station or courthouse and you can wire it up for gas or sewers, for example, but this is mostly done by just clicking a ""tick"" and hoping the council agrees with you.  It's very basic and not at all enjoyable to watch your city grow, because you've had little to do with it.  This is the opposite experience of the town planning aspect of ""Banished"" for example (which is rather fun to watch the town grow.)

2. You don't create your family.  Yes, this was discussed in the previews so this is only a minor criticism.  Yes, they said it was pre-scripted.  It's worth noting though, that when they say pre-scripted, they mean it.  It has so-called 1000 dynamic events, but none of this really seemed like it couldn't have been done without creating your own family and style.  CK does it.  Anyway, doesn't matter, just poorly thought out in my opinion.

The families you choose are typical tropes.  So you have the villainous and cruel aristrocat party, which of course has ""von"" in the name.  You've some weird stage-irish sounding name and that's the family that's all into working class and unions.  You've the mysterious Russians and then you've a family that's all about science.  How many science dynasties have you read about?  Anyway, it's just trope and as bad as it sounds (the specifics of the families, as in how stereotypical they were actually going to be, was not in the promos.  It's worse than anything you've read.)  I find this to be an immersian killer, your opinion may vary.

3.  The political parties in this fictional town are irritating and seemingly pointless.  Yes, they sit on the spectrum of conservative/liberal and right/left and some mish-mash inbetween.  They have histories that you won't care about.  They are name.  You won't interact with any party leader, for example, as everything is abstract.  

Most of your interactions will be with three buttons.  ""Plead/Demand/Threaten"".  That's it.  You click one and then a dialogue menu comes up.  Once you click one, even if you don't like the dialogue, that's tough.  You have to make a choice of the options, which is 1-2, 1-3, or sometimes 1-4.  What the options do, seems to be an arbitrary mystery.  Sometimes the tooltip popup says, most the time it doesn't.

In any event, it's bizarre.  Let's say a topic of Child Labour arises and one of these parties puts the edict to outlaw child labour before the council.  You will get a pop-up that essentially asks if you will support or oppose this edict.  Let's say you pick oppose.  You then will contact all the political parties, through those 3 aforementioned buttons.  Here's a great example of a lazy design choice...

I'm opposing this.  I want the edict banning child labour to be voted down.  YET all my interactions with the political parties will ask the parties to vote YES.  Like one of the options is ""YES WE NEED THIS"", where I am actually saying ""no"".  If you click it, it behaves like you're asking them to say no and the sliders adjust accordingly, but the actual strings that appear lazily still have the positive messages.  The whole game is like this, which makes it a pain to play.  So I'm asking the parties to vote no, but all the options are telling them to vote yes, but when I click on them it behaves as if I was asking them to vote no.  Clever huh?

The interactions are very abstract.  You can bully them, but it doesn't do anything more than move a slider.  It doesn't feel like I'm being a jerk mayor or hard-line bully.  I don't feel like I'm Mayor Daly from Chicago.  None of that.  It's abstract.  The way the numbers work, everything regresses to the mean, so as long as you're not constantly a bully, you're swiftly forgiven.

4. As a mayor/political sim this is the most boring game I have ever played.  There's nothing to do of any interest.  It's just tedious.  

It tries to insert child-like humour into an otherwise seriously presented game.  I hate that when developers think that's clever.  Certain developers can pull it off, such as in Fallout or Baldur's Gate, because it's cleverly done.  Here's an example:-

I'm trying to get an edict passed, and one of the threats to the conservative party is to say to them ""Agree with me otherwise you'll be known as the conservaTARD party.""  Classy.

5.  This feels primarily like running a business sim on a phone app.  It's cosmetic and veneer feeling.

6. Nothing you do is very exciting.  I pressure the council to try to get a train station built in a pre-determined location.  They say no.  I wait about five minutes and I ask them again.  This time my bullying suceeded.  Uhm, yay?  It was seriously just clicking a couple buttons, with no actual strategy or interest.   You're bullying a nameless and faceless lever.

7. Eventually one of the parties will have a split and you'll have the ""old"" and ""young"".  They don't really seem to remember how you treated them before.  As I said, everything regresses to the mean.

This game is worth maybe €9.00 for value, as a mobile app, in its current state.  Maybe DLC will fix things, but I'm not sure how, given the design, this could be made more interesting.","Boring.

This is a boring game, which feels like you're pulling 3-4 levers every few minutes to see what happens.  

As background, I like and enjoy complicated strategy games.  Some of my favourites are the Crusader Kings and Europa Universalis series.  I also have sunk many hours into the political and dynasty aspects of The Guild series.  I like these types of games.  I saw a preview and was excited at the idea of a ""mayor simulation"" with some background politics and influencing political parties.  Sounds like a fantastic idea for a game.

This game is none of that.

1.  You'll see a lot of negative reviews with respect to the town planning.  I can appreciate that it is not a city builder.  It wasn't meant to be; however, town councils (county councils), etc have planning offices and engage in town planning.  This is nothing like that.  It's very basic, akin to what you'd find on a mobile phone app.  

You select a district and you can only use % to determine whether it's industry, business or residential. You don't select where the individual neighbourhoods are.  So which ""blocks"" in your district are I B or R, is really up to the game and not you.  This is a weird design choice.  

You put some important buildings, eventually, like police station or courthouse and you can wire it up for gas or sewers, for example, but this is mostly done by just clicking a ""tick"" and hoping the council agrees with you.  It's very basic and not at all enjoyable to watch your city grow, because you've had little to do with it.  This is the opposite experience of the town planning aspect of ""Banished"" for example (which is rather fun to watch the town grow.)

2. You don't create your family.  Yes, this was discussed in the previews so this is only a minor criticism.  Yes, they said it was pre-scripted.  It's worth noting though, that when they say pre-scripted, they mean it.  It has so-called 1000 dynamic events, but none of this really seemed like it couldn't have been done without creating your own family and style.  CK does it.  Anyway, doesn't matter, just poorly thought out in my opinion.

The families you choose are typical tropes.  So you have the villainous and cruel aristrocat party, which of course has ""von"" in the name.  You've some weird stage-irish sounding name and that's the family that's all into working class and unions.  You've the mysterious Russians and then you've a family that's all about science.  How many science dynasties have you read about?  Anyway, it's just trope and as bad as it sounds (the specifics of the families, as in how stereotypical they were actually going to be, was not in the promos.  It's worse than anything you've read.)  I find this to be an immersian killer, your opinion may vary.

3.  The political parties in this fictional town are irritating and seemingly pointless.  Yes, they sit on the spectrum of conservative/liberal and right/left and some mish-mash inbetween.  They have histories that you won't care about.  They are name.  You won't interact with any party leader, for example, as everything is abstract.  

Most of your interactions will be with three buttons.  ""Plead/Demand/Threaten"".  That's it.  You click one and then a dialogue menu comes up.  Once you click one, even if you don't like the dialogue, that's tough.  You have to make a choice of the options, which is 1-2, 1-3, or sometimes 1-4.  What the options do, seems to be an arbitrary mystery.  Sometimes the tooltip popup says, most the time it doesn't.

In any event, it's bizarre.  Let's say a topic of Child Labour arises and one of these parties puts the edict to outlaw child labour before the council.  You will get a pop-up that essentially asks if you will support or oppose this edict.  Let's say you pick oppose.  You then will contact all the political parties, through those 3 aforementioned buttons.  Here's a great example of a lazy design choice...

I'm opposing this.  I want the edict banning child labour to be voted down.  YET all my interactions with the political parties will ask the parties to vote YES.

Ce jeu m'avait semblé intéressant au premier abord. Il nous proposait de suivre le destin d'une dynastie à la tête d'une ville, de l'air industrielle, jusqu'à l'air contemporaine en y ajoutant une dose de gestion politique. En effet, votre personnage est membre d'un parti politique qui doit lui-même se battre contre d'autres partis politiques pour imposer ses idées.

Dans ce jeu donc, les décisions que vous prenez doivent passer par le conseil municipal qui doit décider de vous suivre ou non, en fonction de leur inclinaison politique. Ainsi, un parti de gauche sera plus enclin a accepter un vote pour l'augmentation des impots qu'un parti de droite.

Tout cela se complexifie avec le temps puisque d'autres partis émergent en fonction de l'avancée des époques.
Un arbre technologique est d'ailleurs disponible et vous permet de découvrir de nouvelles inventions et de nouvelles ""lois/décrets"" a mettre en place (sic!). Pas mal, n'est-ce pas? Ouais mais en fait non!

Simuler un système politique est d'une incroyable complexité, tant la politique est plus une affaire d'hommes/femmes avec leurs propres convictions/interactions qu'une histoire de blocs homogènes avec des idées bien arrêtées.
Mais ici, on se retrouve avec un système qui ne fonctionne pas très bien. Pourquoi?

a) la politique est ""linéaire"" dans ce jeu, pour moi qu'est-ce à dire? En réalité, il est assez facile de convaincre un parti politique de changer de bord et de suivre argumentation. Suffit de les pousser un peu et vos réformes passent sans soucis, même auprès des partis historiquement opposés au vôtre. Il n'y a pas de motivation complexe, ça ce limite à : je suis gauche, tu es droite, moi pas voter pour toi bisous.  Pas de personnages qui représenteraient un parti qui auraient chacun leurs motivations et dont on pourraient se jouer. Non, ici, les partis sont des blocs sans visages, des machines a pensées, le système politique théorique à la Hobbes, ou à la Platon. Un ensemble de variables qui influencent si oui ou non, une réforme va passer. Des variables dont vous ne comprenez pas le sens ou la portée . 

b) Aucun sens: je veux augmenter les impôts : je vais voir le parti nationaliste pour qu'il aille dans mon sens, je lui sort (parce qu'il y a des choix de réponses dont je ne suis pas sûr de l'influence sur le résultat final): ""les citoyens veulent cette réforme des impots""...et ça marche, il abonde du coup dans mon sens...j'étais mort de rire. et la suspension d'incrédulité a volé en éclat, je ne pouvais plus prendre le jeu au sérieux.

c) trop lent: la moindre réforme des quartiers demandent un vote. Très réaliste en soi mais si je voulais voir la réalité politique, j'entrerais en politique. La lourdeur du système rend le jeu chiant.

d) aucune concurrence: pas de dynastie concurrente sur la carte qui vous mettrait des baton dans les roues, vous êtes seuls sur la carte.

e) Une campagne risible: une carte, des fonds propres, une série d'objectif a accomplir sur la carte, assez longs et difficiles, c'est tout. C'est pas un mode campagne, c'est un mode libre, revoyez vous définitions les mecs, les objectifs ne sont même pas contraignants, vaque à tes occupations si ça te chante, pas de soucis).

f) 3 scénarios, aucun mode de difficulté.

g) Le choix du personnage n'a quasi aucune influence, vous pouvez en tant que membre d'une famille conservatrice, faire passer des lois progressives, tout le monde s'en cogne. Quel interet de choisir alors? Certes, les personnages ont chacun un petit bonus de ci de là qui leur sont propre, mais rien de majeur.

h) C'est moche et la musique est une insulte aux oreilles, en esperant que le thème change lorsqu'on change d'ère technologique, sinon il y aurait en tout et pour tout, un thème musical pas très long qui plus est.

i) Le jeu n'explique pas ses différentes variables (soins, éducations, sécurité, environnement, loisirs...) quelles sont les influences de chacune sur votre quartier/ville? Qui s'en soucie?

Ce jeu ne conviendra ni aux gens qui aiment le city bulding car le vote est trop contraignant et le jeu n'offre aucune possibilité créative a ce niveau. MAis il ne conviendra pas non plus aux gens qui aiment mettre en place des stratégies, tactiques et complot tant le système politique est nébuleux et au final simpliste (pas de concurrence, pas de motivation personnelle, pas de révolte du citoyen même si on passe les impôts de 10 à 25 % d'un coup). Puis, ça se prend trop au serieux, si au moins le jeu avait pris le parti (lol) de l'humour, j'aurais bien plus accepté ses défauts mais non. J'ai juste envie de rejouer à Tropico, qui même si il a beaucoup de défauts, prend le virage de l'humour et ça lui réussi pas mal.

Le seul avantage que je vois au jeu? Une bonne entrée pédagogique pour expliquer à des élèves l'échiquier politique, les différents courants de pensées et la gestion des lois et des décrets. Une bonne activité d'introduction à un cours d'introduction à la science politique en somme. mais a 44 €, j'ai mieux fait d'acheter des manuels.",

首先，游戏的玩法是作为市长来宏观把控一个城市的发展
这就意味着我再也不用像海岛大亨一样兼职建筑设计师，道路规划师，企业老板，农场主等等
和一般的城市模拟相比少了更多具体建造上的细节，但却多了许多政治方面的内容
简单点来说就是从战术到战略的区别
更让玩家能够模拟城市决策层的日常事务
对城市的规划，重要设施的建立，党派的平衡，选票的争夺，突发事件的取舍。

1.第三时代，快3000居民，我现在开四倍速已经感觉到卡顿，可能是我的配置有些不够（GTX970+E3+8G),不过我还是希望卡发人员能尽量优化一下。
2.视角似乎有些局限，不能观赏像海岛大亨一样拉近或拉平欣赏风景还有截图（明明海面做的不错的）
3.中文首发+语音好评，第一次看到客服回复，而且还是中文的，为客服点个赞。
4.界面有些粗糙，感觉有点像页游，优化一下体验或许会好一些。
5.不知道有没有战争的设定，看评论似乎没有，现在还没玩通，暂不表观点。
6.个别对选项，名词的解释似乎不是很清晰甚至没有，不知是BUG还是翻译失误。
7.不知道有没有像海岛大亨一样的战役，任务系统，这样代入感会强一些，暂时是没有发现。

After further playing the game through more families and on all 3, yes 3, maps. I can't say this is a decent buy anymore, especially since i can't get my money back. The designs become extremely repetative once you've done a single playthrough that it just feels like slugging through a routine instead of planning ahead for mistakes or getting tripped by a new event or party. At first i felt that the party interaction was fine enough, but again, after a first playthrough, it feels so cheap. All the parties interact the same way and you have near limitless supply of forcing them to do what you want as there are almost no consequences to your actions unless you have somehow made the city broke. For a mayor simulator/city builder, this game capture nothing good of either side. The politics are too weak and simple to call a political simulator and the city building is checking boxes and placing districts and special buildings wherever you want. No in depth design or challenges or personalization that would actually make it a good city builder.
If you thought this would be a more political Tropico, don't buy it, If you thought this would be a decent city builder, don't buy it, if you thought this would be an over priced mobile game that requires basic thought and simple skillsets of reading numbers and are ok with that, the wait till it goes on sale or get a fremium game on your phone first

Original~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A good game in theory. It has all the pieces and ideas and expansive nature of a new and innovative city builder. Problem is that the late game gets easier and easier as the main challenge of the game comes down to whether you can get your council to approve new districts and expansions rather than actual policies or challenges to your rule.
The different starting points are all unique and the families have actual stories, again all great ideas, just not fully capitalized on. All the family decisions are one shot 3 part choices that have little effect on the actual story. You will next to always have a kid, your family will continue whether you have a child or not. Your choices and dilemmas will always be the same no matter your actual actions. Trying to be a liberal elite? No problem, no changes needed. Trying to be a conservative researcher. No problem, just be a cruel trait asshole.
Honestly i love the style and progression of the game the best. It holds up well to other city builders, but falls far short of other titles' charm such as Tropico or SimCity. A great way to pass time and test your patience and knowledge of politics, but I would tell anyone interested to wait till it goes on sale as they hid most of the late game for a solid reason, they didn't flesh it out well","Edit:
After further playing the game through more families and on all 3, yes 3, maps. I can't say this is a decent buy anymore, especially since i can't get my money back. The designs become extremely repetative once you've done a single playthrough that it just feels like slugging through a routine instead of planning ahead for mistakes or getting tripped by a new event or party. At first i felt that the party interaction was fine enough, but again, after a first playthrough, it feels so cheap. All the parties interact the same way and you have near limitless supply of forcing them to do what you want as there are almost no consequences to your actions unless you have somehow made the city broke.

Even if you put in a few public buildings, the budget is almost negative, so you have to keep building new districts or raising taxes.

For anyone looking for their next city-building fix, this isn't it. It's very much more of a political simulator in the vein of Democracy or Fate of the World. However, I'm not sure that works entirely well with the city building aspects as they don't give you the flexibility to make the kind of decisions you'd like to make. For example, you build (or rather, seek permission to build) service buildings like schools and clinics which have an effective radius. But you can't choose specifically which blocks are residential, commercial etc, only the proportion spread within a neighbourhead, which means you end up placing services in less than optimal positions.

The evolution of the city through the ages is a nice touch, as it the way the politics changes with the times. Unfortunately, it basically plays out exactly the same way with each playthrough, and other than a few shorter, limited, scenarios you ultimately have to play the same Swarelia story. I guess this will be supported with future DLC but at £35 already this is a bit of a rip-off, especially without a simple sandbox mode.

The game also has a few bugs; and the economic model doesn't entirely make much sense. You'll be spending a lot of time just waiting for things to happen...

2. 游戏内容空洞，相较于天际线、模拟城市这些传统城市建造类游戏来说，这款游戏较为新颖的加入了许多动态事件，需要玩家在几个选项中进行选择，以及一个恶心的皿煮议会，玩家需要和众多政党撕逼。但是却失去了城市建造类游戏最原本的乐趣，即规划设计城市本身。
3. 操作界面极为不合理，我玩了6小时，并没有发现一个能快速升级城内所有区域的设施的方法，每当研发了新科技，我得挨个在每个区域进行改造，而且还得一步步在那个界面里面点下去。

    而且行政区发展到水、电和通信的需求后的代价太大，很难负担得起，科技树这方面做成线性或者有时代限制会比较好一些。这三样关键性的发展早了或者晚了都是很伤的！比如到1860年，我的水管都不一定能全铺好，因为预算不够。然而一旦有了相应的科技，工厂就必须要这些东西了，否则分分钟破产。。
    有点不能理解的是城市太脆弱了，特别容易赤字，所以提升市民满意度的建筑还不能造多了，我到了1865年都不敢造剧院的，只能靠随机事件来提升娱乐值，更别提禁止xx了233
    更不能理解新手教程里面让你很早就造火车站的意图，2000w很难赞的，开个新区一下就耗完了！
    本作作为卖点的议会制度，我现在看来还是有点鸡肋的，正确的事情基本上都能通过，除非刻意把关系变糟。不同意的话随便唬唬也能给通过。。多少像是走流程，可能到第四第五时代有那种不分青红皂白的捣乱的。总的来说自由度太小，现阶段更像是EA，甚至还没有模拟经营最重要的随机地图模式！游戏方面希望能减少上手难度，前期的发展更有点死板了，否则很容易赤字。建议没买的还是多观望！","After a few initial attempts, I felt the difficulty was quite high. I stopped at the third generation the first time. Furthermore, the tutorial isn't comprehensive, requiring me to experiment to figure out many things. I'd appreciate a more detailed explanation of the various attributes. For example, I'm not sure if the so-called satisfaction buffs for each class function the same way as amenity in Civilization.

Also, the cost of developing administrative districts to meet the needs for water, electricity, and communications is prohibitive. A linear or time-bound technology tree would be better. Developing these three key areas too early or too late is disastrous! For example, by 1860, I might not have fully installed my water pipes because my budget was insufficient. However, once the necessary technologies are acquired, factories will need them, otherwise they'll go bankrupt in a matter of seconds.
What's a bit puzzling is that cities are so fragile and prone to deficits, so you can't build too many buildings to boost citizen satisfaction. I didn't even dare build a theater in 1865, relying on random events to boost my entertainment, not to mention banning xx.

I also can't understand why the tutorial lets you build a train station so early on. 20 million is hardly impressive, and it's all gone in a flash just opening a new district!

The parliamentary system, a key selling point for this game, seems a bit useless now. Correct decisions are generally passed unless you deliberately try to sour relations. Disagreements can be passed with a bit of bluffing. It's more like a routine, and maybe by the fourth or fifth era, there'll be some indiscriminate disruption. Overall, the level of freedom is too limited, and at this stage it feels more like EA. It doesn't even have the crucial random map mode that's crucial for business simulations! I hope to ease the learning curve. The early stages are a bit rigid, otherwise it's easy to run into deficits. I suggest waiting and watching for those who haven't bought it yet!"

但是也有几点不足，看很多人说画面的问题，这个倒是没有太多的感觉，毕竟策略类的游戏不太看重这些。
1.对于金钱只能用为数不多的工厂和80%的个人税收来平衡，实在是很可怕的问题，而且，80%的税收市民真的不会造反吗？还有，比如电厂这个设施，从建造起来就开始不断地亏钱，在升级了之后，可以卖出多余的电，然而还是入不敷出的。
2.在游戏中点击回到主菜单会有一定几率切换至全英文，必须重进才行，这应该是个BUG。
3.在升级科技树的时候，往往从第三个时代开始科技就跟不上时代了，往往一个时代过去了还是有三分之一的科技没有完成，不知道是不是设计者有意设定的难度。
4.很多的数据不够透明，比如基础的六项数值，只有数值显示，但是没有具体的细节加成，比如某项政策或者某个建筑提供了多少，很多时候让人摸不清头脑。还有就是金钱的流入和流出，只有最后的总和，很难控制好财政。

1.城市的收入成长大部分是靠税收提高的，时代一直在进步，但是发展好想没多少哦，不提高税收就很难提升收入，感觉很蠢。
2.尴尬的拖动，为什么不是鼠标在边界的时候移动画面，而一定要按着键拖，好不方便，还不如WASD好用
3.视野范围，很多很多的服务项目大小超过了屏幕。看着很难受，应该可以再拖远一点可以直接看到城市全貌
4.服务设施设置的繁琐，看了哪个指标比较少，我必须得点进区域改造点点点进服务设施才能看有哪些已经放了，放在哪里，如果这个城市已经有了还要点退出确定，再点别的区域再点进去才行，希望可以有点屏幕上面的指标，比如点了健康值就会显示城市里所有的提供健康值的设施
5.党派之类的设置很有意思，但是过于难了吧。我们的市长至少有一个自己的党派吧，家族传承当市长，但是还要讨好这个那个，几百年都没有自己的后援么。。。还是只有我玩的工人阶级是这样？？
6.我一直没找到扩张区域在哪里。有没有啊。。没有的话可以加么，有时候区域边界刚好多出一小块很难受
7.时代更迭过于突然了吧，人民需求应该在一段时间内缓慢提升，一下子来有些吃不消哦
8.科技树完美点好很难而且感觉点好科技树的提升比较小

29393332,schinese,2017.00.21 13:19,❌,✅,0.7919625044,61,"说实话，一开始我对这款游戏非常期待。
我以前也试过比如模拟城市、行会、海岛大亨一类的。
但是个人感觉对选择合适的位置放建筑，每一个建筑都要自己来这种模式没有兴趣。
而且我这样有一点强迫症的人来说，管理建筑是一件很麻烦的事情，放这里有点不好看——难受、这个地方没有充分利用空间——难受，放这里用处好像不如放那里用处大——难受，没有多久就会感到很不愉快，在加上价格不低，于是没有买。
但是我在游戏发行前一两个星期在其他网站看见了这款游戏，它宣传的是从宏观层面管理城市，说什么做一个城市的管理者而非建造者。
也就是说我最讨厌的建筑问题消失了，反而增加了我比较感兴趣的管理要素，并且据说还有政治、科研以及各种随机事件。
在发行一天前我看了一位玩家的试玩视频，大约40分钟的视频中演示了游戏中第一时代的游玩过程，的确实现了宣传中的各种要素，使得我决定预购这款游戏。
可是让我没有想到的是，其实游戏的内容我已经在那40分钟的视频中基本体验完了。
说实话游戏的体验其实是不错的，但只是对于刚开始的一个到两个小时来说。游戏的城市管理系统和投票系统以及科研系统再配合随机事件给了我新鲜的感觉。
不过当你游玩都三个小时或者之后，你就会发现其实游戏的各种系统千篇一律，你现在所做的事情与游戏刚开始时的事并没有什么改变，操作充满机械性，不断的就是花钱——没钱——等钱——花钱这样的模式。
而且花的钱都是一样的花法，每个行政区的建设基本没有区别，唯一的变化就是你的服务建筑的位置，然而这唯一的变化只花了你一丢丢的时间就能搞定，其余剩下的都是流水线般的过程。
所谓的科研与法案也没有根本上的区分，只是用来调整相同的数据的一个小工具。
然后所谓的大量随机事件由于其的高发性，到后面你会发现1000个随机事件并没有多少，一场游戏下来没有遇到重复的是不可能的。
而且这种事件的一部分发生很有规律性，根本就不动态也不随机，你玩到什么程度基本就必定触发什么事件。
然而这些就是游戏的全部。
哦，你说政治？抱歉，那是只要你求求和你关系好的，要求和你关系一般的，威胁啥和你关系不好的党派全家就能够搞定的东西。
除了花掉你很多无谓的时间看选项，其实没有什么用。
当然如果你玩到了后期，就会有一堆党派，你会需要考虑到他们的各种关系，但是基本上也就那样，推推拉拉依旧挺轻易的搞定，反而要花掉更多时间。
假如你对政治不是那么的喜爱，进行到这已经会让人不悦，游戏性大大不足。

在游戏进行到第二世代的中期的时候，我已经开始对这款游戏失去了新鲜感，同时也失去了兴趣。但是由于对之后第二次工业革命带来的变化的期待，我依旧在继续。
可是当我进入第三时代后，发现即便更换了时代，游戏依旧是一样的，没有发生什么变化，依旧纠结于我之前说的那些东西，于是我决定不再等待，直接退出游戏。
客观地来说：
画面：
即便开到了最高画质，各种地形和城镇建筑依旧比较模糊，缩小的时候看还勉强，一旦放大就...... 但是个人感觉城市做的还有一些时代气息，各种小元素运用得不错，作为一个经营类的游戏，画面已经能够使我满意了。
游戏性：
我相信你在刚开始的第一个小时内会感到很兴奋，第二个小时内依旧有趣，第三个小时你就会感到无聊，之后就是枯燥和机械化。

不过这款游戏做了官方中文，我对开发商还是有好感的，喜欢政治谈判和休闲建筑的人是可以入手，但是最好打折之后再说，个人认为70已经是这个游戏现有内容我愿意出的最高的价钱了。
个人来说，这款游戏并不能让我满意，它的价钱与是内容和简介不太相符，可惜我已经玩四个小时了，我会尝试申请退款，虽然机会很渺茫就是了。

The later stages are filled with too many political parties, and it's so troublesome. Even raising taxes takes a lot of points. The citizen benefits aren't necessarily that high, but taxes keep rising. Everything has to be voted on in Parliament. Twice, even with a clear majority in favor, it failed by a single vote. It's absolutely awful. It's amazing how good a one-party system is. You can fix anything you want. The Communist Party in the game unanimously opposed the ban on pornographic comics. Haha, I'm so confused.

The downside is that the core of the game is battling Parliament. The modes are too narrow, and there are very few maps. The background music is too monotonous, and the lighting and shadow effects, even at the highest setting, are still mediocre. The building models haven't changed in three eras... I didn't notice any difference in the pre-release architectural styles. There were also relatively few random events, often repetitive. However, the character portraits and family crests were quite good. The controls weren't very simple, with no shortcuts needed. There were also many confusing stats with no explanation. After entering the campaign, returning to the main menu would return to English, but restarting would fix it. You can really enjoy wrangling with the council for a long time, but I wouldn't recommend it if you don't have the patience. Based on the current content, it's not worth the money. Stay tuned!"

You really have to give it a chance, though. The first half-dozen playthroughs, it can feel like it is just unbelievably hard. Then I realized that I didn't need to wait for the game to tell me to add another district. Once your first district fills up, make sure your cashflow is positive, and build another district. That will set you back in the short-term, but then you'll get into a rhythm of building new districts, adding services, waiting until they fill up with industry/commercial buildings - and then rinse, and repeat.

The real meat comes in the way that you choose to develop the tech, and add services or stockpile wealth. Will you try to up your salary early, so that you can bypass votes and build freely? Will you let the council do what they will, and save your points for a rainy day?

I did, and that's where I really started having fun with it. It sort of feels like you're ""winning"" if your city has electricity before the 1800's are out. I unlocked contraception and womens' right to choose around 1860 in one game, and it felt like I had created a cultural Mecca out of nothing.

Of course, I blew it in the next era by adding services more quickly than I was sourcing revenue or adding new districts, and had to start over. But now, I enjoy every restart, because I have new ideas for how to develop my city. This time, electric early and straight to assembly line. Oh, but I added electric lights in my first district too early, and now we're broke? And I spent all of my political capital getting here, and two of the parties are pissed at me?

This game is great in concept, and very very poor in implementation. I have played to completion a few times, and can say this:
1)	LLAAAAAGGGGGG - Regardless of others saying ""it plays fine"", if you are a successful mayor and get 10-15k population by around Era 3, the game will CRAWL. I have SSDs, 32GB RAM, and a 6 core CPU with HT. And it is literally single FPS by the time you hit Era 5. There is no way they didnt notice this in development, and yet they threw it out there anyways. Unacceptable.
2)	This appears to be based on some designers idea of how politics work. Choices you make may or may not do what you think they do, and there is no information denoting what the overall effect might be. I don’t need the game to let me min/max, but I would like to at least understand who supports various initiatives, and what they are likely to vote for. It feels like there is some formula, but it is very unclear what that is. This makes every decision very frustrating.
3)	When information is presented, it is done in an awkward and confusing manner. For example there are lots of stats about each district available, but none of them cover “what does this district need?” or “How do I address problem X?” So even when there is info available, it is still frustrating just trying to make sense of it.
4)	The engine designer must have done the UI also because the way things like bonuses are presented is horrible. “Sales Bonus! Demand -10%!”. Even if the engine calculated a bonus as -10% for something, why in the world would you present it like that. Its just backwards.
5)	Citizen desires, which they call The Wheel of Life are presented as offsets to the current era target. So you have a hard time understanding how much better you need to make things. They should just show it as “11/15” instead of “-4”. Even then, once you learn to understand what it means, how to solve that issue is unclear.
6)	Nothing has any consequence. It doesnt matter what youve done or how you treat the parties. Vote for the most liberal policy available, have money in the bank and the coucil will love you.
7)	Citizens dont care if its the modern era and they have no utilities and dirt roads. It makes no difference whatsoever. You can buy off the vote and people still drive around on dirt roads. If the game lets you see details, you could see people checking stuff out on their ipads while walking along next to the cow droppings. Luckily the game doesnt let you zoom in ( or out ) enough to notice.
As I said, this game could be really good and after playing it a few times I can see where they were going with it. But the developer just did a very bad job of putting it into action in a way that makes sense to most people. Sure you can learn how to read their numbers, but I should have to work at learning the strategy, NOT at figuring out how to read their statistics. 
This is a $10 game with more polish than you would expect from that price range and a big publisher. For $40 its early access at BEST, and honestly, Im very skeptical of how deep the game would be even if it didnt have the litany of bugs. There are literally mobile games with more complexity, and better UIs!","TL;DR Dont waste your money hoping that they fix it eventually or have the balls to sell you a DLC that implements what should have been in the core game

总而言之这100多块钱可能并不值得购买现在的这个版本的Urban Empire。","I excitedly started playing this game early this morning. I spent about six hours, making it through the fourth generation with some rough patches. The game feels like a decade old game, with both the graphics and the UI brimming with browser-based game flair.

Putting that aside for now, the game itself has its fair share of issues. The single source of money doesn't seem to balance expenditures with income. The combined costs of getting electricity, water, gas, and transportation to a city are over 100,000, but how much can a city collect in taxes, not to mention hospitals, police stations, and so on? By the end, it felt like Don't Starve, with a perpetually negative balance. If it were Tropico, you could adjust taxes to get by, but here, you still have something called a parliament to thwart your efforts. The idea is good, but the balance, gameplay, and optimization aren't what you'd expect from a 2017 game. Of course, there's room for improvement. I hope to incorporate islands and other SimCity-style games to increase income, and perhaps the gaming experience will be better. The game itself is 5/10.
Music is 8/10.
Graphics is 2/10.
I hope the developers can learn from others' strengths and make this game even better.
All in all, the current version of Urban Empire probably isn't worth the extra 100 bucks."

So in city building games you have money, build house (plots), production builds, security, etc and collect taxes and trade to make money back. This game is definitely not that.

In current city management games (like Cities Skylines or Sim City) you have money, place zones and the game simulates citizens filling those plots, which you then collect taxes from. This income is then used to pay for services. These often have more tax options and possibly zoning options but it is still very much what you do. This game isn't that.

In this game it tries to portray eal city management. You can't just place plots or build structures, there is a city council that has to weigh the benefits of an option. If you want to expand the city, you need to design a zone, then propose that to the city council. A political party or more may oppose this, but you can appeal to them. However if you have bad finances don't expect the vote to pass. Almost every action goes to a vote.

The game is set in a pseudo-realistic time, and as time passes new technologies are invented (game explains that technologies that you unlock are from you importing them to the city). The newspaper that pops up includes references to things that happened in that year in the real world.

This is a slow game, and you end up having to struggle to balance the budget. The politics can also get quite intriguing. So be prepared, if you don't like slow games with lots of reading then stay away.

29391140,german,2017.00.21 10:29,✅,✅,0.4519292712,1,"Hallo erstmal,

In der Regel erstelle ich keine Reviews, selbst bei Spielen, die ich extrem gerne zocke. Der Hintergrund hierbei ist, dass diese in der Regel sowieso mit Reviews geflutet werden. 
Bei diesem Spiel, welches ich mal als Randerscheinung betiteln würde, dachte ich mir jedoch, mache ich es dieses mal, da es wie gesagt, kein Mainstream Titel ist.

Kurze Zusammenfassung worum es geht:
Man startet in einem von mehreren (Bürgermeister) Häusern und versucht seine Stadt und sich selbst erfolgreich zu halten. Hierbei muss man sich A eine Stadt aufbauen und B diese entsprechend gestalten und wirtschaftlich, sozial (und einige andere Werte mehr) florierend halten. 
Die Krux hierbei ist, dass es nicht wie bei ""normalen"" Citybuildern eine Alleinige Entscheidung ist, sondern dass man sich mit den aktiven Parteien einigen muss. Dies kann dann durchaus mal zu absurden Situationen führen. 
Hinzu kommen noch ein Tech-Tree, Spionage, Partnerstädte und Bürgermeisterwahlen, ab der 3. Periode. Und ja, die Bürgermeisterwahlen sind nicht immer einfach, vor allem, wenn es der Stadt nicht gerade (finanziell) gut geht.

Grafik:
+ Für das Genre, eigentlich schon fast zu gut. Es ist wirklich hübsch anzusehen, auch wenn diese Effekte in der Regel nicht den Status der Stadt anzeigen (Beispiel Verkehr, dieser ist schlicht zur Verschönerung)
+ Die Menüs sind ebenfalls hübsch gemacht
- Einige Grafik Effekte sehen nicht schön aus (Fahrzeuge, welche durch sich selber fahren, Sonnen Auf und Untergänge, die teilweise sehr unschön wirken)

Story:
+ Nun ja, Sie ist ok und durchdacht. Nichts überwältigendes, aber jede Familie hat seine eigene Geschichte, mit eigenen Problemen und Bonis. 
- Ein kleines Minus: Ich hätte mir hier auch gerne mehr Möglichkeiten gewünscht, die Grundstory zu verändern und nicht nur einzelne Skills. So ist es rein Storytechnisch nicht wiederspielenswert.

Funktionen: 
Ich zähle jetzt nur die Main Funktionen auf.
+ Städtebau bzw. Stadtteilbau.
+ Abstimmungsverfahren. (Teilweise nicht nachvollziehbar, hier würde man sich teilweise etwas mehr Input wünschen) 
# Familiendynastie. Naja, wegen mir hätte es die Funktion nicht geben müssen, siehe auch Kritik in der Zusammenfassung. Ich sehe hier beim ersten mal Spielen der Parteien evtl. etwas ""Spannung"", danach ist es eigentlich recht egal bis hin zu leicht nervig.
+ Skillbaum. Der Begriff ist falsch, aber ich bin mir nicht sicher, wie ich es umschreiben soll. Während des Spiels wird man vor Entscheidungen gesetzt, die je nachdem zu einer Steigerung oder Senkung eines Skills beitragen können. / Zum Beispiel ""Sanf""t / ""Grausam"" usw..
+ Statistiken ohne Ende, bei solch einem Spiel sicherlich notwendig. Diese sind eigentlich hübsch aufbereitet und gut zu lesen.

Negativ: 
- Zum aktuellen Zeitpunkt ist es so, dass noch einige Übersetzungen und Tooltips in der deutschen Übersetzung fehlen, diese werden hoffentlich mit dem nächsten Update nachgereicht. 
- Einiges wirkt seltsam. Beispiel: Episode 2, bin ich irgendwann soweit dass ich 2 reine Gewerbegebiete habe und es wird immer noch nach mehr verlangt, während 2 reine Industrie auf Minus Zahlen stehen. Dabei hatte ich wie bereits geschrieben, 2 reine Gewerbegebiete und 2 Mischbezirke mit Bewohnern und Gewerbe. 
Es war somit eine totale Gewerbeübermacht gegeben und dies sollte ich laut Spiel weiter ausbauen. Der Rest stand weiterhin auf Minuszahlen. Dies war auch nicht nur 2 oder 3 Runden, dies war dann fast 15 Jahre so.

Fazit:
Vieles sehr gut gemacht, eine hochinteressante Idee und ein bisschen Klimbim, den ich (persönlich) nicht gebraucht hätte. 
Ein paar Bugs im Bereich Balancing sind am Tag 1 auf jeden Fall verschmerzbar, ebenso die kleineren Bugs, welche noch nachgepatcht werden können und hoffentlich auch werden.

Wer somit sich gerne mal in der Politik versuchen möchte, mit dem Anhängsel eine Stadt zu bauen, der kann hier getrost zugreifen!",

修正完目前存在的各种bug，应勉强可以打个7分。

游戏性缺失的前提下，后续需要大量DLC来填补。
如果没有大量DLC填补，作为成品游戏基本坑了。

2017/3/2

把之前的不推荐购买修改了一下，感觉不知道是不是制作方修改了一些数据还是什么，大方面没什么变更，应该要等大更新或者DLC，不过小方面，感觉改了不少。
+议会感觉没那么无厘头了，不会集体反对，也不会疯狂加税了？
+好像把设施的费用降低了些？不会像以前建几个惠民建筑就崩了
+一些超前于时代的事件现在不会提前发生了
+统计栏的统计数据好像没那么凌乱了。以前的数据一大堆看花眼，现在感觉比较清晰些了？


很多方面都是“感觉”和“好像”，因为更新记录了，游戏方也没说到底有没有更新这个方面，不过比起我预购那天玩的那天，整个游戏感觉好些了，不会是“很糟糕”，现在是处于“有点意思”的阶段。
因此特意把评价修改一下吧，虽说是推荐购买，不过还是建议打折或是大更之后买吧。现在的所处的阶段仅仅是“有点意思”。",

经济上，无视任何需求，坚持两百年亏损不动摇！
政治上，能抱君能监控能手段能连任，怎样都行！
这游戏还是挺有意思的，把政治诉求、经济发展、民生需求很好地做了关联：如何在档派、正府、民众之间取得平衡。（(⊙﹏⊙)b）。另外，民生满足太快有风险，需求也会大涨，又提一堆需求（拖经济），经济却跟不上，所以发展要适当。
刚上市，还是有不少bug的，例如我新建了一个行政区域，连续几年都没有居民，没有任何经济活动，但是就是无法在议会通过撤区的决议，原因居然是有居民……例如居民需求和加成需求的图标显示都是一样，每次都要点击看看是啥才能看清是什么效果，造建筑也没有适配土地提醒，这类小瑕疵还是有待优化的。
---------------------------------
重开6小时，刚入第三时代1920，全城月盈利200K左右（最早的3个区占了180K……）。
根据第一盘的心得，这一盘做了一些调整：
1）不开基础设施（至少目前到1920还没有开过除了默认的【道路1】之外的其他）
2）速开区，盈利能够支撑新区了，就一定开新区，目前整块地图我已经有了17个区，14个区已经盈利，可用行政区块目测只剩下最后两块
3）合理划分行政区域，新建区前看看左上角的住宅区、商业区、工业区需求，分配比例，例如住房少了，新区肯定要多分些住房区，至于科学的比例，目前还没有挖掘到，我一般是保证住房区》商业区+工业区（需求最大差异不超3）
4）控制每区块的大小，为了更好利用工业商业区和公共服务设施的【最佳距离】，而且相邻行政区可以利用服务buff，本局一般按照5X5或者4X6的高密度形式来进行建设
5）控制每个区的盈利，目前除了不开基础设施，还限制了每个区不会超过1个公共服务设施或者城市机构（法院、电厂类似这些加全城buff的建筑物）
6）幸福指数方面，多利用通过法案来提升，很多法案不需要月费即可有加成，相当划算。税收一直控制在13%，因为经济发展比较顺利，也没有提升的政治诉求
7）议会方面，提案前就能看到投票数就很简单了，这一盘除了某个医疗类的法案，其他的议会都帮我通过，没有用过任何手段
8）城市机构，电厂（优先建造）、码头（优先升级）的全城加成还是相当不错的，而且除了码头和火车站其他都没有位置要求和地形限制，存够钱就升级吧。但是第三时代前如果你行政区不多，就不先建了
9）公共服务设施，加成主要靠距离（圆形的加成圈），所以建筑的位置相当重要",

就感觉游戏性主要在于投票，城市的发展方面太过于依赖于议会，玩家要做的的就是根据城市面板需求与经济收入安排新的设施，然后让议会通过，就感觉游戏城市规划方面既不像模拟城市、天际线那样有着很强的自由度，政治方面又只局限于议会的投票。

此外还会出现很多的随机事件。

不过开发组的态度还是比较诚恳的，专门安排了中文客服，一直再听取评测区的意见，所以我暂时不会退款。但是我希望能看到制作组在游戏性上能有更大的改进，毕竟这款游戏的机制还是很新颖的，把城市模拟与政治模拟结合起来，所以还有很多地方可以改进。

上来有四个家族可以选，作为历史的见证我毫不犹豫选择了工人阶级，毕竟咱们工人有力量，开局还是比较顺利的，游戏的新手教程也比较详细，但不够完善。它并没有警示到不要XJB创建一个新的行政区及其规划问题，一旦你协调不好就会出现亏损五六百万的局面，别问我怎么知道的。另外发展速度比较适中，感觉到最后大概需要小半天时间，让我想起了文明系列，但这两款是完全不同的游戏，后期可以研制军火等等以后大概会有战争场景吧，适合消磨时间。
比较有趣的一点就是世袭制（儿孙继承法），首先你必定会有一个儿子（什么鬼）然后在他成长过程中也就是你担任市长过程中会对他的人生做出一些选择，这些选择会影响儿子的性格，游戏共分为五个时代，每个时代都会换一个市长，也就是你的儿子，孙子 blablablablabla。

游戏本身还是具有一定难度的
1.后期越来越多的政党
2.众多的基础设施及其高额的维护费用
3.有时候谜之赤字然后崩盘
4.随着时代更迭研究方向越来越多

但是难度下本身还是具有很多乐趣的，就像简介一样事件真的是非常非常多，大到城市规划，小到柴米油盐，内涵还是比较丰富的。不同的家族事件不一样，比如工人阶级就会指责出身，而贵族就没有这种事件，可玩性比较高，不同的场景发展也不一样。

没有入手的盆友们可以考虑入手，游戏刚出，感觉可扩展的内容和可优化的地方还是比较多的，期待作者的更新。

","I've been playing for a while now, and overall, it's a well-crafted game with every detail. In my opinion, the core gameplay is the laws, and the most important ones that change the game's trajectory are the laws. Taxes have the biggest impact on your economy, but if you mindlessly raise taxes in the later stages out of economic pressure, you've already lost.

You have four families to choose from at the start. As a witness to history, I chose the working class without hesitation. After all, we workers are powerful. The game starts off relatively smoothly, and the tutorial is detailed, though not comprehensive. It doesn't warn against the rash creation of new administrative districts and the planning issues involved; if you don't coordinate well, you'll end up losing five or six million. Don't ask me how I know that. The development speed is also quite moderate; it feels like it takes about half a day to complete the final game. It reminds me of the Civilization series, but the two are completely different games. Later on, you can research munitions and other things, and there will probably be war scenes. It's a good way to kill time.
A particularly interesting aspect is the hereditary system (son-grandson succession). First, you'll inevitably have a son (what the heck?). As he grows up, you'll make choices about his life, which will influence his personality. The game is divided into five eras, each with a new mayor: your son, grandson, etc.

The game itself is quite challenging.
1. More and more political parties appear in the later stages.
2. Extensive infrastructure and high maintenance costs.
3. Sometimes mysterious deficits and collapses occur.
4. With each era, there are more and more research directions.

But the difficulty is still quite enjoyable. As the introduction suggests, there are a ton of events, from big-picture city planning to the everyday life of everyday life. The content is quite rich. Different families have different events. For example, the working class will criticize their origins, while the nobles don't. The game is quite replayable, and different scenarios unfold differently.

Those who haven't bought it yet should consider it. The game is new, and I feel like there's still a lot of room for expansion and optimization. I look forward to the author's updates.

Enough talk, I'm off to solve the 5 million dollar crisis (life is hopeless)

如果非要拿一个游戏来选择对比，我会选择该发行商的另外一个游戏《海岛大亨》，同样作为带有政治色彩的模拟建造游戏，海岛大亨在模拟经营和建造布局方面要强很多。还有比较规范的产业链和贸易。建造布局方面也是非常的自由。也很大程度上满足了布局拍照党的需求。而且在公众设施以及利民法案上面，反对派和叛军也不会在这些点上面找茬。当然，在略带诙谐的政治上要比这款游戏弱很多。因为很多事在讲不来的时候可以用军队摆平。
这款游戏我玩的时间并不长，也不敢妄下言论，在上手方面就让我感觉到了许多不适，在玩过了那么多模拟建造城市的游戏，会发现，哪怕类型不同，方向不同，但起码上手和熟悉的程度上相差并不多，而这款游戏在建造上简陋也就算了，在布局上面，有些时候会非常烦躁，美观程度非常差，因为只能采用了拖动区域的方式，而无法进行划线，然而也就算了，在对齐上面还逼死一群强迫症患者；在放置以及拆除和搬迁上面你都会遇到困难，因为很多时候你永远也摆脱不了的一个问题，就是投票。
游戏推出没多久，时不时会遇到一些问题，比如在主菜单上面卡壳，还有从游戏退回主菜单后会出现字体从中文变成英文，研究界面的字体会出现方块，希望能修正。
总体来说，游戏并不如意。给推荐是对模拟游戏的支持，和出了简体中文。希望开发者在建造的自由度和政治上面的死板上做些调整。精神上表示支持。",

29389632,schinese,2017.00.21 08:25,✅,❌,0.5,2,"这游戏我关注很久了，刚出来我就加了愿望单，后来直接预购的。玩了3小时，来说说感想。
首先，别人说的优化问题，退出主菜单变英文问题，等等各种bug我都没有遇到。我的电脑配置也不算高，才960 2G，画面可以调非常高，可能放大的话有些细节不是很好，不过整体画面还是挺好的。毕竟我觉得模拟类游戏玩的不是他的画质（全像素我都玩的下去）。
作为一个模拟类游戏爱好者，我也玩过很多其他同类游戏，不过这款游戏和普通的模拟类游戏有很大区别，因为你作为的是游戏里的决策者，而不是建造者。你的每一个操作都是通过决策来实现的，你唯一能决定的可能只有建在哪了，所以建造类爱好者可以不用买了。每一个决策都要通过议会投票，这游戏的创新性就在于这里，所以这游戏更加讲究技巧，不是我有钱就可以造什么，有的人抱怨钱比较难赚，没钱议会就不听你的。其实我的诀窍就是慢慢来，当你没有资本的时候就慢慢累积资本，所以玩这个游戏需要有点耐心，不要妄想每个决策都通过，其实有的决策意义不大，你可以先同意下来让它顺其自然，不通过也不会对你造成损失。而议会系统的天平只要偏向同意那边就意味着最后投票结果就是通过了，不用再在这个决策上花费心思了。对于想要通过的决策，三种沟通方式都可以适当使用，反正好感度减少了，过一阵子你不对他们提什么要求也会回来的。经济发展后，提高税收通过率会大幅度提高的，所以一定要记得多多提高税收，这样才不容易出现财政赤字。
可能由于是战役的原因，重复度确实比较高，比如有些事件都是肯定会发生的，多玩几次同一战役的话都能知道下一个是什么事件，会缺少一些新意。强烈建议开发商加入沙盒模式，这样重玩性比较高
游戏毒性一般，主要是比较有难度，不算很休闲，不过我还是很喜欢的。游戏全中文，翻译程度比较高，好评！
毕竟这才第一天发行，后面还有很多时间修改加入更多元素，我还是比较看好这款游戏的（这种游戏不加个十几个DLC，怎么能算完整体！）","I've been eyeing this game for a long time. I added it to my wishlist right after it came out and then pre-ordered it. I've played it for three hours, so here's my thoughts.
First, I haven't encountered any of the bugs others have mentioned, such as the optimization issues and the English-switched main menu upon exiting. My computer isn't particularly powerful, with just a 960 2GB GPU. The graphics can be set very high, so while some details may not be as sharp when zoomed in, the overall graphics are quite good. After all, I don't think simulation games are about graphics quality (I can handle full pixel count).
As a simulation game enthusiast, I've played many others, but this one is significantly different from other simulations because you're the decision-maker, not the builder. Every action you take is a decision-maker, and the only decision you can make is where to build. Therefore, building enthusiasts shouldn't buy this game. Every decision must be voted on by the council, which is the game's innovation. This makes it a game that emphasizes skill. It's not just about building anything you can afford. Some people complain that money is hard to come by, and that without it, the council won't listen. My secret is to take it slow. When you have little capital, slowly accumulate it. This game requires patience, and don't expect every decision to pass. Some decisions aren't very meaningful, so you can just agree to them and let them run their course. If they don't pass, you won't lose anything. As long as the parliamentary system tilts in favor of approval, the final vote is passed, and you don't have to dwell on it. For decisions you want to pass, you can use all three communication methods as appropriate. After all, if your favorability decreases, it will return after a while if you don't ask them for anything. With economic development, increasing tax revenue significantly increases your chances of passing taxes, so remember to raise taxes frequently to avoid running into a fiscal deficit.

Perhaps because it's a campaign, the game is quite repetitive. For example, some events are guaranteed to happen, and after playing through the same campaign multiple times, you always know what's coming next, which can feel a bit lacking in novelty. I strongly recommend the developers add a sandbox mode for increased replayability.

The game isn't particularly addictive, but it's challenging and not very casual, but I still enjoyed it. The game is fully in Chinese, with a fairly high level of translation. Great review! After all, this is only the first day of release, and there is still a lot of time to modify and add more elements. I am still optimistic about this game (how can this kind of game be considered complete without adding more than a dozen DLCs!)"
29389607,schinese,2017.00.21 08:22,✅,✅,0.5,2,"特地又来重新修改了评论。

首先我购买这个游戏主要是因为其政治系统的独创性。制作者试图通过不同阶级，不同政党相互制衡，总统进行取舍来增加游戏性，玩家不再是为所欲为了，要通过议会投票。仅凭这点就足够吸引我这个政治迷了。

但是游戏的实际体验却有点令人失望，没有感觉很深刻的运筹帷幄，互相制衡的感觉。个人感觉是由几个原因造成的。
1，游戏数据很多且繁杂，眼花缭乱，但是并没有感觉对游戏有什么太大价值。不知道对游戏内在逻辑有啥意义。比如各个阶层人民对各个党派支持度是多少，可是好像我知道这个也没啥用。。建议可以学习海岛大亨的一些东西，比如环保主义者看到工厂会愤怒，保皇派希望加强军队建设。。而玩家就需要在经济和支持间进行取舍。而这种体验我在该游戏中没有体会到。只感觉眼花缭乱。  另外在数据方面建议借鉴模拟城市之类的，有了丰富的图表比一堆数字生动的多。
2，平衡性有问题导致玩家能做的选择太少：多样性和选择性不多。本来能修建的建筑已经很少了，并且像学校医院又是必须要修建的。那么我就没有办法选择到底和哪派党进行交好，因为路线过于单一。而议案是玩家需要投入最多的界面，法案惩罚太低了，优点太明显，那么一般来说出了能推出的新法案，就不停进行提案就好了。这点还是建议借鉴海岛大亨，里面很多法案偏向性非常严重，必须逼迫玩家做出取舍。 另外建议在议案后对党派好感偏向进行惩罚奖励，而不是之前说服。由于游戏难度太低，导致议案太容易通过了，好感都太高，这降低了游戏乐趣。。。。
3，bug，仅进行了两个小时，我就遇到了三四个bug，比如没法保存（此时无法保存），比如第一个建的行政区没法点，导致我没法进行基础设施改造。比如退出后，一半游戏变成了英文。比如议会选择说服或者胁迫后你没法退出，必须再进行选择。比如你玩到第二个时代，退出存档，再从第一时代重新开始游戏，而政党居然变成了第二时代的。。。bug实在是太多了。。。否则玩家会怀疑制作者诚意的。

最后，感觉这个游戏创意很好。然而在最终成品上确确实实有太多问题了。主要体现在平衡性、自由度这两方面。感觉游戏机制还是要再考虑考虑。

无论如何非常喜欢这个政党议会的机制，希望游戏能有续集，并且续集可以有更丰富更平衡更多可以反复揣玩的内容，我还是会来支持的。希望游戏越做越好。",

Infrastructure is pointless; anyone who messes with people's livelihoods will perish. The optimization is also terrible. My 970 is trembling.

The idea of being a mayor, and trying to run and build a city, while appeasing council members is a novel idea. It does cause plenty of frustration, when you are turned down on a proposal that will turn your city around from going to downhill, but that is life I suppose. The game has an advanced idea, but a very simplistic implimentation of the game mechanics. Once you have figured out the way the game does things, and why the council votes no on different things, which almost always comes down to money, the game becomes very easy. Being easy, doesn't mean it is less fun though. 

 I know I put a ""No"" for would I recommend this game, which is kind of weird considering I do not think this game is bad, nor do I think it has any game breaking bugs that makes it unplayable, and all the bugs I have seen are so minor, they are barely noticeable. My only issue is the monotony of the gameplay after an hour or so, and what happens in Era III going forward from there. 

I only played for like 5 hours or whatever, and I do not know if things change in the 5th era, but the problem in Era 3, being forced to use most of your party support to just get re-elected, instead of on proposals you support, create an issue with gameplay. You do no need to be elected the first 2 eras, as you are appointed by the Emperor, but in Era 3 you must run for election, and convince the council to vote for you, the same way you do for any proposal. I spent far more support for the different parties in convincing them to vote me back in, every 6 years, than I ever could in advancing my city. My city literally came to a stand still for anything the council didn't wholeheartedly agree with already.

One top of this main problem, that I think needs some balancing to help players, I believe the game is not priced properly. This game should be $19.99, and at that price I would say it would sell two or three times as many copies, more than making up the difference in price they are charging, and I would recommend it to everyone. But at this price point, I think too many people would give up on the game after Era 3 and feel ripped off on such an expensive game. I really think these problems are extremely small on one hand, but too big for more to ignore, and recommend this game to anyone. If Kalypso were to get wise, and price the game better and adjust how elections are handled from Era 3 going forward, I would put this game above nearly all other city builder sims.

On nous livre ici un jeu très original et il est important de le souligner. Il ne s'agit pas d'un city builder comme pourrait l'être un Cities Skyline mais bien d'une gestion de ville principalement axée sur l'aspect politique que cela demande. L'idée est excellente et donne envie.

Premier point interessant, le jeu est en français. Ca peut sembler bête mais c'est un point qu'il faut souligner, il y a tout de même beaucoup de lecture à faire pour comprendre les décrets, les lois, les différents partis politiques, les technologies...
Traduction très bien réalisée.

La partie construction n'est pas le point central du jeu mais reste tout de même présente, elle est basique et peu de choix possible autre que la construction d'un quartier, mais c'est normal donc ce n'est pas un point noir. Vous dessinez un quartier et vous aurez différentes actions possibles, de plus en plus nombreuses au fil du temps sur ce quartier. D'ailleurs, au dela d'une gestion de ville, c'est aussi et surtout une gestion de plusieurs quartier qui ensemble, forment votre ville.
Vous aurez accès à des statistiques précisent et nombreuses pour chaque quartier. Vous pourrez leur ajouter des bâtiments publics comme un école, la police, les pompiers. Vous pourrez aussi leur donner accès à l'eau, aux égouts bref à beaucoup de choses suivant votre avancée technologique.

L'interface reste propre, simple et efficace mais a tout de même quelques soucis comme des textes tronqués car trop long et aucune tooltip nous donnant le mot complet au passage de la souris. Il y a d'ailleurs parfois certaines icones, dans les bonus qu'un décret apporte par exemple, qui n'ont pas de tooltip et nous savons donc pas toujours ce que le bonus apporte. Les Bonus d'ailleurs qui ne sont pas toujours clair dans leur compréhension.

J'en arrive aux deux points principaux, la gestion économique et politique.
La gestion économique consiste tout simplement à avoir suffisement d'argent dans les caisses de la ville pour financer de nouveaux projets et idéalement réussir à maintenir votre budget mensuel dans le positif. Alors y a du très bon et du moins bon mais je vais tout de même mettre mon manque d'expérience sur le jeu en avant pour ce que je considère comme moins bons. C'est difficile, presque ridicule, les constructions sont très chères et leur coût d'entretien mensuel sont titanesque. Mais je le redis, ce point est à prendre avec des pincettes, plus d'expérience sur le jeu rend les chose je pense plus abordable. Une chose dont je suis casi sur, c'est qu'il y a de véritables choix à faire car vous ne pourrez pas mettre une ecole, l'eau, le gaz, une clinique les yeux fermés, vous n'aurez pas le budget, il va falloir y aller doucement en comptant bien chaque centimes qui sort des caisses de la ville et ça c'est très agréable. 

Nous en arrivons à l'aspect politique du jeu et je suis tout aussi mitigé. L'idée est excellente, plutôt bien réalisé dans son ensemble. Il faut faire preuve de finesse, accumuler du capital politique représenté avec la reconnaissance que vous pourrez parfois dépenser pour demander du soutien à tel ou tel parti. Il ne va pas falloir tirer trop sur la corde au risque qu'on finisse par vous rire aux nez et qu'on ne vous écoute plus. Bref c'est vraiment cool. Oui cool, les premières heures.
On se dit ""Ha ouai c'est sympa"", on apprend a comprendre le système, on est pressé de voir arriver une nouvelle décision à prendre, faire voter un projet de loi, un decret, mais après plusieurs heures, on se rend compte d'une chose, c'est qu'en réalité il n'y a pas vraiment de choix. Déjà il n'y a casiment jamais aucune raison d'être contre un projet.

- Interdiction aux enfants de travailler avant 10 ans ? Ba oui
- Protection des animaux ? Ba oui
- Droit pour la femme d'être propriétaire ? Ba oui

Vous n'avez même pas besoin de faire pencher la balance, de jouer de votre influence, les decrets passent naturellement.
Quand bien même vous voudriez être contre ces lois, vous le pouvez, et vous pouvez même arriver en effet à ce que le conseil municipal s'y oppose, mais il n'y a aucun interêt à le faire.

En vérité, si on regarde dans la réalité, pour une question posée, il y a toujours des bonnes choses ET des mauvaises choses pour les OUI et pour les NON. Tu pèses justement les pour et les contres et tu prend une décision. Mais là, si tu fais passer la loi, tu as des bonus, et si tu ne la fais pas passer, bon t'as pas les bonus du OUI, mais t'as pas ni malus ni bonus du NON donc autant dire oui. Bref il y a aucune raisons qui te motive à te battre pour le oui ou pour le non.

J'ai une comparaison qui me vient, dans des city builders qui ont integrés la politique comme les décrets via un système très basique, on coche une case et hop le decret est appliqué. Dans Urban Empire c'est pareil en réalité, juste qu'au lieu de cocher une case, on nous demande si on veut la cocher ou pas, on attend une minute que le vote se termine auprès du conseil et voilà tu as ton décret.

Alors je vais tout de même terminer sur une dernière précision. Je reste convaincu qu'au fil des ères que le jeu propose, cela se complexifie, il y a plus de parti qui se crée, il y aura plus de choix et de vrai choix j'en suis convaincu. Je suis aussi convaincu qu'il y a des modificateurs cachés, que nos actions ont un poids auprès des partis sans forcément qu'on le sache, qu'il faut donc peser le pour ou le contre de temps en temps. Je suis convaincu qu'il faut parfois la jouer fine mais si j'ai raison, il est vraiment regrettable que le jeu ne nous fasse pas ressentir ce jeu politique dès le début.

 C'est pourquoi je le recommande tout de même, il reste très original, très plaisant les première heures, je n'ai pas encore assuez de recul pour valider définitivement certain de mes points négatifs. Il y a du challenge, c'est un bon jeu dans l'ensemble quand bien même l'avenir me donnerait raison concernant ce que je lui reproche. Maintenant comme toujours c'est mon ressenti, à voir le votre.

1. The tutorial doesn't quite help in instructing what to do. I was asked to create a new district, but the proposal didn't go through, so I had to wait some time to create the said district. All peachy, but now what? I've played for 20 more years, but no other pop-up to tell me what else to do. And of course there was no goal mentioned anywhere, however, I couldn't fully utilise all the features, because the institutions were locked (even though I've researched both the port and train station). So I had to start over the campaign.

2. The map is not fully displayed, not even as a minimap, nor can you move around by moving the cursor to the edge of it, so creating a new district or placing a service turns out to be quite hard to do, since you have to right click+drag to have visibility. 

3. Things get repetitive after a while - All you do is plead the council to approve your proposals and select choices on random events.

4. Technology vs city approvals - Ok, you have the electricity, water and gas unlocked, but your council is constantly REFUSING to adopt these technologies in the districts. No matter how much you plead, demand or threaten. So what's the point of having them, if you can't use them?

5. No clear explanation on how the economy works. You are just told in the tutorial that you can see the city data. But that's all. So you end up with bankrupt companies without explanation and the point mentioned above doesn't help either, since the companies can't expand/function due to the lack of resources.

Это приятный, довольно оригинальный медитативный симулятор мера с очень низким порогом вхождения. Одним из главных достоинств можно назвать временной период от 1820 до современности. Смотреть как развивается город из доиндустриальной эпохи очень интересно. Странно, почему не один именитый градостроительный симулятор до сих пор не реализовал такую возможность. Даже если шкала времени начинается с 19 века нам как правило показывают совремнную американскую деревню собязательным водопроводом и электростанцией. Здесь все логичнее. Электричество и канализация довольно затратные, а порой и ненужные горожанам опции в середине 19 века, а открытие театра становится событием века. Из забавных вещей стоит отметить возможность играть русской династией банкиров, филантропов и покровителей искусств. Твердая 4. Рекомендуется к приобретению.","This game isn't a city-building simulator, although it does allow you to indirectly change the appearance of your city, adding services and specialized buildings. It's a pleasant, rather original, meditative mayoral simulator with a very low entry barrier. One of its main advantages is the time period from 1820 to the present day. Watching a city develop from the pre-industrial era is very interesting. It's surprising that not a single renowned city-building simulator has yet implemented this feature. Even if the timeline begins in the 19th century, we are usually shown a modern American village with the obligatory running water and power plant. Here, everything is more logical. Electricity and sewerage were quite expensive and sometimes unnecessary for citizens in the mid-19th century, but the opening of a theater becomes the event of the century.

今天一出，我就立刻下载了，说说我这6个小时的测评吧
1.游戏内容很单一，事件重复度很高。
2.此游戏很容易进入到看海等科技的阶段，你什么都操作不了。
3.最重要的是，这个游戏的经济结构是崩溃的，所有公共设施的维护费用都是21K,但是你知道我一个1000人的社区还生产到不了这个费用，结果就是滚雪球的经济完全崩溃，你需要人口来提升工业和商业，但是提升人口需要完善基础建设，完善基础建设需要钱，但是你赚的根本入不敷出！
4.愚蠢的税收关系，想提升工业发展你需要减税，但是减税经济就崩溃，你必须要求议会加税收，结果就是工业一直更加的不景气。。。
5.在野党除了瞎BB，毫无存在感，你根本不能通过一些个人的手段来控制在野党的规模和一些特征，这些政党唯一有用的属性就是议会人数和你的关系，人数决定票数，关系决定你还能威胁他们多久，然而我威胁了6个小时，也没见他们把我怎么样，
6.愚蠢的城市规划，城市化为什么会城市化，就是在密集的人口情况下，利用公共资源，这游戏可好，如果说低等密度的人口需要两万的维护费用，中等密度人口需要8万，一个月八万的维护费用，这个游戏的工业情况下，我尝试了2遍，可能我自己没有诀窍，但是我确实无法让这中等秘籍的人口能够养活自己，造成经济的更加崩溃。
7.非常糟糕的优化，我的电脑是华硕的玩家国度，跑主流游戏完全没有问题，这个游戏在中等画质，高分辨率的情况下，丢帧非常非常严重，但是他并不是一个画面很好的游戏，所以还是优化的问题。
简而言之，这个游戏还是挺无聊的，辜负了我的期望，感觉没有一个模拟游戏的快乐，带给我就是无尽的经济崩溃和经济危机。

- Roleplay element in SimCity game let you soak in a little more, is fun to lead a family generation after generation)
- Graphics are decent
- Simple to play, but complex to understand
- The vote system makes the game more interesting
- Balancing your income is kinda fun when you try to min-max the gameplay
- District upgrade system
- Some nice events with humor (sadly less and less later in game)
- Technology tree is simple but fun

Why not to buy this game:
- Serious performace issue later in game (30fps? you wish, this must be patched or the game is not playable)
- Politycal parties do not make sense when voting (for example, before voting the game shows you that all parties are strongly against women right to vote base on their idealogy, it is 1800 so you know... but when voting they like 90% for it)
- More or less pointless edicts system (not enough information what is going on)
- Small maps (comparing to City Skyline it is like building on 1 plot out of 9)
- Technology tree is not clear enough

I would recomend to buy this game for 25$ or less, it is more or less how much I have payed. The game is fun, but need some serious work and optymization. 
Also this is small studio project, so I expected NoManSky2. That's probly why I kinda like this game, my expectations aren't to big for it.","Why you should buy this game:

城市建设方面，发明占了绝大部分，建设要素稍微有点低，你只能筹划一个行政区，具体细则却不归你管
目前只玩了1个小时左右，总体而言游戏还是很有趣味性的，只是需要一些更大规模的更新

评论追加：
时间这么久了还是没有大更新，只能说，不推荐购买，至少这个不是大众向类似海岛那类的游戏，这游戏玩起来属于比较压抑的风格，即使我自己青睐这种游戏，它也不是什么谁都能玩的游戏啊","The graphics are average, and the optimization isn't as high as I'd hoped. The official specs are clearly a bit exaggerated.

The game's verbal attacks are a bit overpowered, and the parliament doesn't play a significant role.

The game has a developmental element, and you decide what the next generation of city rulers will look like.

Inventing takes up the majority of the city-building effort, but the construction element is a bit low. You can only plan a single administrative district, but the specific details are beyond your control.

I've only played for about an hour, but overall the game is quite enjoyable, though it needs some major updates.

Additional review:
After all this time, and with no major updates, I can only say I don't recommend buying it. At least this isn't a game like the popular island game. It's a rather depressing experience. Even though I enjoy that kind of game, it's not for everyone."

Utilizing a district zoning method with other controls (such as adjusting the density of the district to be sparse or tight-knit, or changing the amount of lots dedicated to residential, commercial, etc.), you are able to plot out the literal squares of your city. However, the thing that caught most people off guard is that you don't manually place buildings except for municipal services (like schoolhouses, clinics, or fire stations). Most of the changes that impact the city and change the outlook of things take place in the senate where you propose tax hikes/cuts, adjust funding, and issue edicts for approval. Depending on the relationship between the mayor (player) and present political factions and their spot on the political compass, they will ultimately decide if you are able to carry out your plans.

This is a fairly unique management simulation.

You are a mayor who is one of several stereotypical dynasties who has been granted control of a city.

You take no direct hand in building it but must manage the city indirectly though successful political maneuvering of the council.

The game has a very familiar city-builder-esque cycle:
1. Choose and Object to build
2. Wait for budget to be positive enough to sustain it.
rinse, repeat

It adds a few other things to the cycle:
Petition the council for funding of your project or fund it yourself.
Intorduce laws and get them passed.

In between all this you must regularly make decisions on various events both random and othewise presented to you. These events can have bigger consequences than they first appear.

Early on in this game; I felt like all the options they give you in manageing the political parties were just different shades of the same flavor but the political system is actually much more subtely complex than I thought.

Another thing that ended up being more interesting than it first appeared is the economy.

Let me stress that the game ain't all that bad. The idea and the gameplay of this title is pretty fun. In theory.

The execution is less then stellar though as is the support, which is non existant for the most part. The main problems in this game is of a technical sort. The most annoying one is the lag at the endgame which ruins pretty much the whole experience. The second real issue is that the balance/moneymaking is just wrong in this game. It's really hard to make money and to keep your city nice and modern and if you do manage to make money you can't really do anything else.

A shame really as it could have been a real rough gem. Now it's just a sad ugly looking rock.","Sad state of affairs.

Pero, da igual. ¡Viva la Pepa! Ha más de un mes que he visto a alguno español jugar a él. Pero bueno es que vayamos mentalizándonos de que, precomprar el juego en verano no te da la categoría que tiene un youtuber con sus buenos 20000 suscriptores, por así decirlo. He puesto el jueguito del puto año a descargar a las seis de la tarde en punto. A los que no somos nadie, nos mata el ansia viva. Poco ha descargado, diríase. Parecióme ver que poco más de 2 Gigas. Bueno, es un city builder, no el buen Sandbox que se tercie, tan de moda. Inicio el juegazo absoluto o absolutista, es Trópico V pero en el Imperio Alemán, o Swadiano, lo llaman( a ver el buen copyright de Mount and Blade por eso de Swadia dónde está) ahora. Lo inicio como he dicho, sale una pantallita de presentación muy hermosa. Elijo un personaje que es una mezcla entre el Kaiser y Otto Von Bismarck y, alguna regla establecida que he roto por derechista y ansioso o, simplemente que, un producto que hemos pagado por adelantado y que, otros han disfrutado antes que nosotros, pobres muchedumbres mortales; simplemente, digo, puede ser que sea una mierda absoluta y una estafa. No debería, me digo, si ha dos meses que los grandes profetas lo están jugando. No, o sí. La muestra que le han dado a los profetas, está bien pulidita, es propaganda, no vamos a anunciar mierda. La mierda, para los tontos que lo han pagado por adelantado y que esperen hasta Enero, de añadidura.
Ya me la hiciste con Trópico 5, Kalypso. Pero ésta, ya no te la paso. Verás cómo implemento yo ahora mi puto Urban Empire, pero en la realidad.
No hay forma de jugarlo, damas y caballeros. Tal vez, primero os encontréis con el problema ese del crasheo al iniciarlo. Se pone la pantalla negra y ni pa atrás, ni pa alante. Dicen que es porque no aguanta resoluciones superiores a 1080, en mitad del 2017, no en 1917, Kalypso. Bien, buena explicación, salvo que yo lo tengo a 1080. Cuando consigáis hacerlo andar, os va a maravillar cuán bien funciona. Se iniciará y la cámara empezará a dar vueltas y vueltas y vueltas. Ya no hace falta colocarse ni nada, para que todo te dé vueltas. Pon este jueguito y lo verás. Y de la mala hostia, te dará vueltas todo el exterior, también. Irás al foro y pondrá: desconecta todos los controladores. Lo harás y seguirá todo de esa suerte.
Conclusión: gran simulador social ultrarrealista. A continuación, procederé a desinstalarlo y, después, pediré el reembolso a Steam. Y, en cuanto se pueda, llamaré al organismo correspondiente y les expondré el caso que les interesará cuanto menos. ¿Veis? Gran simulación social. Y realista. Muy recomendable.","It's finally here. Finally. The game of the fucking year. I've been waiting for it since July or August. And well paid for in advance in those months. But, whatever. Viva la Pepa! I've seen a Spaniard playing it for over a month now. But hey, let's start to realize that pre-purchasing the game in the summer doesn't give you the status that a YouTuber with a good 20,000 subscribers has, so to speak. I've set the game of the fucking year to download at six o'clock in the evening sharp. For those of us who are nobodies, the urge to download it is killing us. It hasn't downloaded much, so to speak. I thought I saw just over 2 GB. Well, it's a city builder, not the good old sandbox game that's so fashionable. I'm starting the absolute or absolutist game; it's Tropico V, but in the German Empire, or Swadian, they call it (let's see where the good copyright of Mount and Blade is, because of that Swadia thing). I start it, as I said, and a very nice little splash screen appears. I choose a character who's a cross between the Kaiser and Otto von Bismarck, and some established rule I've broken because I'm right-wing and anxious, or simply that a product we paid for in advance and that others have enjoyed before us, poor mortal crowds; simply put, I say, it could be absolute crap and a scam. It shouldn't, I tell myself, if the great prophets have been playing it for two months. No, or maybe it is. The sample they gave the prophets is well polished, it's propaganda, we're not going to announce shit. The shit, for the fools who paid in advance and can wait until January, to top it off.
You already did it to me with Tropico 5, Kalypso. But I'm not letting you have this one. You'll see how I implement my fucking Urban Empire now, but in reality.
There's no way to play it, ladies and gentlemen. Maybe you'll first encounter that crashing problem when you start it. The screen goes black and there's no going back or forward. They say it's because it can't handle resolutions higher than 1080p, in the middle of 2017, not 1917, Kalypso. Well, good explanation, except I have it at 1080p. When you get it working, you'll be amazed at how well it works. It'll start up and the camera will start spinning around and around and around. You don't need to position yourself or anything to make everything spin. Launch this game and you'll see it. And, to my chagrin, the whole exterior will spin around too. Go to the forum and it'll say: Disconnect all controllers. You'll do it, and everything will continue like that.
Conclusion: great ultra-realistic social sim. Next, I'll uninstall it and then request a refund from Steam. And, as soon as possible, I'll call the relevant agency and explain the case, which will be of interest to them at least. See? Great social simulation. And realistic. Highly recommended."

Basically, all they had to do was give us a more polished version of Tropico, with a more in-depth political model.  They attempted to kind of do that, but then changed the building process (and ease of).  For instance, in order to even build your city, you basically have to build ""wards"" and plan out their outlines.  And interesting concept, but totally un-needed and annoying.  Then the game is basically goes into auto mode, building it's own houses and such, where it wants to ... which totally disrupts your plan for city buildings such as police stations, schools, etc.

On top of that, after you place a ""ward,"" it's then broken into different zones, residential, industrial, etc.  From what I can tell, it just randomly assigns these zones, depending on the terrain.  Again, totally annoying and screws up the building process.   30 minutes in, and I still can't figure out how to place the Train Station.  It really shouldn't be this difficult or clumsy.

Tutorial is a joke.
Luckily I a got a refund.

So TLDR:
Clumsy, complicated building and planning
Control taken out of players hands/ distributed by random assignment
Politics not really engaging  
All we needed was a polished and engaging build-off from Tropico ... but they threw the best parts of Tropico out
Music and sound, meh.","I'm a huge fan of the Tropico series, by Kalypso, so naturally I was excited to see this title coming out.  I pre-ordered it, and almost right away I could tell this was not the game for me.

I'm not very happy with the game in its current state.
It's lacking a real challenge, and the political parties feel like regular obstacles to make it harder. For me, it also lacks more options for ""perfectionists"" like me to ""micro-manage"" the city to the final and last detail, like for example managing the road grids, instead of just three options for it. The price I also feel is too much for what it is now. If updates bring more, I'll maybe buy it again and see if it makes a difference.


I really don't know what to say about this game.... A part of me likes it, and a part of me doesn't.
The main reason is because this game was much more ""lean back"" than I expected, it automatically builds road grids, and automatically decides where and how much to put industrial, residential etc. I expected a much more Cities: Skylines type of thing, with political implementations. Instead what I got, was a boring ""don't worry about this we'll do it for you!"" type of game. No challenge at all, hardly anything to do, and things become repetitive quickly. I also noticed the graphics of the buildings degrade a lot when you're not zoomed in on them, they literally become white squares with black windows (played on ultra).

I'll list some of my Pro's and Con's.

[h1] Pro's [/h1]
- Game was fun and intriguing for the first hour.
- Feels and [i] is [/i] different from other city management/builders.
- The soundtrack is amazing.

[h1] Con's [/h1]
- Graphics could be better.
- Price tag is drunk, even the 35€ pre-order price I paid for it.
- Game becomes dull quickly.
- The AI is as dumb as me.
- The UI is confusing, and the ""benefits"" from doing things are poorly explained. 5% Sales demand = ?.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
I wish Steam had an option that was in between ""Yes"" or [b] ""NO"" [/b].
If you like really easy city management/builders with close to no manual control over the layout with political implementations, this might be for you. If you're willing to pay 45€.
I think a more fitting price would be around 15 - 20€.
For now, I'm going to give this a no. I'll probably try to get a refund.
If updates supposedly improve upon the game, I'll maybe buy it again and try it out.
But again, for now, I'm not happy with the game in it's current state. 


[b] Should you buy it? [/b]
Maybe, I think a price reduction would make it worth it. The game is still getting updated, so hopefully they'll add something to make it better.

Tiene en total 2.500 eventos aleatorios que pueden ir surgiendo a partir de las nuevas o viejas partidas que tu tengas; en lo personal, es un juego que recomiendo mucho..

Lo malo:

No esta en español por el momento.
Aveces se nota que le falta optimizar un par de temas, pero no es nada grave.
Y muchas otras pequeñeses... por que todo el tiempo que llevo jugado, no me ha dado errores ni me ha sacado del juego.
Luego de un largo tiempo puede que se te vuelva repetitivo.
Pocos escenarios. (En lo que a mi respecta)

Lo bueno:
Tienes bastantes horas garantizadas por día, con la inmensa cantidad de eventos aleatorios que tiene.
Varias familas, cada uno con un posible heredero y sus propios rasgos.
Distinta variedad de edificios; aunque en este tema le doy un 8/10.

I rather enjoy it, because with the political aspect, you need to pick and choose your battles. Always strongarming the council into getting your way WILL backfire on you.
Build new districts when the economy is booming, increase taxes when it's in the red and always keep at least 10X the city's income in the treasury for cases where the economy turns around.

The council is remarkably reasonable as long as you don't strong arm them. They will go against their own political compass if the economy is threatened or if it's booming and play to the approval of the public. If your city has high education, even the conservatives are likely to vote yes on progressive matters to avoid loosing approval.
And if you have trouble getting something trough the council, like expanding infastructure in a district? Do it in steps as it's much easier to get trough.

However if you try to play it like any other city builder and constantly strongarm even your political enemies.. you're going to have a bad time. So don't do it. Go with the political flow and try to focus on a healthy economy with your own ideals for the city being secondary.

Doing as described above, I was able to expand the city into 6-7 districts before the first era was over and with a few 100k in income, which I managed to expand into over a million by the third era. As a result I only ever had to persuade or strongarm the council in 1 or 2 matters so far, and where the vote didn't go my way or I needed to get it trough despite the council makign it impossible, I just overturned it instead of trying to strongarm every party and move them into negative approval as i seemed to take a much lower hit from overturning the vote and the good will bounces much faster back from a 1-2 hit accross the board than from a 5-8 hit on a few parties.

Also if you have trouble starting off and expanding, then start out by raising taxes 3-4% and as soon as you're in the positive after building the first district, zone another before you start adding services. It'll give you a bigger starting population & industry which will help keep your economy strong and make it much easier to continue expanding after adding services.","City builder with the political aspects of games like Democracy 3, and a Penultimo cameo.

Die Politischen Parteien sind vollkommen falsch aufgestellt. So war damals eine Konsevative partei und eben auch der Adel niemals für linke Politik. Das Gesetz zur Legaliesierung von Gewerkschaften wäre niemals mit den Monachie treuen konsevativen umzusetzen. Außerdem saßen sie damals in der Mitte des Parlaments ;) und nur die Nationalisten am rechtem Rand.
Das Parlament ist sehr lieblos annimiert. Alle bewegen sich gleich und eine hitzige(geräuschvolle) Debatte wäre echt stimmungsvoller. Allgemein findet für das Auge wenig statt. Die Straßen sind leer . Also ein langweiliges Parlament und auch bei der Stadtabbilung ist wenig ansprechendes zu sehen. Man muss sich schon stark auf die Texte konzentrieren.
Damals wurden demokratische Gedanken erst heimlich publiziert durch illegale Druckerpressen(die dann hochgenommen wurden) und schließlich auf der Straße ausgetragen.
Allgemein könnte man da noch Demos und jubelnde Massen die auf die politischen Ereignisse reagieren hinzufügen.
Ich fasse zusammen : 
- falscher Kontext
- lieblose Annimationen
- total oberflächliche Zeitgeistsimmulationen
- wenig wirtschaftliche Zusammenhänge

von der Idee her nicht schlecht aber mies umgesetzt und garantiert keine 40 Euro wert.
Auch wenn das, dass erste Spiel seiner Art ist.

TL, DR: In a game espousing political wrangling, manipulation, and development there is only one political path available and it will happen whether you pursue it or not; the other parties will eventually pass every edict that is beneficial/required (unions, child labour laws, etc.) without any need for input. There are no significant historical decisions to make, as history is single-tracked (so no alt-history fun), your decisions are irrelevant and coercing the political parties is pointless anyways because there is only one outcome no matter who you play as.

=====Normal Review Follows=====
The citybuilding element of this game is simplistic (not bad) and a little awkward at times (having to modify/improve infrastructure on each small district individually): it's serviceable, given that the game is focused on the political landscape.

Unfortunately this is where the game (from what I've seen so far) falls flat. Playing a technocratic mayor I found that the only social progress I would ever meaningfully make was towards the ideals of the modern left; nearly all of the conservative ones seemed to have drawbacks whereas liberal ones were purely beneficial. Why would this bother me, given that I am (for want of a better term) liberal? Because there was no teeth to the opposition. There was no temptation. The populace inevitably voted left-wing and thus all edicts were effortlessly passed to support their policies, while the conservative groups languished, ineffective, in the background. Was it because I educated my populace that they so overwhelmingly supported such efforts? It's impossible to tell, since education is required just to keep the population content.

To compound matters a selling point of the game is marching onward through the eras with the political tribulations that followed. Unfortunately these matters seem to have almost no impact on anything you do in-game. A recession hit and I lost some income but recovered regardless. The Emperor was deposed and fled to my nation but no apparent benefits, drawbacks, or gameplay mechanics followed. Russia gets invaded by bloody France and there is no evident impact on my city. There's no alt-history, as has been confirmed by others, and there doesn't seem to be any way to influence politics or even be influenced _by_ politics, at least from what I have currently seen.

Next playthrough we'll see if a nationalistic luddite will actually change the way the game goes, or if it's all just kicking and screaming into the mundane future without regard for the possibilities that would emerge from quirky alt-history antics.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So far, so bad. Only way to progress is through unions, rights, etc. Spent the entire first two parts of the campaign resisting Unions (despite them having no mechanical downside and, I believe, being absolutely necessary to upgrade your economy/income), but ultimately it's futile. 

While you can use underhanded means to usurp other political parties there doesn't seem to be any reason to do so. Over time they'll want to pass various laws that will only improve your society/income/etc. As previously stated, these edicts are almost exclusively left-leaning and there are no means to, say, create a human rights abusing society like China. 

In a game where the entire draw is the political wrangling and manipulation, why is there only one political route to pursue that offers any success and is met with minimal resistance regardless of which parties you court? Hell, the conservative (or just abusive) policies I try to set offer me little but political gain with the party I already associate with, while the liberal/human rights ones give political capital, popularity, and economic advantages.

I feel like I'm railroaded into playing the game only one way. Despite having four ""Dynasties"" a tthe start (which, too, are preset) and the tagline being the option to influence decisions such as womens' rights and child labour, there is literally no reason to oppose any of it. Whether you pick the human rights advocate or the tech-hating luddite conservative it all ends the same way and trying to change it does nothing but prolong the inevitable.

玩了一个通宵，睡醒了来补充一下测评
优点在于
优秀的中文配音，可能是2017年年度中文配音了！（暴打文明6捧读）
但是游戏的字库可能有些问题，少部分字都是方块字。
如果喜欢维多利亚2的朋友，估计这款游戏也会喜欢。

好了，我已经憋了已经很久了，我们来说一下这游戏一些很“迷”的地方。
这游戏就是典型的有钱就是爷，没钱就是孙的教科书范例。可能再第一时代还不是很明显，但是到了第二时代之后就凸显这个问题了。人类要进步，工业要需求，工业不在满足于低端加工生产，他们需要下水道，需要自来水，甚至需要电力。工业再进步，人文同时也在进步，人们不在满足于人文学校那点扫盲的知识。人们需要职业学校，高中。不在满足于下班后在家撸管干炮消遣娱乐，他们又需要剧院，但是这些都是茫茫多的维护费。前面说了，这是一个你拉屎都要投票的游戏，如何维持这不多的维护费？有人像“教程”饮鸩止渴一般的说提高商业的税率，但是提高税率虽然可以带来不菲的收入，但是会牺牲工业商业的吸引度。并且这游戏提高税率看起来很简单，基本上都是各党派支持，如果你想降低税率，吸引招商，那么你麻烦大了，基本上都不会给你好脸色看看。如果发现自己25格大的小地盘无法维持这么多公立建筑的维护费的时候，或许扩大地盘也是一个愚蠢的选择。你以为会像开局那样商店工厂拔地而起吗？并不会，基本上除了居民区会有人来住之外其他地都不会有人来。
这时候你慌了！你知道你麻烦大了，每月负几十甚至上百的维护费把你惊呆了，这游戏财政赤字不是好玩的，甚至大额的负收入都似乎给你挖着坟墓。如果财政突然赤字，那么就意味着基本上所有的党派都和你作对，你除了提高税率之外的所有提案。比如更改区域比例配置，全部都会给你投上反对票。
然后你过着天天给皇帝写信要钱，但是就算又存款因为财政收入为负数所有人对着你干你什么事情都干不了最后默默地退回菜单然后重开一局。",

-个人的性格比较像后三个家族，我自己第一个档选的是工人阶级的家族，虽然我觉得背景设定都很有趣，但是我们自身谁最早不是草根出身的呢，比较奋斗和励志。 	我认为要多改革，虽然改革是很难成功的，但是不进行一些改变的话久而久之旧有的制度不再适应新的时代就容易得“大企业病”。

一开始进游戏没有发现沙盒模式，顿时有一些失望，战役和场景的自由度和感觉终究是有限的。我个人玩任何模拟游戏都尽量不会去玩战役甚至教程

第一感觉画面很差说实在的不像17年的游戏，我一般来说对画面不是很在意，因为喜欢很多好的模拟游戏都是独立作品，以前最迷恋的就是像素风格的开罗游戏了，可是这个画面和光泽感觉很生硬，非常的别扭，眼睛很是难受。

之后发现很多的选项注释特别的少，有的甚至没有注释，而且对玩家来说这个游戏的界面跟画面一样很是生硬，很是不友好。议会界面似乎是想要搞的有真实感一样的画面，其实整个画面对我来说要看的就是右侧和上方的条，结果弄的花里胡哨的不必要的东西，完全没办法直观明了的知道自己想要知道的信息。整个游戏的可玩性不怎么样，完全不明白时间条的意义在哪里。仿佛东拼西凑了一堆东西然后很粗糙的搭建了起来的游戏。而且不知道是游戏的问题还是怎么样的，这个汉化感觉完全没有诚意啊

对于某些因为游戏出中文和中文语音就支持的人，在我看来很多人太自卑了，“洋大人平时都不搞中文的，这位洋大人居然这么重视我们，我们一定要报答支持。”我感觉很多人就是这种想法。从什么时候开始玩游戏玩的从游戏变成了语言呢？曾经的游戏支持中文 也支持中文语音，可是玩家们却抛弃了他们，玩起了盗版，而今天却正好相反。以前是薅（hāo）帝国主义的羊毛，而现在是反对反华游戏厂商。

对我来说选择游戏的最大因素永远是游戏性。其他的都不是问题，我是要不吭不卑的玩游戏，外国厂商对哪国玩家怎么样，跟我没关系，虽然我也总是找汉化，可我首先是个玩家，其次才是中国玩家。没有中文就汉化补丁，没有汉化补丁就硬玩。现在这种有中文就买，要不就嚷嚷说没中文不买了，算什么呢？我玩过一些以出了中文而火热的游戏，我不能忍受让那种仅仅因为出了中文就能赚钱的烂游戏出头。都什么时候了还人傻钱多，都醒醒吧，别被政治被民族影响了吧",

29384453,english,2017.00.21 01:54,✅,✅,0.6745314598,32,"Anyone can build a city - not many can RULE a city.  Fair warning, this isn't another SimCity or Cities: Skylines - this is the political game BEHIND the running of the city, with a little smattering of city building and planning mixed in.  Where you would plan to build a police station, and how to route roads was the bread and butter of city planning games - how to get the city to run effectively through city councel politics is this games focus.  This also means that you have to learn the political game of schmoozing, pleading, walking the fine line between love and hate - and not making enemies.

Pros:
+ Different approach to a genre that has recently enjoyed an upswing
+ Making friends and influencing people really has an impact on things, versus just making money the primary factor in something failing or succeeding.
+ Different political families present something to latch onto as the player - you are playing a role, not just some invisible semi-god making decisions about things affecting everyone else.
+ The different eras allow you to see how progress affects decision-making.
+ Tool-tips on many concepts allow you to grasp the games concepts without digging out a PDF manual (or printing them off, if you are 'pen and paper' kind of ruler...)

Cons:
- Some of the random events seem to not be well described - so choices seem arbitrary.
- Difficulty lacks granular controls to allow you to ease into this new hybrid genre of a game, you either catch on and succeed or you don't - and you end up restarting when it all goes to ****.

I think the game would be worthy of a good 70-78% approval rating.  Good roots, but needs some smoothing over in spots to really make it a knock-out.  Definitely worthy of the pre-order cost, a good choice with a small 'wait-and-see' recommendation at full retail price.  Kalypso always seems to iron out the wrinkles in their games, and they will likely do so with this one as well.  

Just remember - ruling the city requires politics, politics is playing nice with others, if you don't play nice with others - this game is going to be really hard for you.","Anyone can build a city - not many can RULE a city.

𝙸 - Tiefgehende Politsimulation mit Einer Menge Potential

Neutral: ~
𝙸𝙸 - Schwer überschaubare Bewegungen in Gewerbe und Wirtschaft. 
𝙸𝙸𝙸 - Das Tutorial ist unintuitiv und hält damit die Lernkurve extrem flach.

Contra: -
𝙸𝚅 - Tooltips und direkte Informationen zu Ereignissen/Symbolen sind eine Rarität, was für solch ein komplexes Spiel ein No-go sind.


Initialpost:
(𝙸)Als Tropico 4- und Tropico 5-Besitzer habe ich bisher einen recht positiven Eindruck davongetragen. Bin direkt mit Beginn der Downloadfreigabe mit am Testen und kann im Augenblick keinerlei gröbere Bugs feststellen.

Einziger ""Bug"" bisher ist, dass ich Info erhalten habe nach einem von meinem Charakter bestätigtem Eisenbahnprojekt, dass 'er an der Baustelle des Bahnhofs vorbeispazieren würde um die Bauten zu inspizieren', was zu dem Zeitpunkt eigentlich unmöglich war, da ich das Bahnhofsbauprojekt noch gar nicht umgesetzt hatte. Doch ganz im Ernst... das sind kosmetische Feinheiten, keine Gamebreaker o.ä.
Falls meine Wenigkeit darauf stoßen sollte, wird das hier prompt nachgetragen, aber bisher haben wir hier ein gemütliches Politik-Städtebau-Spielchen.

Folgender Kritikpunkt nach den ersten 3 Stunden:

• Tooltips(𝙸𝚅) - Sollten wirklich öfter bei Mouseover erscheinen und mehr Hintergrund zum einzelnen Icon anzeigen(Siehe Screenshot unten):
So habe ich zum Beispiel beim Erfolgreichen Umsetzen des Arbeiterschutzgesetzes drei Punkte(Symbole) untereinander, die mit dem ""Nachfrage steigt""-Symbol(danke an dieser Stelle für den Tooltip) versehen sind, jedoch neben drei (vermutlich Rohstoffproduktionen?) Symbolen, alias Bereiche, die davon beeinflusst werden, welche ich so nicht wiederfinden konnte. Somit bleibt einem in dem Moment eine gelupfte Braue und ein ""guuut"" auf den Lippen kleben, wenn man sich gern über die Auswirkungen schlau gemacht hätte.

[u][Review-Update 1: ""bAnalitäten""][/u]

Folgende(r) Kritikpunkt(e) nach den weiteren 6 Stunden:

• Musikstücke - Wirkt auf Dauer sehr repititiv. In geistigen Vorgängern wie Tropico fiel dieser Punkt weniger auf. In dem Fall ist es wohl den recht markanten, klassischen Stücken zuzuordnen. Ich musste zwischenzeitlich einfach artverwandte Musikstücke im Hintergrund anwerfen, damit man nicht schon zu Beginn zu viel von den gefühlt drei Musikstücken bekommt. Nichts für ungut, es sind schöne, passende Tracks, aber die werden nach dem 100sten Mal leider nicht mehr besser. ;)
Musikstil ist ironischerweise eine Mischung aus Die Sims Einkaufsmusik, Sims Mittelalter und Gilde 2. Mittendrin ertappt man sich doch dabei, einen neuen Einrichtungsgegenstand besorgen zu wollen...

• Kosten/Nutzen-Effekt Ingame(𝙸𝙸) - Es scheint im Moment doch sehr schwer kontrollierbar und schwer einsehbar, welche Züge man beim Gebäudebau an den Tag legen muss, um Gewinn einzufahren.  Mittlerweile scheint es gar so, als wären durch Erlasse erteilte ""Steuern"", wie Alkohol- und Tabaksteuer ein relativ unbedeutender Faktor in Sachen ""Einnahmen"". Ebenso gestaltet es sich mit dem ""regulierten Glücksspiel"", welches meines Verständnisses eigentlich wie in der staatlich kontrollierten Lotterie Einnahmen zur Hälfte der tatsächlichen Investition der Bürger erzielen sollte. Doch auch hier ist der Impact kaum bemerkbar. Für mich scheint sich alles auf die Besteuerung von Bürgern und Industrie hinauszulaufen, welche scheinbar kontinuierlich anzusteigen hat.
Auf der anderen Seite sitzt der monatliche Kostenfaktor von meist mehreren tausend K(ronen?). Bedeutet also, dass es für jedes Infrastrukturupgrade, jedes Dienstleistungsgebäude und nicht standard-Zonenbesiedlungsdichte hohe, monatliche aufkommen, welche sich stets nur mit einer Methode wieder in den grünen Bereich der Einnahmen bringen lassen: der Steuerschraube. Es wirkt beinahe unglaubwürdig, wie sehr sich Industrie und Bürger das auf Dauer stetig gefallen lassen, aber vielleicht ändert sich das mit höheren Epochen ja noch.

Screenshot-Showcase*:
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=846887085  

• Tutorial generell(𝙸𝙸𝙸) - Das Tutorial selbst scheint sich am Prinzip ""learning by doing"" zu ergötzen, was im Grunde positiv wirkt, da unaufdringlich und beiläufig, doch die Schwierigkeit hierbei ist, dass es teils auf einen Glückstreffer hinausläuft, ob man wieder ein tutorialwürdiges Ereignis triggert oder nicht. Hier wären etwas klarere Grundinstruktionen hilfreich gewesen. Etwas, das klar macht, dass man besser auf Verteilungsauswahl forschen sollte, welches unter der Erfindung ""Telegraph"" zu finden ist. Ohne die kontrollierte Verteilung von Wohn-, Gewerbe- und Industrie-Flächen in einem Stadtviertel ist es wie ein Würfelspiel, wie sich die drei Faktoren gerade zusammensetzen. Ich persönlich hatte lange Zeit einen viel zu hohen Anteil an Unbeschäftigten, da die Wohnhausanteile höher waren als Gewerbe oder Industrie, aus eben jenem Grund, weil ich den Telegraphen leider erst recht spät erforscht hatte.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=846881961


• Interagieren mit Parteien bei Abstimmungen(𝙸𝚅) - Auch hier wäre es um einiges einfacher, hätte man Tooltips, die eine gewisse Prozentanzeige offenbart, wie wahrscheinlich eine Partei auf ihre Bitte/Forderung/Drohung/[spoiler]Erpressung[/spoiler](<= durch Forschung freigeschaltet) reagiert.

[u][Review-Update 2: Liebloses Tutorial bei einem Spiel mit großem Potential!][/u] - 23.01.17

Jemand, der das Spiel noch nicht besitzt, möchte sich fragen, wie das Fortschrittsempfinden in dieser Politik-Sim ist. Dafür gibt es einen recht einfachen, bildlichen Vergleich:
- Man stelle sich ein wildes Pferd vor, dem man als Laie beibringen möchte, dass es gehorchen muss und einen nicht permenent vom Sattel werfen sollte. Ein Pferdedompteur(alias Tutorial) könnte einem dabei eine solch große Hilfe sein, wie ein Lift einem Gepäckwagen, der das Stockwerk wechseln muss. Nun. Dieser Dompteur steht allerdings eher an der Ecke der Koppel und raucht genüsslich eine und winkt einem zu als wäre alles was da gerade passiert normal, während sich der Reiter(Spieler) vielmehr in der Luft und am Boden, als auf dem Pferd wiederfindet.
Man muss also auf die harte Tour die Details des Spiels kennenlernen, sich einleben und dann nach Instinkt Dinge auf den Weg bringen, in der Hoffnung, dass nicht im nächsten Moment die äusserst fluktuierende Wirtschaft [u]ohne ersichtlichen Grund[/u] bankrott geht - Geschäft für Geschäft...


Dieses Informationsvakuum ist ein Kernkriterium und sollte in den nächsten Patches behoben werden. Sollte sich abzeichnen, dass hier die Politik von Battlefront und co gefahren wird, dass Kritische Lücken nur mit DLC-Käufen gefixt werden können, wird diese Empfehlung hinfällig werden! Wenn man sich so unbekümmert unverschämt wie EA, Ubisoft oder Blizzard verhält, sollte man nicht dem Trugschluss unterliegen, dass das der Schlüssel zu einer langen Firmenexistenz ist - man siehe Jowood, Freunde des kapitalistischen Augenkneists...

More parties and the growth of the number of people in parties as in population growth. More grid options, Diffrent mayor governments would be nice. Overall it's fun but I felt like I was doing the same thing everytime.Also mod support would make this game amazing. 

P.s People are mad that I think the price is too high? I like the game, just needs more stuff for that price."

Pros:
+ Game is not that big to download
+ keeps you at your toes all the time due to the politics changing allot after what you do ingame.
+ like the district building system.
+ good tutorial for the starters.

Cons:
- starting to getting very complex to get past Era 3",

This game is a great mashup of city builder and political strategy. Sort of a mix between Cities: Skylines, Democracy, Crusader Kings, and Civilization.

The game is easy enough to work with, the basics are well explained though I've started over 2 times already because boy does it present a challenge.

Growth is limited by both your bank and your political prowess, if you're too against the grain right off the bat anything you try and get done is going to be voted out while if you appease the parties you get some clout that you can use to push your own agenda.

One issue that I have run into is the camera, it is much easier to use the keyboard controls for it than to use the mouse ro else you'll end up spinning the camera around wildly and never really get it into the right spot.

Placing of buildable areas, called districts, is by far one thing that is really nice. With other city builders every road and zone was placed by hand, now you control how much of what zone type (typical RCI) you want and they are auto placed with roads already there.

Want to build a park or a church? You can, using services, though the coucil will need to vote on any changes that are made, unless you're paying for it out of your own pocket. And yes, here you have personal funds as well as city funds and you get paid every month.

If you like city builders, strategy games, or political strategy games this is a game you will probably get a lot of enjoyment out of.","I just hit the 2 hour mark on this game and I had to review it.

2) The UI is clunky -- having to toggle between too many panels to do simple actions. 

3) Use dense grid. Always dense grid. Theres no strategy in which zones to use. Infact, using sparse grids will cost you more by far  as you have to cover all that space with extra services.

Urban Empire tries to mix story-telling aspects with city-building and strategic maneuvering in politics.
I watched let's plays of this before release and I am not terrible shocked to find that the strategy part is a bit shallow and the city building is not the focus of the game. So maybe we should understand this as political story-telling game?

Unfortunately those aspects are not presented in a way that makes me want to find out more. The political maneuvering I found very straightforward and while this might get more difficult later on, nothing I've seen in any of the previews suggests that the way to handle the different parties changes significantly. I think the system might work quite well in a role playing playthrough where you stick with one ideology and try to press it through regardless of what the council thinks though.
Which brings me to the storytelling aspect. Unfortunately none of the political parties feel alive enough to make for good stories and your personal story as the mayor character is restricted to a few largely inconsequential events

The graphics are well done and follow a coherent style. However, the rest of the presentation definitely feels subpar. Let's just say multiple missing or wrong tooltips and spelling errors just in the first hour of the game doesn't leave a good first impression.

So in summary a great and novel idea that sadly falls flat in the execution and does nothing to make me want to play more. I guess there might be some potential in here as a political role playing simulator, but I just find the core game play not very engaging.","[b]TL;DR:[/b] An interesting idea for a novel genre that sadly does not manage to keep my interest.

P.S. 2 Hr passed, stil great game.

游戏也很不错，每个家族、每个地图、每个科技都各有特色。虽然不是沙盒，却很有重复可玩性。

报纸很有特色，随着时代推移，里面出现很多和当时真实历挂钩的梗。看得出来翻译还是很用心的。很多梗都翻出来了。同时各种政治模拟，非常有纸牌屋的感觉。

OK, das Problem mit dem Drehen ist gelöst Controller getrennt... danke Forum... das Spiel dreht sich nicht mehr im Kreis. 
Aber ein richtiges bzw. besseres Tutorial hätte dem Spiel gut getan, die Schaltflächen und Hinweise (soll wohl das Tutorial sein) lassen mich mit vielen Fragen zurück... ich weiß dass ich hier und da klicken soll, aber das warum kommt leider nicht rüber.
Die Zoomfunktion ist sehr bescheiden, ich kann nicht wirklich weit rauszoomen, als dass ich einen Überblick bekommen könnte - geht wohl erst ab 4K Auflösung oder so.
Und eigentlich habe ich bis jetzt noch immer keinen Plan, was ich genau tue... nächster Step: schauen ob es ein Handbuch gibt, dass mehr enthält als eine Gesundheitswarnung ;)

29382108,english,2017.00.20 23:42,✅,✅,0.851318717,142,"Pretty good game, but not yet great. Only on my first playthrough, but it scratches a lot of the itches I have in gaming. 

- It has a simplified citybuilding part, which I welcome as it has a clear place in the game.  
- It has political simulation. This is also a bit simplistic at parts. You basicly buy votes with goodwill, there is not that much to it so far, if you have enough goodwill, you can swing votes in your favor, and goodwill goes to a default state which depends on you general standing in the city. So far I haven't done anything in particular to make this good and I have not had any problems getting what I want. I will update this review if it turns out that the system is deeper later in the game. 
- It has dynasty building. I love this, you have choices to make about your son, who you get to play later. 
- it has a pretty large research tree with narration when something is discovered, a bit of Civilization feeling. 

So to me it seems it has elements of Sim City, The Guild, Civilization and Crusader Kings. I don't think they are just mashed together without thought. I think they work just fine. 

I only have two complaints so far. The first is what I already said, the political system should be a bit more complicated. I just know when I've spent enough goodwill to get the vote, because it tells me how many will vote yes and no and so far there hasn't been any surprises. Everything is a bit simple, but that's not necessary a bad thing as the game has many layers and if all were complicated it would get lost in them. However the main attraction should be a bit deeper (unless it's depth is gradualy introduced, in which case as I said I'll update the review). 
The second is technical. I wish it was possible to increase drawing distance. I don't have any technical problems or glitches, it works fine, but objects dissappear very soon. 

I'm having fun so far, hope replayability won't be a problem. So far, recommended. 

(To be honest, I thinks it's too early to review at all for anyone, but already the ""I play on an abacus and it crashes after a few minutes"" ""reviews"" popped up, and it's a much better game than to deserve failing due those, so here is my honest opinion after a but more than an hour.)

Update: It really starts to get much better in the 3rd era. It is now kind of democratic, you are elected and have to fight to stay in power. Your council is also elected, which makes it possible to attack your problems with them from different angles. 
For example in my last term I had a really hard time, I made some bad zoning decisions and the town was bleeding money. By the mayoral elections we were deeply in debt. To remedy this until the unused zones get back in shape I tried to raise taxes, but the freedom party and the communists always stopped it, also making them my mortal enemies by the time the mayoral elections arrived. 
I was going to lose it badly, but I had one chance, I had a lot of dirt on those two. The communists were easy, at the first sign of trouble they yielded and gave me full support. The Freedom Party on the other hand would rather have me out them, but refused to cooperate, so that's what happened. I had enough of the goodwill of the other parties to win the election by a very small margin. 
Then another term went by, the economy was still bad, but the communists started to like me as we agreed on a lot of proposals. I still couldn't raise taxes, and I didn't want to use my goodwill to do so as the mayoral elections looked like a disaster. Then came the elections for the council, and the Communist party won big time. The freedom party however was reduced to almost nothing due to all the bad stuff that were revealed during the last mayoral elections. This gave me majority support in the council, so I'm still in game, the taxes are raised, so the budget is recovering and population is rising again. 
It could still be more complicated, but it already strikes all the right chords with me.","Pretty good game, but not yet great. Only on my first playthrough, but it scratches a lot of the itches I have in gaming.

Oh top tip, don't install basic utilites like street lights. It will econimically ruin the empire and you'll have to ask the Emporer himself for more funds. For your lamps.

Wait for some patches and a price drop. This is a £15 game, not £35.

To clarify, the game feels shallow as the political mecahnics feel almost meaningless. They seem to simply serve as a difficulty barrier. For example, if you are economically struggling, you need to build industry. To build industry, you need to ask the council.

Council say no.

It then doesn't offer up any reason as to why, job creation doesn't float any political groups boat for some reason.

You then stare at the screen unsure of how to increase funds while the council do nothing. It's like the game NEEDS you to be hands on, but won't let you at the same time.

Also, researching technologies unlocks new types of buildings, clothes shops for example. Yet you have no way to place these as it's a hands off appraoch. Meaning you just have to assume there is a clothes shop some where in the city now.

Well after pver 44 hours played, the game plays well, and is fun. Gets very laggy late game with depth flowing to 32fps. Our system specs are below and are not outdated to say the least. It gets very demanding.
When tested on a top line quality laptop, same drop on fps. Seems to bog down greatly.
On an older laptop, its simply is horrible. If your laptop is not a quad core or better, with a near recent video card, forget it, you can play the first quater of the game and then just sit there and play thumb wars. LOL

OLD REVIEW BELOW BEFORE OUR ENDING REVIEW IS BELOW;

Looking at this game we figured that it would be boring, and be limited. We decided to give it a go because Kalypso's reputation with Tropico and other games and their huge amount of content and fun.
We are so glad we did!
The spin instead of being a city builder, your a Mayor. But not a Mayor on God Mode. You can not raise taxes, change things without going thru city council to start. Basically you have to lobby each area of govt. before voting.
While doing this you must maintain the city, your reputation to get re-elected, and keep the gorvening bodies and relations balanced or you will not get anything passed when improving your city. No improving your city means, no more you. Edicts, building, reasearch, so much to juggle like in real politics. Then add you pushing your views on what you feel your city will be and sell it to each council member.

EDIT; HOLY SH*T FIRE! Now the original parties in the game are splitting into more parties. SON OF A **TCH! Now the Emperor at 8 hours in is starting some crap with the govenor. The Govenor is a moron and wants my support. The Emperor has plans for me but he can not be trusted.
OUR CHOICE IS TO PUT OUR HEAD BETWEEN OUR LEGS AND KISS OUT A$$ GOODBYE!
This game just got real... and intense. WE LIKEY! COME TO DADDY!

EDIT; Got thru this and that... your spoiled... your fat... I like your kids... your kids should not be in public they are so ugly... and so on... but wow... this game just keeps getting better. In Hour 17 and well things have not dropped off one bit!

This game already has replayability in the plethora(many) choices in every area.
Research is not a grind, and instead of getting one thing for research you get bundles.

Heck, I want to slap some of these politicians, just now while writing this for pissing on my propsal to ban crapping in the streets. He must be the one that pissed on my shoes yesterday and thinks its funny to crap in the town hall park.
They are as stubborn as a mule some of the people and politicians while others are nice. Then you have the A-hole in every crowd, but he is your a-hole and friend when you really needed his support. 
But like in real life, peoples opinions change, with each decision, just depending how you covey that message and choose to side when they want to bring their own changes to your changes and you have to fight them. 

You can plea, bargain, threaten, or talk to the papers, behind closed doors, in a group or to the whole city council... ect ect. Just a ton of ways, like in life, to get the job done or undone.

EDIT; STILL NO OPTION TO BI**H SLAP! Damn.

It has been bug free for our first two hours. Still only have one district to manage, god help us trying to expand.

EDIT; Still bug and glitch free after 17 hours.

The tutorial is fantasic, we had to do it twice because we got a little impatient the first time and starting exploring on our own... don't do that! Go at their pace your first go. You will thank us later.

In closing;
This is a terrific spin on a city management/builder game. You don't build, you as to build. You don't bully or you get bullied. You can spend your own money to help the city for your passions. There is so much content, its gonna take many play thrus to get it down to any pattern which is ever changing.
Yes you read that right, CHANGING like the seasons so no run thru is alike. People change as they get older, you ban prositiution you may loose your male base and gain women favor. Allow alcohol and then you have the men back but now battered women or theft ect. 

You pick one faction, all having different benefits and cons, which all have different levels thru hisorical accurate development as you progress. We have yet to expand after two hours, because you can not rush.  IT is a chill and take your time game. The voting is intense and exciting. Especially if you really need XYZ and you pissed someone off last vote or recall on an edict. Heck we can not even get power because our finances took a hit building our first school, we raised taxes to pay for it and now people are throwing SH*T at us. Really... loads of it.... then I wanted to pass the No Pee In Public Ordiance. Naturally, they didnt agree because the city fun went up from SH*T tossing.

This is all we can provide so far in our first two hours.
EDIT; 8 HOURS IN. Wow.. just wow... if your impatient this game will add a new element. If your not in a hurry and can go with the swings... this game is immersive now.

Glitch and bug free so far, running at 61-64 FPS which is great with peak settings.

As stated prior still bug and glitch free after 17 hours.

Running NVidea Card 900 series with a Intel quad core.
1.1G Download on Solid State Drive
Game has run smooth in our first two hours without a hitch or bug.
Great Tutorial and Graphics thus far, and music is to each period which is nice and changes when the intesity of the situation changes. We really enjoy the political city hall forum and the feeling of being on Capital Hill.

Get the game, you will not regret it. 
They are also adding content as it was launched 1/20.
It is made by Kalypso, so you know your getting your money's worth.
The humor is in it, not just a challenge, just like in Tropico series and El Presidente. 
But your El Mayor-ente?... and you don't rule, you try to win the hearts and minds of your people.
You try to be political and enjoy that bs process of kissing babies and spanking their mommies while getting daddy's drunk to make a buck to build the school you need so you do not have a street full or ? running around.

We will add more once we get a few more hours in.
Funny, serious, challenging, and replay-able.
SOLID BUY! So glad we gave it a chance.

EDIT; 8 HOURS IN. Wow.. just wow... if your impatient this game will add a new element. If your not in a hurry and can go with the swings... this game is immersive now.

Glitch and bug free so far, running at 61-64 FPS which is great with peak settings.

As stated prior still bug and glitch free after 17 hours.

Running NVidea Card 900 series with a Intel quad core.
1.1G Download on Solid State Drive
Game has run smooth in our first two hours without a hitch or bug.
Great Tutorial and Graphics thus far, and music is to each period which is nice and changes when the intesity of the situation changes. We really enjoy the political city hall forum and the feeling of being on Capital Hill.

Get the game, you will not regret it. 
They are also adding content as it was launched 1/20.
It is made by Kalypso, so you know your getting your money's worth.
The humor is in it, not just a challenge, just like in Tropico series and El Presidente. 
But your El Mayor-ente?... and you don't rule, you try to win the hearts and minds of your people.
You try to be political and enjoy that bs process of kissing babies and spanking their mommies while getting daddy's drunk to make a buck to build the school you need so you do not have a street full or ? running around.

We will add more once we get a few more hours in.
Funny, serious, challenging, and replay-able.
SOLID BUY! So glad we gave it a chance.

Kidding aside, if you're into political games (aka Democracy 3 and Nation States) that involve choosing policies and seeing how your decisions shape the place you rule (and also you look forward to the political aspects of the game rather than the city building ones), I think that you would appreciate it. The unique thing that differenciates this game from the other titles I mentioned is that one, it provides an actual visual representation of that location rather than just text descriptions and two, it features a historical storyline (with the political decisions reflecting the time period).

Do not buy this game if you're looking for a city builder because that will just disappoint you since that is not the game's focus (considering the high price as well). If that's what you want, just get Cities Skylines and look for some Industrial Revolution themes/mods for your city.

Я довольно долго ждал эту игру, честно говоря, даже уже запланировал серию летсплеев по ней, так как люблю игры о политике, глобальные стратегии, строительство и экономику. Но данная игра не смогла заинтересовать, причем, увы совсем.
В ней просто нет изюминки, ты заходишь в игру и ты не знает что в ней делать, не потому, что не понятно, а потому что ты не понимаешь зачем делать те или иные действия, - в чем смысл? Обычно игра затягивает, появляется одна цель, затем пока идешь к ней, еще десяток, здесь же их нет вообще... 
На отсутствие интереса, так же накладывается крайне убогая цветовая гамма интерфеса, которая в принципе, подходит для оформления помещения детского сада, но ни как не для градоправительного симулятора, которым позиционируется эта игра.
Мелкие недочеты управления, я в расчет не беру, но они тоже не приятны. К примеру нельзя эскейпом закрыть диалоговое окно или регулирование скорости игры + и - на цифровой клавиатуре... почему не 1.2.3??? Почему надо снимать правую руку с мышки и переносить на клавиатуру? Но это все конечно придирки, а вот отстутвие интереса, - это уже важно... 
Строительства в игре нет от слова полностью, - растянуть район в котором автоматически создадутся дороги и распределятся районы, - это катило для 90х и 00х годов, но сейчас, как-то смешно...
Основное времяпровождение, это заседания совета, которые довольно однообразны и скучны.

Если хотите поиграть в игру данного жанра с куда большей проработкой, - поиграйте в игры серии Гильдия. Вот там вы действительно берете на себя роль главы династии, правда купцов, но с тем же успехом можете пойти и в политику, можете строить здания, ходить по городу, все проработано в мелочах и намного более грамотно. А это дешевая (не фигаш себе дешевая 600 рублей) поделка, а не игра... 

Это один из редких случаев, когда мнение об игре формируется еще в процессе обучения... и играть дальше, просто не хочется. Еще раз напомню, - я любитель данного жанра и за всеми парадоксовскими играми, скажем, насидел не одну тысячу часов. В общем я ставлю игре минус, возможно я ошибаюсь и она глубже и интереснее, но я не готов ставить свои деньги на кон и проверять дальше а потом не иметь возможности вернуть их... Можете рискнуть.

29381822,russian,2017.00.20 23:27,❌,✅,0.6202930212,8,"Мой первый обзор на это чудо геймдева был настолько восторженным, что в комментах начали подозревать о его проплаченности. И покуда Kalypso не спохватилась по поводу моих гонораров, я решил его спешно поправить. Описанные мною вещи имели некоторое отношение к реальности, но впечатления от первых 48 минут игры нельзя назвать релевантными. Особенно, если вся игра в эти 48 минут и вместилась. 

В предыдущем обзоре я упоминал о Tropico 5 и серии ""Затерянный Мир"". Это то, что сформировало моё видение сего многострадального жанра, ибо SimCity и серия Cities при всех их плюсах очень сильно похожи на симуляторы вкладок. 

Основой любого градостроительного симулятора является строительство зданий (капитан Очевидность врывается в тред). Да, строить приходится не только в играх этого жанра, и тактические стратегии, типа Казаков II, вполне бы пережили отсутствие этой опции. Но невозможно представить себе градостроительный симулятор без строительства. Похоже, это тот самый случай, когда с водой выплеснули ребёнка. 

Строительство происходит в форме зонирования территории -- как в SimCity. Каждый новый район будет равномерно распределён по зонам: жилой, коммерческой или промышленной. Впоследствии, изучив нужную технологию, можно будет редактировать уже построенный район, вручную задавая процент каждой из зон. Можно будет даже строить монорайоны -- сугубо жилые, коммерческие, etc. Но на этом всё. Да, есть специальные здания, типа городской ратуши, полицейского участка, школы, но их придётся втыкать в уже заданную сетку. Иногда это можно сделать сразу. Но как правило, новые здания доступны только после изучения соответствующей технологии, и втыкать их придётся на место уже существующей постройки жилого, коммерческого или производственного назначения. Причём, изменять район можно только через голосование в совете (что само по себе реалистично), однако совет вполне может вам отказать: какой европейский депутат (действие происходит в Австрии) под присягой даст добро на снос дома, если там живут его избиратели? Прокладка водопровода, газификация и прочие блага технологического прогресса также добавляются в окне изменения района после одобрения их плана в совете. Ярким минусом всего этого является то, что по большому счёту все эти изменения НЕ БУДУТ ВИДНЫ. Только расходы из бюджета увеличатся. 

Центральным элементом игры предстаёт городской совет. Чем-то он напоминает The Guild, только с партиями вместо NPC. Внутри него проходит голосование по вопросам, сводящимся к налоговому наполнению бюджета, строительству зданий и специальным ивентам. С партиями внутри совета можно взаимодействовать через просьбы или шантаж, дабы склонить их на свою сторону. Как только депутаты готовы голосовать -- игра сама заботливо встанет на паузу. И хотя их решения нельзя не заметить, их всё-таки достаточно сложно увидеть. Да, вовремя повысив налоги вы спасёте себя от дефицита бюджета. Но дефицит здесь случается довольно часто и его всё равно не избежать, а вот адекватных альтернативных моделей его преодоления в игру не завезли. Здесь вообще чувствуется недостаток альтернативных путей решения. Если симулятору латиноамериканского диктатора это можно было простить (хотя там альтернативы были), то вот в игре про работу ландрата (так эти учреждения назывались в реальности) это недопустимо и лишает её всякого смысла. 

Про дерево технологий плохого не скажу. Затея нехарактерна для игр подобного жанра, но само по себе это смотрится органично. Недостатки элементов развития не затронули конкретно этот механизм и, при прочих равных, даже его линейность не бросалась бы в глаза.

Мой первый вывод был достаточно мягким, а отзыв хвалебным. И поныне не могу назвать игру провалом, но и от своих славословий тоже отказываюсь. Помню свои ожидания и то, как их подогрели первые минуты после запуска. Даже сейчас я вижу в Urban Empire большой потенциал, который абсолютно не был реализован. 

Эпилог. После малоизвестного SimCity: Societies от каждого градостроительного симулятора я жду трёх вещей: 
1. Набережных. 
2. Кастомизации зданий. 
3. Ощущения смены эпох и влияния принятых решений (сходные, на самом деле, вещи). 
Пока что я дождался только набережных, и то в Cities: SkyLine. Urban Empire же в некотором роде разбила мне сердце тем, что явно ПООБЕЩАЛА второй и третий пункты, но совершенно их, имея к тому все возможности, не выполнила. 5,5 (одного расчленили мятежники) канцлеров Неттермихов из 10.",

Upd... Поиграв еще немного времени могу с уверенностью сказать... первое впечатление верное. Если и покупать, то только когда будут скидки. Есть, конечно и веселые моменты (Лама, подаренная от небезизвестного Пену....мо), но... все равно общее впечатление - скучновато.
 Интерфейс - неинформативен. Например - дали построитиь вокзал. Так его можно построить только в... определенном месте. А, поскольку, застраиваться я начал вдалеке от того места, то этот зеленый квадрат дааалеко не сразу увидел. И долго не мог понять, почему не дают построить.

-Aşağıda yazanlar oyun ilk çıktığında gelişeceğine olan inancımla pozitif olarak yazılmıştır. Gelişmedi.

Management/City Building oyunlarının hastasıyımdır. Bu yüzden bu oyunu bir süredir 
bekliyordum. Hatta hayatımda sadece 4 kere pre-purchase oyun almış birisi olmama rağmen bu oyuna güvenip aldım. Peki bu kadar beklentiye değdi mi? 

İlk olarak oyunun ana detaylarından bahsetmek gerek; 

[b]Teknoloji:[/b]
Oyunda 5 Çağdan oluşan bir teknoloji ağacı bulunuyor. Her çağda 8~20 kadar teknoloji var. Bazı teknolojiler karar, bazıları upgrade, bazıları yeni yapıları açıyor.

[b]Building:[/b]
Standart city building game mantığıyla belli bir bölgeyi seçip inşaa izni veriyorsunuz. Yine 3 çeşit demand bulunmakta. Residential, commercial ve industrial. Bölgeyi seçerken bunların % lerini ayarlıyoruz. Hizmetler ise yine oldukça bilindik klinik, okul, kilise(cami koyun cami) vb. gibi şeyler. Sonradan birşeyler eklemek isterseniz bölgeyi düzenleyebiliyorsunuz ki büyük ihtimalle isteyeceksiniz çünkü araştırdığınız teknolojilerde su boruları, sokak lambaları gibi şeylerde var.

[b]Yönetim:[/b]
Oyunda 4 farklı aile var. Her ailenin farklı bir özelliği var. Class gibi düşünebiliriz. Başlangıçta birini seçip oyunu o aile üzerinden oynuyoruz. Daha önemlisi oyunda oylama sistemi var. Oluşturduğunuz her bölge, her hizmet binası, her bölge düzenlemesi, aldığınız her karar yapılmadan önce oylamaya sunuluyor. Eğer çoğunluğu alırsanız eyleminiz gerçekleşiyor. Oyları verenler ise meclis diyebileceğimiz yerdeki partilerin sahip olduğu meclis üyesi diyebileyeceğimiz şahıslar. Her partinin görüşü farklı olduğu için çoğunlukla aralarından karşı çıkanlar oluyor. Kararlarını değiştirmek için konuşabilir tehdit edebilir veya zor kullanabilirsiniz. Karar değiştirtmenin genelde kötü etkisi/etkileri oluyor. Dengeli ve dikkatli kullanmak lazım.


Genel olarak oyun hakkındaki görüşüm ise çok güzel olduğu yönde. Diğer incelemelere bakınca insanlar bu oyundan çok daha farklı şeyler beklemişler. Ama oyun duyrulduğu günden beri ne dediyse o özelliklere sahip. Ne fazlası ne azı. Bahsedemediğim pek çok detay var fakat bir strateji oyununu anlatmak için bir inceleme yeterli olmaz. Ana hatlarıyla bundan ibaret. Oy sistemine ve şehrinizi geliştirmeye odaklı politik bir oyun. Zorluk olarak biraz kolay geldi ama bir çeşit sandbox oyun sonuçta pek takmamak lazım. Her ne kadar namı değer ""Kalypso Media Digital"" DLC ile ekleriz diyip çoğu şeyi es geçmiş olsada oyun kendini saatlerce oynatır. 

[u]Artılar:[/u]
- Strateji ögelerini çok güzel harmanlanmış
- Çeşitli teknoloji
- Bir strateji oyununa göre güzel görsellik
- Akıcı oynanış

[u]Eksiler:[/u]
- Sanki biraz kolay
- Brace yourself DLCs are coming
- Random Event'lerde seçeneklerin sonuçlarını ancak seçtikten sonra görebiliyoruz. Kişiye göre değişir ama bana göre kötü bir özellik.

[10 saat Güncellemesi]:
-Oyunun tekrar oynanabilirliği çok düşük.
-Oyunun ilerisinde geliştirmeleri yapmak oldukça zor.
-Meclis sadece olsun diye var. Çoğu kararı istediğim gibi kabul ettirebiliyorum.

Pros:

- Good concept

Cons:

- The UI is a mess and far from being intuitive. For example, when you are going to put a Townhall, the big button to confirm does nothing. You have to guess that you should click in a tiny button to enable you to place the damn hall.

- The Ui is horrible really.

- The game do not have font configs so, if you does not have a sniper's sight, you will have a bad time. ( Obs: i have a 42' pol monitor )

- The price is too high for it, totally.

不过------------------------------

昨天就是等到两点下载挂机刷了个好评, 今天认真玩到第三世代, 并且赢得了第一次市长选举.
那么你要问这游戏怎么样? 说实话, 这就是个宣传民主的历史教育游戏. 而且只有页游的水平
这游戏目前的难度可以说是太简单了, 以至于我在游戏的前两个世代几乎都没有干涉过任何政党, 所有投票都是通过的. 
整个游戏过程是都是重复的点点点, 枯燥无味. 游戏没有自由沙盒模式. 所以几乎没有重复游玩的欲望, 我可能只会打通一遍就不会再玩了. 
游戏性可能需要多个DLC来改进增强了. 
目前看来这游戏是不推荐购买的, 但好评还是要给的. 就冲着我最上面说的那句话!



----------------------今天总算完成了五个世代, 再编辑一次吧

依然是不推荐这个游戏, 因为后期真的都是枯燥无味的重复点点点
在经济发展良好的情况下, 各个政党很容易就通过所谓""政治正确""的提案.
因此几乎不会用到任何手段来操作选票, 以至于和各政党的关系都处于""非常良好""的位置
所以市长选举时也都会投给我, 简直不要太简单.
连给我加薪到最高的提案都是五十多票压倒性通过的.

这游戏就像我之前说的, 感觉就是个帮助大家认识西方的民主和多党制, 以及了解""他们""近200多年的发展历史. 但由于游戏设置得太简单, 导致许多政策和发明都早于实际年代出现.

我个人早就深受民主主义的洗礼, 所以玩起来还算都能理解. 
但里面有一点很让我惊讶, 那就是为什么游戏里的共产党是赞成分级制度的?!

先來說說我第一次的玩法:

幸福成度 => 滿足成度
滿足成度 => 完善設施
完善設施 => 充足資金

一撇言之, 收稅!

開始先說服大家提高稅率直到所有黨派對你不滿為止
(我個人是提高稅率至 工商25% 人民30%)

然後繼續發起提案:
降低工商稅率並提高人民稅率直到你城市的總收入降低一些為止
黨派們看到總收入減少後都是很樂意投贊成票

之後繼續循環提高人民稅率直到95%
(工商稅率會一直降, 我是降至17%)

雖然短時間內總收入變少, 但是人民的收入卻是會慢慢增漲

資金也跟著變充足, 就可以開始造各種設施來滿足人民需求

事件? 全部都選最貴最好的選項也根本不是事!

要求減稅? 每次提案也都只減1~3%, 根本不痛不癢!

市長個人資金? 要求提高市長薪水各黨派也幾乎全數同意!

如果遊戲公司不改變一些玩法上的限制, 那的確......

故事性 ★★★☆☆ (事件和選項足夠多, 但依然不夠豐富; 期待之後更新補充)
畫質 ★★☆☆☆ (可圈可點, 特別是垂直同步無法正確啟用)
背景音樂 ★★☆☆☆ (略顯單調)
腳色 ★★★☆☆ (足夠有趣, 但可惜不能直接挑選不同時代人物或者自創)
介面熟悉 ★★☆☆☆ (有待優化, 特別是教學部分)
耐玩度 ★★☆☆☆ (很快就上隱也很快就膩)
遊戲上手 ★★★★☆ (挺容易讓人理解)

整體 ★★★☆☆ 3/5 (包括價格部分在內, 值得推薦好友一玩, 但不適合買來送禮)

Although the general mechanics play out the same each time, a large variety of events make each game slightly different. The main difference between Urban Empire and more traditional city builders is that most everything is put to a vote, so politics and relationships with parties matter. Districts are placed with zoning layouts, services, and infrastructure support. The city council must approve new districts through a vote; they also will vote on tax rate changes, modifications to existing districts, edicts, and service funding levels. Goodwill can be spent persuading parties to vote your way. A research tree contains inventions that unlock new services and edicts. Citizens have needs in several areas (such as social life, environment, health, and fun) that can be fulfilled by placing services. Urban Empire is a challenging game: it is difficult to consistently turn a monthly profit and still satisfy the needs of the citizens, and getting votes passed requires balance and skill.
