A movimentação que para mim é o ponto forte a ponto de sempre querer me mexer pelo board o tempo todo. Os gráficos estão ótimos e muito bem feitos, isso vale para os VFX's e toda a trilha sonora que da um PLUS em toda a experiencia.

Pontos Positivos:
1 - Movimentação prazerosa.
2 - Gráficos muito bem feitos.
3 - Trilha sonora Exepcional.
4 - Ilustrações lindas.
5 - VFX bem feitos.

Pontos a se melhorar:
1 - O boss ter apenas um tipo de ataque é meio anti climax, toda a dificuldade do level final são os outros desafios o boss não trás perigo nenhum para fase, sendo facilmente de desviar dele.
2 - A animação do boss poderia ser um pouco mais fluida.
3 - A entrada do boss poderia ser um pouco mais impactante.
4 - O texto com os objetivos antes de começar a fase tem uma menor se comparada com os de dentro da fase.

Ponto negativo:
1 - A voz que fala ""go"", ""mission failed"" tem uma qualidade muito inferior se comparada com o resto do jogo.

O jogo está muito bem feito e entrega completamente tudo oque é prometido, super recomendo.
","I just finished the story mode and found the game overall very interesting. For me, the movement is its strong point, making me want to move around the board all the time. The graphics are excellent and very well done, as are the VFX and the soundtrack, which adds a plus to the entire experience.

Positive Points:
1 - Pleasant movement.
2 - Very well-done graphics.
3 - Exceptional soundtrack.
4 - Beautiful illustrations.
5 - Well-done VFX.

Points for improvement:
1 - The boss having only one type of attack is a bit of an anticlimax. The final level's difficulty lies in the other challenges. The boss poses no threat to the stage and is easily dodged.
2 - The boss's animation could be a little more fluid.
3 - The boss's entrance could be a little more impactful. 4 - The text with objectives before starting the level is shorter compared to the text within the level.

Negative points:
1 - The voice that says ""go"" or ""mission failed"" is of much lower quality compared to the rest of the game.

The game is very well made and completely delivers on its promises. I highly recommend it."

Some things made the story mode too hard.

Level 2 has very little time for the 50 stars needed to complete. If you take your time and play safe, you won't have enough time to finish the level.

Level 5 is pretty cool, the big monster is really cool looking. The only thing was that sometimes the stars spawn in his area, and it is impossible to complete combos, could have a detection on where the stars are spawning to prevent it.

Other than that, had a lot of fun, used all my breaks at work to play and finish the story mode.

Level 3 with the UFO is pretty cool, and really gets you moving if you weren't already.
