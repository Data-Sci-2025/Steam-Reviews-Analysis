Abandoned and gutted before its time. I got this in a bundle of Double Fine games and felt that I at least had to try it out to see if the overwhelmingly negative score was corrected, and yea, it totally deserves it.. Ironically enough, Tim Schafer has some absolute bangers in his hall of fame with Monkey Island, Psychonauts and Day of the Tentacle to name some of the most prolific, and then there are the likes of Hack N Slash and Spacebase DF-9. Sure, this is the work of Double Fine which one could argue is a whole different company from his earlier works, but still, one starts to wonder how it could go so completely sideways. 

This game is centered around building and building a spacebase (no surprise there) while gathering an oddball crew of workers to populate it and raid mysterious space hulks in the vicinity. This sounds great on paper, but the game is janky, broken and most importantly unfinished and if it were not for the great work of the community putting out patch after patch to polish it up to a decent standard this would be a complete waste of space in my library. 

[b]Conclusion:[/b]Avoid and do not bother, there are far better games out there for this price. The fact that this game is still available to buy for 10€ is a scam, in my humble opinion. Somewhere in its DNA is the glimmer of a great game that never manifested itself, and instead we get an infested scrapcode filled with the broken dreams of all those who were left behind..

The world is missing. The team is blocked. Because of Kai's round flower killing test, the provincial art is followed by thousands.

The song of the strong power is said to be balanced. The empty finger points to the shooting. The shape of the material is magnetic. The land is repaired. The history of Sichuan is long and lively. This chapter of the cotton and vegetable can be recorded.

[h2]Resumen[/h2]
Bienvenidos a mi reseña de \Spacebase DF-9\, el juego que prometió llevarte a las estrellas pero te dejó flotando en el vacío. Es como comprar un boleto para un crucero espacial y terminar en un bote inflable con un agujero.

[h2]Aspectos importantes e interesantes[/h2]
Lo más destacable de \Spacebase DF-9\ es la premisa de construir y gestionar tu propia estación espacial. ¡Genial, verdad? Suena como el sueño de todo fanático de la ciencia ficción, hasta que te das cuenta de que ese sueño viene con una factura de realidades no tan agradables.

[h2]Aspectos por mejorar[/h2]
Ay, amigos, la lista es larga. Desde la gestión de recursos que te hace sentir más como un contable en apuros, hasta una interfaz que parece diseñada por extraterrestres (y no de los inteligentes). Además, la IA de los ocupantes es como hablarle a una pared. A veces, literal.

[h2]Summary[/h2]
Welcome to my review of Spacebase DF-9, the game that promised to take you to the stars but left you floating in the void. It's like buying a ticket for a space cruise and ending up on an inflatable boat with a hole in it.

[h2]Important and Interesting Aspects[/h2]
The highlight of Spacebase DF-9 is the premise of building and managing your own space station. Great, right? Sounds like every sci-fi fan's dream, until you realize that dream comes with a price tag of not-so-pleasant realities.

[h2]Aspects for Improvement[/h2]
Oh, friends, the list is long. From resource management that makes you feel more like a struggling accountant, to an interface that looks like it was designed by aliens (and not the intelligent ones). Plus, occupant AI is like talking to a wall. Sometimes literally.

[h3]Final Evaluation[/h3]
If your total scores are less than [b]50[/b]: [i]Don't buy it[/i].

There you have it, Spacebase DF-9, the game that's more of a challenge to your patience than your skill as a player. My suggestion? Spend that money on something more rewarding, like a large pizza to enjoy while you choose another game."

This game has design/implementation defects that will render this unplayable for many gamers.  The game was abandoned by Double Fine in an incomplete state, yet, unethically, they continue to try scam gamers into buying a product they know is defective, unfinished and unplayable..[/quote]

Spacebase DF-9 is an extremely promising looking sci-fi base building/strategy game... and there's a huge market for such games if done right, which this isn't.  In fact this is a cautionary tale about not judging a book by it's cover... and while the traditional meaning of that is we shouldn't dismiss a book just because it looks bad, when it comes to video games, it's the opposite.  Some video games may look really fantastic but turn out to be duds... especially when they're not even complete games.

How did it come to this?

The core problem here is that this isn't a sincerely made, professional game, it's a Game Jam/demo project.  Game Jam and other student/project games are not made for gamers, they're made for the benefit of stroking the ego of developers.  It's obviously not possible for a game slapped together over a few days to be of the same quality as a properly, sincerely made game from a full development team with a full budget who take the right amount of time and put in genuine hard work to create a product for gamers.  Sure, it is possible to slap together a game in such a manner, unprofessionally.  This is a lot like driving a car using only your feet.  Just because it can be done, doesn't mean it's a good idea, and often ends up in disaster.

After the game jam, Double Fine made a commitment to finish the game... then didn't bother, they just abandoned it.  They took all the money from gamers based on this promise, abandoned the game, and kept all the cash they scammed out of gamers.  Completely reprehensible. 

Reviewing SteamDB to check how popular this game was with players reveals a surprise... there's a very healthy spike in player counts for the game.  How is this possible, if the game is incomplete and unplayable?  This only happened once, around the same time that trading cards were applied to the game... so this is just card idlers getting their cards and moving on.  A closer look at the numbers shows the game just has a couple of players every week running up the game and idling it for cards, then deleting it.  We must ask how it benefits gamers for there to be so many games like this, with no merit as a serious game, that only generate sales from people idling and selling the trading cards.

The developer is deliberately and unethically trying to scam gamers into paying them the greedy, cash grab price of $10 USD for a game they know is broken.  Don't give it to them.  This is also competing with over 9,000 free games available on Steam, many of them far better than this paid product.

155547129,english,2024.00.08 15:11,❌,✅,0.5836141109,20,"This game is made by doublefine. Why is that important? Well the leader of that company (Or former leader if he's already been fired by now, I have no idea) is a man named Tim Schafer. Apparently he was there when games like monkey island and grim fandango were made. I've heard they are great and were absolute classics.
So what is the issue then and why have I brought this up in the first place?

Well the studio he was in charge of by the name of ""Doublefine"" had a period I like to call the ""Indie phase"" where they hosted game jams and picked the best games out of the ones on display to be made into fully fledged games. One of the games they picked came out somewhat half baked. It was called ""Broken age"" and was forced to launch with only half of the game playable, so the studio could make enough money off the sales to create the second half of the game and add that. 
This might not seem so bad until you realise that the company had made a kickstarter for that game and promised the backers a full and ready game if they backed it. So understandably many backers were upset about this.

But Broken age wasn't the game that got the rawest deal. That was this game Spacebase DF-9. While I didn't back it on its kickstarter (Yes there was a kickstarter for this game too) I did buy it in early access. Now thankfully the game is playable.
Its a quirky yet fun space colony management sim where you get to make choices that effect your colony now and then.

But there is a glaring flaw here and it is the reason I cannot recommend the game. Because the whole project was dropped like a hot potato, there is a point in the game where the progression and content grinds to a halt. And I don't mean you get drip fed more content, I'm talking about walking into a fully fledged brick wall.

Your colonies/bases will be doomed eventually because of this. They may thrive, they might become sprawling megacentres that act as a refuge for humanity. But eventually they will wither and die due to enough natural space born disasters popping up and screwing the place over. I also encountered a game breaking scripting error once.
I was constantly choosing a dialogue option that sent attacking forces of pirate raiders away, and all of a sudden, something gave way in the code. 

Every single pirate raider I had convinced to leave my colony alone came swarming in like a bunch of army ants. That save file stood no chance. Everyone died horribly. 
In the end I'm sorry if my review made you upset, because to be honest I was getting upset while writing this. This game could have been great, but its been left behind.


Please, don't buy this game. Its not worth it in the end. 
Also for my final note I wouldn't recommend buying anything else from double fine either considering their track record. Except psychonaughts 2. I heard that is a really good game.

Anyway, that is everything I had to say.","This game is made by doublefine. Why is that important?

2. lack of depth: the game does not offer much depth when it comes to long-term strategic decisions, which can make the game monotonous and superficial.

3. incomplete gameplay: the game still has many bugs and missing features, which is understandable especially for an early access game, but can still frustrate.

This game... man... For those who actually bought it; I feel bad for you! Really, I do! I'll tell you a bit about the premise, if you're still interested in the worst game ever on Steam lol
You're on a spaceship, and simulating a situation where you're supposed to survive! You get settlers in the ship, that can build, do multiple mundane activities but not all at once! You gotta select them individually and put them to a task... Now, the game starts off by saying that ""your settlers will die without an Oxygen tank, set one of them to build it"", so after telling you absolutly nothing in the tutorial, you actually find the Oxygen Tank and you build it... Keeping up with the tutorial's checklist, doing what is asked of you... and you think you're getting somewhere; so you speed up time to get stuff done faster, your settlers start now moving and working at a reasonable pace... Two minutes in, and then they all get seizures and die Hahaha! I actually laughed at that, really hard. They just are like ""Nope, enough work, I amma just die now"". The failure message states that ""Your ship has ran out of Oxygen""... Umm, Okay! So I decide to give it another go and go slow this time... The settlers all die again at the exact time all at once and the message persists despite my monitor displaying that I've got 72% Oxygen on that crappy shit.

The beginning half of the game feels great but as you play you encounter more and more issues that make it impossible to play. Combat is the most broken, impossible system I have ever seen in any simulation game, ever. Let's talk about some issues:

-Derelicts (ships that spawn with loot / enemies) if you explore them, you're almost guaranteed to have a crewmate get stuck there and slowly suffocate and starve. Since you can't directly control anyone, the only way to save them to to build a path from the derelict to your ship. Also, it is functionally impossible to order your crew to fully explore a Derelict. They just won't do it.
-Incapacited crew/raiders can stay that way for so long that they'll literally starve to death. Additionally, enemies can just stand up and be completely fine afterward and go on a rampage, so if a raider goes down but doesn't die, you have to deploy security for them for weeks at a time.
-You can get pop-ups for events / problems that have been solved. These pop-ups never go away and will eventually open back up no matter what.
-I've lost several new games simply because my crew won't go inside and refill their oxygen. This has a risk of happening with every new game.
-Raiders can be ridiculously strong, able to kill (with only one raider) over 15 crew without being downed. Even if your entire crew is security you'll probably die to what is effectively a bad rng roll.
-Corpses never go away. The community patch fixes this but parasite corpses aren't removed.
-If one of your crew dies on a derelict, your crew will all automatically go to try to loot their body. If the derelict isn't empty of enemies, this means that your entire crew will eventually die trying to get loot. There is no way to stop them from doing this. 
-There's not prioritization of tasks. Even if your crew is literally dying and need to act immediately, they'll still stop to chat and ask people their favorite bands.
-Wounded crewmates will continue doing harmful tasks even to certain death. You can order them to go to the infirmary, but they don't listen and will die anyway.
-In the community patch, meteors will hit parts of your station. You get a warning and opportunity to avoid it, but you can't order your crew to move away so it's really just a random 'these crew members die' event. The game is FULL of these.
-Music just sometimes stops playing completely until you go into the menu and turn it up.
-Practically speaking, it's near impossible to catch illnesses and there's literally nothing you can do to change the result besides employing more doctors, so this event also serves as a 'these crew members die' random pop-up. The base game also has way too many random diseases to look out for, and each of them needs to be researched to effectively stop them, and research takes nearly 10 hours of real time per disease. This is faster with more researchers but everyone in this game just dies randomly with no ability to stop it.


Basically, this game is an embarrassment and is not really a game in its current state. It is an RNG button with some slight amount of interactivity but gives you so little control and has so little content that appears so often that functionally, the only thing you actually control in this game is heavily repeated dialogue that determines how many crew members you hire once every 2-5 minutes. Since your entire crew is likely to die about every 5 minutes, really these dialogues don't represent a choice at all, since you have to hire more to keep playing the game. In other words, this is a management sim where in reality, you are a passive participant that is watching events as they transpire.

This isn't a finished product, it's barely a game. It shouldn't be on sale at this point.","Sorry to say but this game just isn't finished and never will be.

우주선을 확장하고 새로운 크루들을 받아들이면서
적들의 침공을 막아 생존하는 게임입니다.

초기에는 기본적인 엔진과 3명의 승무원만으로 시작하며,
기본적인 생존을 위한 바닥과 벽, 그리고 산소 생성기 등을 건설하고
우주 밖으로 오고갈 수 있는 슈트거치대와 특수문을 설치합니다.

어느정도 모양이 갖추어지면 승무원들에게 보다 다양한 직업들을 지정할 수 있습니다.
지시하는 건물이나 가구 등을 제작하여 배치하는 건설, 
우주 공간에 존재하는 자원 광석들을 채집해오는 광부, 
적들의 침공에 맞서는 경비와 부상당한 이들과 시체를 처리하는 의사,
외에도 기술의 개발과 농사를 짓는 직업, 식음료를 담당하는 직업도 존재하죠.
각 직업에 대한 선호도가 존재하며 해당 직업을 오래할수록 숙련도도 올라가게 됩니다.

룸을 건설한 뒤 해당 룸에 설치되는 물품에 의해서 룸의 특성이 결정됩니다.
에너지실일수도 있고 광석을 처리하는 곳, 운동, 잠자는 곳 등으로 지정되며
만약 이 룸을 다른 특성으로 변경하고 싶다면 설치된 물품들을 제거한 뒤
미지정 또는 다른 특성으로 변경을 하면 되죠.

가끔 합류하고 싶다는 이들이 찾아오는 경우도 있으며 산소 생성기가 적당하게 남아있다면
이들을 받아들이면서 점점 우주선을 확장해나가는 재미도 있습니다.
물론, 요러헥 안전하기만 한 것은 아니고 우주 도적단들이 등장하여
우주선에 침공해 승무원들을 공격하고 가구들을 파괴하는 경우도 있으며
외계 생명체라거나 운석등이 떨어지는 위험한 상황이 발생하기도 하죠.
적절하게 방비를 하고 있다면 이를 쉽게 막을 수 있지만 그렇지 않다면....

-건설하고 직업 지정 외에는 딱히 할게 없음","Spaceship Game

Expand your spaceship, recruit new crew members, and survive enemy invasions.

You start with only a basic engine and three crew members.

You build floors, walls, and oxygen generators for basic survival.

You then install chute racks and special doors to allow access to outer space.

Once your spaceship is fully developed, you can assign your crew members to various occupations.

Constructionists build and place buildings and furniture as instructed.

Miners gather ores from space.

Guardians defend against enemy invasions and doctors treat the wounded and the dead.

Furthermore, there are occupations that develop technology, farm, and handle food and beverages.

Each occupation has its own preferences, and the longer you play, the more proficiency you gain in that occupation.

After constructing a room, the items installed in it determine its characteristics. It can be designated as an energy room, or a place to process ore, exercise, or sleep.
If you want to change this room's characteristics, you can remove the installed items and change it to Unspecified or another characteristic.

Occasionally, people will come looking for new recruits. If you have enough oxygen generators left, you can welcome them and gradually expand your spaceship.
Of course, it's not always safe. Space thieves can invade your spaceship, attacking the crew and destroying furniture.
Also, dangerous situations like alien lifeforms or falling meteors can occur.
With proper defenses, these can be easily prevented, but without...

Disappointing Points
- Not very convenient
- Not many items can be installed
- Based on reviews, the battle record seems quite impressive (though it's not bad for a quick kill, so I recommend it)
- Nothing much to do other than build and assign a job."

The worst gameplay mechanic that other games got right 17+ years before this game was in Alpha is people assignments. Here you have to assign each person to a job. The bigger the base, the more people and jobs. The game doesn't tell you if a job needs filled, you have to search for one.

The rate of decay on equipment is intolerable. If this was real life, most equipment takes over a year to breakdown through constant use. In the game, things breakdown within 2 game days.

I looked at the store, it was $10 and mostly negative due to being released unfinished and abandoned.

This plan was (I suspect) so they as a newer studio would be able to move on to other games and not be bogged down on an endless development cycle with a single game.  

How is this game?  It is (imo) 100% an unfinished Spacebase Startopoia.  It has a very similar feel and honestly doesn't look that old.

You'll get endless waves of pirates and derelicts until everyone dies, and you'll have builders brick themselves off into rooms and suffocate if you don't watch their every step.

Not only that, it even got greenlighted to be made into a full game. So far so good. The game went into Steam Early Access, which is something I am always skeptical about, but as long as the game eventually gets fully released, I don’t really mind. But suddenly, the developers pulled the plug, and magically the game was finished and out of Early Access. What sorcery was this? Obviously, the game was still unfinished, with some crap responses from the publisher. To make matters worse, they released the source code, a middle finger saying that the community can and should finish the job.
Now, to be fair, it’s a sad story, but in the end what matters is the game itself right? Well, it’s a space management title, a genre I’m not really a fan of. But alright. The game starts with you picking a location to build a base, which basically acts as a difficulty select screen. Ok. It even has a special one designed to be a tutorial. Ok. Let’s try the tutorial then. I managed to complete it, and immediately saw how clunky it is to play. Navigation between menus is a mess and time consuming. After the tutorial things get worse. Plenty of times the crew members just ignore your orders or take forever to do anything. At this point I almost gave up on the game, but there is an unofficial community patch that essentially fixes a lot of bugs and adds some more features.
That patch is the supposed community salvation for the game, but even that one seems abandoned. Still, props for the people that spent time trying to fix and finish this mess of a game. Truth be said that patch really improves the overall experience, and I managed to play some playthroughs for a few hours this time. Unfortunately, the crappy foundation is still there, and it’s just a meh game. In the end, I just cannot recommend this: official release is unfinished, crappy publisher decision and PR, and even the community can’t save this disaster. While it is playable with the unofficial patch, I still didn’t like Spacebase DF-9.

I had a few hours of fun with it. It tries to capture the charme of a game made 30 years ago and in some parts this works very well. There are enough little details and animations so the space station feels alive. Events like appearing spaceships and raiders are a fun at first but become repetitive after just 5h of gameplay. 

Sadly you can tell the game was never finished. I thought i was playing another Gamejam project and i thought wow this is quite impressive :). 

For example even the most basic stuff like building a room can be quite annoying and complicated. Citizens don't react to enemy fire while in space and the needed defensive turrets can only be placed facing north and east while the attack came from south. Sometimes weird and fun stuff happens but no gamebreaking bugs yet...

After choosing a location on the map your 3 crewmen spawn near your pod, the game doesn't try at all to tell you what to do and your oxygen is slowly decreasing over time. If you somehow figure out what your doing and somehow build an airlock and a life support, your might run into a problem like I had where one of my crewmen refused to get into the station. 

This game has probably the worst camera angle ever. It becomes hard to place objects smartly when everything is covered up by something else. A basebuilding game shouldn't have the same camera as fallout 1 and 2.  

After your colony gets started you will start to get messages from NPCs asking to join your colony, While other basebuilding games like rimworld and ONI will allow to look at the traits of a colonist before they join you, Space Base just lets you see that NPC's gross face. 

Sometimes a derelict ship will appear some where on the map. If you send a security team to explore the ship and there is a hostile alien on board, most of the time the security team will not do anything and just stand there as they get killed. This is as far I've gotten in this shit game. 

In conclusion Spacebase DF-9 is a hyper shitty game and a waste of $10, It is probably smarter to get 10 copies of save Jesus, because then you might get some enjoyment out of your friends reactions when they see a gift of save Jesus.

Sometimes a derelict ship will appear some where on the map. If you send a security team to explore the ship and there is a hostile alien on board, most of the time the security team will not do anything and just stand there as they get killed. This is as far I've gotten in this shit game. 

In conclusion Spacebase DF-9 is a hyper shitty game and a waste of $10, It is probably smarter to get 10 copies of save Jesus, because then you might get some enjoyment out of your friends reactions when they see a gift of save Jesus.

Was soll man sagen... Double Fine ist eigentlich ein Studio mit guten Ruf bei mir aber dieses Spiel zu verkaufen, grenzt wort wörtlich an Betrug. Ich meine, ein Blick in die Reviews genügt, um zu sehen das hier etwas nicht stimmen kann. Wie kann ich einen Early Access Titel kommerziell vertreiben und dann einfach sagen 

""Sorry Jungs und Mädels, wir haben keinen Bock mehr aber schön das wir eure Kohle bekommen haben! Wir machen jetzt lieber was anderes!""

Was mich aber noch viel mehr daran stört, ist die Tatsache, daß dieses ""Spiel"" bis heute im Store von Steam gelistet wird und weiterhin Geld abwirft für den Entwickler. Ich kann nur jedem Empfehlen die Report-Funktion zu verwenden und dieses Game als Betrug zu melden wegen dem eingestellten Support in einem desolaten Zustand.

Double Fine Productions ist damit offiziell auf meiner schwarzen Liste für Publisher gelandet und ich werde zumindest legal keine weitere Software dieser Betrüger mehr erwerben. Schade aber ""bescheiß mich einmal, Schande über dich - bescheiß mich zweimal, Schande über mich"". Mein Motto und ich gebe so einer Firma bestimmt keine weitere Gelegenheit mehr, für so eine Aktion mein hart verdientes Bares abzugreifen.","!!! SCAM - FRAUD - DON'T BUY - REPORT !!!

What can I say... Double Fine is actually a studio with a good reputation in my opinion, but selling this game literally borders on fraud. I mean, one look at the reviews is enough to see that something can't be right here. How can I distribute an Early Access title commercially and then just say

""Sorry, guys and girls, we're fed up, but we're glad we got your money! We'd rather do something else!""

What bothers me even more, however, is the fact that this ""game"" is still listed in the Steam store today and continues to generate revenue for the developer. I can only recommend everyone to use the report function and report this game as a scam due to the discontinued support in such a desolate state.

Double Fine Productions has officially landed on my publisher blacklist, and I will, at least legally, no longer purchase any more software from these scammers. It's a shame, but ""scam me once, shame on you - scam me twice, shame on me."" That's my motto, and I will definitely not give such a company another opportunity to take my hard-earned cash for such a scheme."

come gioco vedo del potenziale anche se alla lunga resta un po monotono quando arrivi ad avere circa 20/30 forme di vita all'interno praticamente la sfida inizia per non farle morire nei più disparati modi dal morire bruciato per un incendio o faserizzati per colpa di un assalto(raid) dall'esterno perdendo tutte le fatiche fatte 

ultimamente sto provando una MOD non ufficiale la 1.08.1 e ho notato qualche problema quando appare un derelitto le forme di vita si spostano senza motivo e in caso di equipaggio ostile muoiono praticamente tutte il bello è che come al solito succede nei migliori film se crei una squadra di difesa attaccano uno alla volta andando in panico e morendo inutilmente 10 contro 1 ovvio che 1 vince sempre armato di tagliaunghie!!!! 

ci sono delle ricerche da far svolgere all'equipaggio nella versione base non sono molte e alcune non molto utili e il problema è l'ossigeno quando si arriva ad una certa quantità di forme di vita non basta assolutamente anche aumentando i vari produttori di ossigeno e ho trovato utile aumentare la grandezza della stanza ma ad un certo punto avere una stanza 60x60 solo per non far finire l'ossigeno immediatamente e non esistono ricerche al riguardo solo produttore maggiore per avere più equipaggio 

nella versione non ufficiale hanno aggiunto jukebox per il pub ricerche per ossigeno extra pupazzi per aumentare la felicità degli umanoidi varie piante e qualche accortezza per migliorare l'aspetto del gioco ma come ripeto la sezione militare ne risente un po 

per quanto mi riguarda il gioco non mi dispiace anche se poco seguito e aggiornato 
non lo coniglio per un gioco primario di tutti i giorni ma come passatempo
tra pregi e difetti sono più i difetti che i pregi quindi per il momento è no

As a game, I see potential, although it gets a bit monotonous after a while. Once you get to about 20-30 lifeforms inside, the challenge begins: keeping them from dying in various ways, from being burned in a fire to being phased by an external attack (raid), thus losing all your hard work.

Lately, I've been trying an unofficial MOD, 1.08.1, and I've noticed some problems. When a derelict appears, the lifeforms move around for no reason, and if there's a hostile crew, practically all of them die. The best part is that, as usual in the best movies, if you create a defense team, they attack one at a time, panicking and dying pointlessly. 10 against 1, of course, one always wins, armed with nail clippers!

There are some research items for the crew to complete in the basic version, but they aren't very many, and some aren't very useful. The problem is that when you reach a certain number of life forms, oxygen is simply not enough, even by increasing the various oxygen producers. I found it useful to increase the size of the room, but at a certain point, having a 60x60 room is just to avoid running out of oxygen immediately. There's no research on this, only a larger producer to have more crew.

In the unofficial version, they've added a jukebox for the pub, research for extra oxygen, puppets to increase the happiness of the humanoids, various plants, and a few tweaks to improve the look of the game, but as I repeat, the military section suffers a bit.

As far as I'm concerned, I don't dislike the game, even if it's not well-followed and updated.
I wouldn't recommend it as a primary everyday game, but as a pastime.
Between its strengths and weaknesses, the weaknesses outweigh the strengths, so for now, it's a no.

But I always leave the choice to you to buy it, perhaps encouraging the developers to update and improve this new gaming experience."

There ARE some user patches after 1.06 at spacebasehub.net, but I just installed them now to try them, I don't know what effect they have on gameplay yet, but I highly doubt they solve everything. For the average person, this game will only be an excersize in frustration. Too slow paced for the content to keep you interested, and too fast paced for you to figure out what's going before you just die.

*edit* ok so I'm running the usermade unnofficial patch 1.08.1 It DOES help with quite a few things, namely a lack of content, but also some major glitches. HOWEVER things are handled a bit differently, particularly in the security area. And there's a game crashing glitch with the way it's done, so be careful how you manage your security. There is apparently a 1.09 coming eventually, which will likely address this, but it's not a hurry and will be the last. I understand why. I still don't recommend this for any one looking for a casual game, it's just not... all there. and it won't hold your hand until you figure it out. You're going to fail, a lot. If you're willing to zerg your way to success, you'll enjoy this, and only if you spent less than $3 on it.

Edit: 1.09 is out and solves a lot. It's still a little glitchy but the save system is upgraded and most of the issues are minor. None CTD anymore. It's playable and enjoyable in its current state, Not perfect, but fun.","It's abandonned and glitchy, has a steep learning curve and isn't actually finished.

Точнее, сами авторы, возможно, и хотели бы выложить ее задаром. Однако все указывает на то, что спонсоры из Double Fine Productions решили, что на проект и так было потрачено слишком много денег, и что деньги эти нужно хоть как-то отбить, даже во вред репутации. К слову, если SDF-9 оказалась у вас в библиотеке игр, скорее всего, вы получили ее в бандле с другими играми Double Fine - на момент написания данного отзыва у игры были ""крайне отрицательные"" оценки на Steam, поэтому теперь купить ее отдельно пожелают немногие.

Как концепт SDF-9 вполне имела право на существование: крепких тайкунов сегодня выходит не так уж и много, поэтому игра про выживание в космосе в условиях постоянной нехватки кислорода, денег и рабочих рук могла стать хитом. В начале игры у нас очень маленькая команда, и пополняется она крайне нерегулярно (за счет время от времени дрейфующих в космосе кораблей, одинокие обитатели которых желают поселиться на станции). Тем не менее, одним и тем же членам экипажа в зависимости от ситуации приходится поручать разную работу - от строительства, майнинга ресурсов и врачебной деятельности до занятия садоводством, стояния за барной стойкой или защиты базы (у разных персонажей есть и разные предпочтения в работе, и разный уровень навыка в ее выполнении - часто эти показатели могут противоречить друг другу). 

Упомянутой команде требуются воздух, еда, отдых и развлечения, которые обеспечивают системы воздухочистки, сады, комната отдыха, фитнес-зал и бар; для их функционирования нужно определенное количество генераторов. А чтобы построить все это, нужны деньги, которые добываются при переработке добытых майнерами космических пород - значит, нужно еще и иметь рефайнер, который занимается такой переработкой. А для выхода майнеров в космос необходимо оборудовать отдельную комнату со скафандрами и особыми дверями, откачивающими воздух. А если не поставить на базе пару турелей, то ее может разрушить пара разбойников с первого попавшегося пиратского судна, заодно зачем-то перестреляв весь наш экипаж. И все бы ничего, но в той версии, которая продается сейчас на Steam есть три ключевых недостатка, которые могли бы быть исправлены на поздних стадиях разработки, если бы она была продолжена.

Первый недостаток - отсутствие внятного туториала. Тот, что есть, явно делался на скорую руку: большую часть геймплейных механик игроку приходится постигать самому, методом проб, ошибок и стартов с начала. Особенно это ощутимо при попытке запустить новую игру вне ""режима туториала"" (где вам с самого начала дается база из нескольких комнат с самыми важными постройками), а с ноля (где в открытом космосе висят три космонавта с запасом кислорода на 8 внутриигровых минут, ""сердечник"" базы и 2000 денег, которые в первый десяток попыток кончаются слишком быстро, заставляя вас раз за разом жать на рестарт).

Вторая проблема - сырой баланс, который явно не проходил проверку на команде тестеров перед релизом. Денег то постоянно не хватает, то не на что тратить. Людей сперва слишком много, а потом неадекватно мало (похоже, новые прилетают на дрейфующих кораблях совершенно рандомно, а ""заказать"" себе на базу рабочую силу с Земли невозможно). Строители строят новые комнаты ну очень медленно (кажется, это понимали сами авторы, встроившие в игру систему ""ускорения"" внутриигрового времени, но даже она не помогает избежать скуки). Некоторые постройки то ли бесполезны, то ли непонятно как влияют на состояние экипажа (в частности, ""комната отдыха"" им, кажется, просто не требуется, как и врачебный кабинет). Есть и просто странные геймдизайнерские решения, на ровном месте усложняющие и без того непростой игровой процесс: например, как только вы поставите в комнату строение определенного типа, вы больше не сможете ставить в ней строения другого типа (т.к. это строение ""окрашивает"" под собой всю поверхность пола, не отделенную стенами). То есть, если вы соорудили огромную комнату, поставили в ней барную стойку (предмет категории ""бар""), а потом решили разбить эту комнату на две, поставив в центре стенку, у вас ничего не выйдет: пол уже окрасился в синий, получайте два ""бара"", разделенных стенкой (один с барной стойкой, второй пустой). Не менее странно в игре работает геймплейная механика питания построек от генераторов: ряд рецензентов утверждает, что она и вовсе была вырезана из SDF-9, и что генераторы абсолютно бесполезны, однако в моем случае некоторые постройки все же жаловались на недостаток энергии. После чего я командовал строителям разобрать их и создать новые - тогда проблема с ""недостаточным питанием"" почему-то действительно исчезала.

Третья, самая заметная проблема - явный недостаток контента. Открыв меню построек в первый раз, игрок может удивиться большому числу категорий построек, но быстро выяснится, что в большинстве категорий содержится всего один тип объектов. И это не потому, что игра только началась, а потому, что другие типы объектов авторы просто не успели сделать. Один тип реакторов, один тип рефайнеров, один тип системы воздухоочистки, саженцев (хотя модельки у растений разные), кровати и тренажера в тренажерный зал. Потенциально новые члены команды, прилетающие на кораблях, обладают хорошо если дюжиной приветственных текстов и быстро начинают повторяться. Вашей базе угрожают внешние факторы из космоса, но видов у них немного: болезни, падение астероида и атака космических пиратов (то в одиночку, то парой). Решаются проблемы так же однообразно: назначьте врачей, потушите пожар, развесьте по коридорам турели. Игра продолжается, однообразные ситуации повторяются все чаще, и через пару часов развития базы игрок понимает: ему некуда - а главное, незачем - дальше расти. Конечной цели у игрока нет, зато карта (несмотря на рандомную генерацию) всегда имеет строгие границы и ограниченное число ресурсов. То есть, однажды все равно настанет момент, когда базе будет либо некуда, либо не на что расти - но игра все равно не закончится, пока вы не нажмете Escape и не начнете все заново. Получается, в ее текущем состоянии SDF-9 - это не тайкун, а, скорее, сэндбокс, причем довольно однообразный и с малым количеством доступных действий. 

Вердикт: явно недоделанная версия потенциально неплохой игры, убитой недостатком финансирования. Может быть, по цене в $0.90 она была бы вполне терпимой, но ярость игроков, купивших ее за $6.99, абсолютно понятна. Если SDF-9 ""как бы бесплатно"" попала к вам в библиотеку с бандлом игр от Double Fine, она даже может подарить вам пару часов любопытного геймплея - до тех пор, пока он не станет предсказуемым и утомительно однообразным. Не рекомендую ни за полную цену, ни даже по скидке.

P.S.: После шквала возмущений со стороны игроков издатель опубликовал код SDF-9 в открытый доступ и объявил, что будет рад любому труду мододелов. Проект это, впрочем, не спасло, потому что для ""культовости"" игре явно не хватает силенок, а работать бесплатно для спасения и так однажды погибшей разработки желающих почти не нашлось.","Spacebase DF-9 is an abandoned ""early access"" version of a potentially good space base construction tycoon. Its developers lost funding mid-development, so the project was shelved and released as-is on Steam for $6.99.

Or rather, the developers themselves might have wanted to release it for free. However, everything indicates that the backers at Double Fine Productions decided that too much money had already been spent on the project and that they needed to somehow recoup that money, even at the cost of their reputation. Incidentally, if you have SDF-9 in your game library, you most likely got it in a bundle with other Double Fine games—at the time of writing this review, the game has ""extremely negative"" ratings on Steam, so few people will be willing to buy it separately now.

The SDF-9 concept was perfectly feasible: tough tycoons aren't being released in large numbers these days, so a game about surviving in space with a constant shortage of oxygen, money, and manpower could be a hit. At the start of the game, we have a very small crew, and it's replenished extremely irregularly (from the occasional arrival of ships drifting through space, whose lonely inhabitants wish to settle on the station). However, the same crew members are tasked with various tasks depending on the situation—from construction, resource mining, and medical work to gardening, tending the bar, or defending the base (different characters have different work preferences and skill levels—these factors can often conflict with each other).

The crew requires air, food, rest, and entertainment, which are provided by air purification systems, gardens, a recreation room, a gym, and a bar; these require a certain number of generators to function. To build all this, you need money, which is earned by refining the space rocks mined by spacecraft—meaning you also need a refiner to handle the refining. And for miners to enter space, you need a separate room with spacesuits and special doors that pump out the air. And if you don't install a couple of turrets at the base, a couple of bandits from the first pirate ship they come across could destroy it, for some reason killing off your entire crew. This would be all well and good, but the version currently available on Steam has three key flaws that could have been fixed in the later stages of development, had it continued.

The first flaw is the lack of a coherent tutorial. The existing one was clearly rushed: the player has to figure out most of the gameplay mechanics themselves, through trial and error and starting over. This is especially noticeable when trying to launch a new game outside of the ""tutorial mode"" (where you're given a base consisting of a few rooms with the most important buildings from the start), but from scratch (where you're stuck in outer space with three astronauts with an oxygen supply for eight in-game minutes, a base ""core,"" and 2,000 coins, which run out too quickly in the first dozen tries, forcing you to hit restart again and again).

The second problem is the raw balance, which clearly wasn't tested by the test team before release. There's either a constant shortage of coins or nothing to spend them on. At first, there are too many people, then inappropriately few (new ones seem to arrive on drifting ships completely randomly, and it's impossible to ""order"" manpower from Earth to your base). Builders construct new rooms incredibly slowly (the developers themselves seem to have realized this when they built a system to ""speed up"" in-game time, but even it doesn't help stave off boredom). Some buildings are either useless or have an unclear effect on the crew's condition (in particular, they seem to have no need for a ""rest room,"" nor for a doctor's office). There are also simply strange game design decisions that unnecessarily complicate an already challenging gameplay: for example, once you place a building of a certain type in a room, you can no longer place buildings of a different type there (since that building ""paints"" the entire floor surface beneath it, not separated by walls). So, if you built a huge room, placed a bar counter (an item of the ""bar"" category) in it, and then decided to split the room into two by placing a wall in the center, it won't work: the floor is already painted blue, so you'll end up with two ""bars"" separated by a wall (one with a bar counter, the other empty). The gameplay mechanic of powering buildings with generators works equally strangely: some reviewers claim that this mechanic was cut from SDF-9 and that generators are completely useless. However, in my case, some buildings still complained about insufficient power. After I ordered my builders to dismantle them and create new ones, the ""insufficient power"" problem actually disappeared.

The third, most noticeable problem is a clear lack of content. Upon opening the building menu for the first time, the player may be surprised by the large number of building categories, but it quickly becomes clear that most categories contain only one type of object. And this isn't because the game has just begun, but because the developers simply haven't had time to implement other types of objects. There's one type of reactor, one type of refiner, one type of air purification system, one type of sapling (though the plant models are different), one bed, and one gym machine. Potential new team members arriving on ships are given maybe a dozen welcome messages and quickly become repetitive. Your base is threatened by external factors from space, but they come in a few varieties: diseases, asteroid impacts, and space pirate attacks (sometimes singly, sometimes in pairs). Problems are solved in the same monotonous way: assign doctors, put out fires, hang turrets along the corridors. The game continues, monotonous situations recur more and more frequently, and after a couple of hours of base development, the player realizes they have nowhere—and, more importantly, no reason—to grow. The player has no ultimate goal, but the map (despite random generation) always has strict boundaries and a limited number of resources. That is, there will inevitably come a point when the base either has no room or nothing to grow on—but the game won't end until you press Escape and start over. So, in its current state, SDF-9 isn't a tycoon, but rather a sandbox, a rather monotonous one at that, with few available actions.

Verdict: clearly an unfinished version of a potentially good game, killed by a lack of funding. Perhaps at $0.90 it would have been quite tolerable, but the anger of players who bought it for $6.99 is completely understandable. If SDF-9 ""seemingly free"" came to your library with a Double Fine game bundle, it might even offer a couple of hours of interesting gameplay—until it becomes predictable and tediously monotonous. I don't recommend it at full price, or even at a discount.

P.S.: After a flurry of player outcry, the publisher released the SDF-9 code open source and announced that it welcomed any contributions from modders. This, however, didn't save the project, as the game clearly lacked the resources to achieve cult status, and there were almost no volunteers willing to work for free to save a development that had already foundered."

When you're down on your luck, they send ships full of marauders every few seconds which makes it so you can't possibly keep up, let alone put out the fires and busted stuff they cause. Oh, and in case you're wondering, I chose to set up my base in a place where the threat level was ""Extremely Low"" so I could avoid these issues while I get good at the game.

Es geht dabei nicht einmal um das Spiel direkt, denn das Spiel kann nicht dafür, das seine Entwickler auf einmal ihre Arbeit einstellten und es seinem Schicksal überlassen würden.  
Der Ansatz eine Raumstation zu bauen und zu verwalten ist eigentlich hochinteressant und hätte sicherlich immer noch ziemliches potenzial. Warum es sowas bisher, meines wissend nach, nicht mehr gibt, verstehe ich gar nicht. Leider konnte dieses Spiel nie seine vollen Möglichkeiten entfalten. 
Es gibt wohl noch Fans, die versuchen aus dem, immerhin zur Verfügung gestellten Quell-Code, noch etwas zu machen aber das ändert nichts daran, das hier ein typisches Negativbeispiel für das Early-Access Programm vorliegt: Der Kauf eines nicht fertigen Spiels, birgt immer ein gewisses Risiko.  

Zum Glück gibt es bei weiten genug positive Beispiele als ausgleich.","I've dug a rather unfortunate 2013 purchase out of the depths of my library to write a negative review, which doesn't happen very often. This isn't even about the game itself, because the game can't be blamed for its developers suddenly stopping their work and leaving it to its fate.

The concept of building and managing a space station is actually very interesting and certainly still has considerable potential. Why, as far as I know, something like this doesn't exist anymore, I don't understand. Unfortunately, this game never reached its full potential.

There are probably still fans trying to make something out of the source code, which is at least made available, but that doesn't change the fact that this is a typical negative example of the Early Access program: Buying an unfinished game always carries a certain amount of risk.

Fortunately, there are more than enough positive examples to compensate."

Spacebase DF-9 war Bestandteil des Double Fine Bundles und wurde sehr schlecht bewertet.
Es ist jetzt Teil meiner Bibliothek, und ich Empfehle es ebenfalls nicht. Das Spiel war einst ein ""Early Access"" Titel, dessen Entwicklung allerdings vorzeitig Eingestellt wurde.

Auch wenn ich im Ansatz Potential erkannte, war der Spielfluss unausgeglichen, die Menüführung nicht wohl durchdacht und ich hatte einfach keinen Spass.
Es existiert ein von der Spielergemeinschaft gemachter Patch, der den Spieleinstieg glättete. Dadurch konnte ich eine funktionierende und wachsende Raumstation aufbauen, die mir eine kurze Weile Freude bereitete, bis ich durch Spielfehler und Eintönigkeit dem Spiel doch wieder überdrüssig wurde.

Als Teil eines 50% Rabatt Bündels mit 12 (jetzt 13) weiteren gut bewerteten und teils top Titeln kann ich diese kleine Sünde verschmerzen, empfinde es dennoch als unethische Geschäftspraktik, solche unfertigen Spiele zu vermarkten.","✯✯

Spacebase DF-9 was part of the Double Fine Bundle and received very poor reviews.
It's now part of my library, and I don't recommend it either. The game was once an ""Early Access"" title, but development was halted prematurely.

Even though I recognized its potential, the gameplay was unbalanced, the menu navigation was not well thought out, and I simply wasn't having fun.
There's a patch created by the community that smoothed the game's entry. This allowed me to build a functioning and growing space station, which I enjoyed for a short while, until the game's bugs and monotony finally made me tired of it.

As part of a 50% discount bundle with 12 (now 13) other well-reviewed and partly top-notch titles, I can overlook this small sin, but I still consider it an unethical business practice to market such unfinished games."

Pro:
1- Functional but buggy, Its a decent time waster if you install the unofficial patches.
2- Rogue-like (ish) (if you like that sort of thing) its not specifically marketed that way but it has the unforgiving hallmarks of said genre, things can cascade from ""No Problem"" to ""Your Last Colonist was just sucked out into space"" becuase of battle damage leaving a hole in your station that you cant seal off and cant repair becuase there are raiders rampaging in your base, your airlocks are all broke and the doors leading to the hole have all been wrecked by the 7th or 8th raider team. This doesnt appear to be due to a bug but its hard to tell
3- I got my money's worth, I tend to have a $1 per 1hr of entertainment rule on purchases, im at 13 hours and I got it for $5 so even at full price it would have met my standards
4- Has some interesting elements and random events but you get pretty good at figuring out which are the good and which are the bad and how to avoid them

The Cons:
1-Buggy, security wont always explore derelicts properly, They will sometimes continue to target an incapacitated crewmate who you had them knock out while they were rampaging and many many others I cant even list them all here

3- gives you a look at what might have been with proper support and development which leaves it feeling unsatisfying


TL;DR if you are looking to waste an afternoon watching station after station get destroyed after you spent hours building it up, if you are the kind who enjoys walling sims up and letting them die, you can do that here too, you can even vent the oxygen from the room if you want. If all that appeals to you AND You get it on sale, it will scratch an itch for at most one afternoon

I cannot recommend it due to the fact that its utterly abandoned and has been for several years. I can see what it might have been with proper support however and it would have been fun.","I owned this game since it was in EA (I got it on sale) and never installed it, after it was cancelled I forgot about it. Then I ran across it in my library again so decided to install it. After giving it 13 hours here is my assessment.

Pro:
1- Functional but buggy, Its a decent time waster if you install the unofficial patches.
2- Rogue-like (ish) (if you like that sort of thing) its not specifically marketed that way but it has the unforgiving hallmarks of said genre, things can cascade from ""No Problem"" to ""Your Last Colonist was just sucked out into space"" becuase of battle damage leaving a hole in your station that you cant seal off and cant repair becuase there are raiders rampaging in your base, your airlocks are all broke and the doors leading to the hole have all been wrecked by the 7th or 8th raider team. This doesnt appear to be due to a bug but its hard to tell
3- I got my money's worth, I tend to have a $1 per 1hr of entertainment rule on purchases, im at 13 hours and I got it for $5 so even at full price it would have met my standards
4- Has some interesting elements and random events but you get pretty good at figuring out which are the good and which are the bad and how to avoid them

The Cons:
1-Buggy, security wont always explore derelicts properly, They will sometimes continue to target an incapacitated crewmate who you had them knock out while they were rampaging and many many others I cant even list them all here
2- Abandonware/Cancelled at this point even the team that was putting out the unofficial patches and upates has abandoned it. It is what it is and it will never change.

Обилие негативных отзывов и отсутствие локализации отпугнуло значительную часть русскоговорящих игроков. Признаюсь, я сам попался на эту удочку. Но, вот, купил игру на распродаже. С чувством выброшенных на ветер денег запустил. И ... Она мне понравилась! Spacebase DF-9 это стратегия непрямого контроля. Интересная анимация астронавтов. Забавная графика. Возможность выбора сложности игры путем задания координат места высадки первичной капсулы с тремя астронавтами. Музыка ненавязчивая, а при приближении камеры слышны различные звуки на станции.
Вначале очень не хватало русской локализации.  Отвлекает, когда то и дело приходится лазить в GOOGL за переводом. Но сейчас перевод появился. Отлично передан юмор игры. Играть стало намного приятней. 
А большинство нареканий на так называемые ""баги"", на мой взгляд, из-за непонимания пользователями игровой механики.
У меня был случай. Срочно понадобился карцер для разбушевавшегося медика. Думаю,  он выпил чего-то спиртсодержащего у себя в медпункте. Под руку подвернулся пустующий отсек с автоматом раздачи еды. Я быстро переименовал его в ""карцер"", сунул туда медика, и забыл про этот эпизод... Но астронавты почему-то в карцер за едой ходить не стали, вплоть до голодных обмороков. Один даже грохнулся в обморок в переходном шлюзе. Из-за чего шлюз перестал открываться. И пока второй доктор щупал бедняге пульс, ставил диагноз, приводил в себя .... шлюз не работал. Ну не должны посторонние находиться в шлюзовой зоне. А в это время на базу пытался попасть шахтер, у которого заканчивался запас кислорода. Работяга чуть не погиб от удушья, но за несколько секунд до отключения воздуха - наконец влетел на базу. А причину всего бардака я понял после, когда проанализировал события.
Еще один раз не уследил за кислородом. Количество людей превысило допустимую норму. Но пока я тянул с постройкой новых генераторов кислорода, на базе нарастала паника. Никто не хотел строить новые реакторы, только бегали с выпученными глазами и трясущимися руками. Ну и ... Все погибли. Остался в живых только один шахтер, который в это время летал на астероид за рудой. Представляю, что он пережил, когда вернулся на базу :). Но станция после этого все равно восстановилась.
Вобщем, хорошая веселая игрушка. Не ведитесь на плохие отзывы, пока не попробуете ее сами.
P/s играю пока на версии 1.06. Но энтузиасты не забросили игру. Выпускаются не официальные патчи. Думаю стоит попробовать.","In my opinion, one of the most underrated games.
The abundance of negative reviews and the lack of localization scared off a significant portion of Russian-speaking players. I admit, I fell for it myself. But then, I bought the game on sale. I launched it with a feeling of having wasted money. And... I liked it! Spacebase DF-9 is an indirect control strategy game. Interesting astronaut animations. Fun graphics. You can choose the game's difficulty by setting the coordinates for the landing site of the primary capsule with three astronauts. The music is unobtrusive, and when the camera zooms in, you can hear various sounds around the station.
At first, a Russian localization was sorely missed. It was distracting when you constantly had to search Google for a translation. But now there is a translation. The game's humor is perfectly captured. It's much more enjoyable to play.
And most complaints about so-called ""bugs,"" in my opinion, are due to users' misunderstanding of the game mechanics.
I had a similar experience. A punishment cell was urgently needed for a raging medic. I think he drank something alcoholic back in his medical station. An empty compartment with a food dispenser came to hand. I quickly renamed it ""shutting cell,"" shoved the medic in there, and forgot about the whole episode... But for some reason, the astronauts refused to go to the punishment cell for food, even fainting from hunger. One even fainted in the airlock, which stopped the airlock from opening. And while the second doctor was taking the poor guy's pulse, making a diagnosis, and bringing him back to his senses... the airlock wasn't working. Well, strangers shouldn't be in the airlock area. Meanwhile, a miner, his oxygen supply running low, was trying to get into the base. The worker nearly died of suffocation, but just seconds before the airlock shut off, he finally made it into the base. I realized the cause of all this chaos later, when I analyzed the events.
I lost track of the oxygen again. The number of people exceeded the permissible limit. But while I was delaying building new oxygen generators, panic was growing at the base. No one wanted to build new reactors; they just ran around with bulging eyes and shaking hands. And then... Everyone died. Only one miner survived, who was flying to the asteroid for ore at the time. I can imagine what he went through when he returned to the base :). But the station was still restored after that.
Overall, it's a good, fun game. Don't be fooled by the bad reviews until you try it for yourself.
P.S. I'm currently playing on version 1.06. But enthusiasts haven't abandoned the game. Unofficial patches are being released. I think it's worth a try."

I still think there’s a lot of potential here, but Double Fine walked away instead of finishing it.  If this were still in early access and still being developed it would be worth checking out, but unfortunately it’s neither of those things.  I bought it in early access and knew there was a possibility of it never getting finished, but I certainly didn’t expect that to happen with Double Fine.  I’m amazed they’re still selling it.

Here's some obvious missing things (there are probably more):
- Overviews of things like moods, productivity, disease spread, food supplies, facility utilization, etc.
- Cleaning up blood / etc from the floors
- Ways to draw player’s attention to things like broken walls or that there are X raiders and Y killbots in the base and where exactly they are (it tells you when they enter but that notification stays even if turrets take care of them at the door)
- Specify higher priority for certain build or repair jobs (sometimes you really need another oxygen recycler but your builders are more interested in tearing down the derelict vessel)
- Selecting the next thing to research without needing to find your research lab and click on the empty floor or wall space

As is you can sort of get a space base started, but the game quickly reveals how unfinished it is.","TLDR:  Out of early access in name only, this game is abandoned by the developer unfinished and full of bugs.  You shoudn’t buy it.

Podria estar bien si se hubieran molestado en hacer el juego.
Es impresionante que los jefes de esta producción, habiendo participado en titulos épicos del mundo de los videojuegos, hayan dejado que este producto a medio hacer esté a la venta, y conste como acabado. 

Esta no es la forma en que un estudio decente saca algo a Early Acces; Ellos mismos deberian saber que lo de Early Access es sólo una patraña para sacar dinero con la que ACABAR de financiar un proyecto y ver cuanto dinero merece la pena usar en dar retoques.

No es lo que ha pasado aqui; Se ha sacado un juego a medio hacer (uno que unos indies a media jornada podrian tener listo en 8-12 meses), sin 0 pulido (imagino que esperaban que la comunidad les explicase como pulirlo..) y luego han visto que no habia suficiente gente comprandolo para pagar los salarios.

Esto es el mercado amigos. Saca algo que esté casi hecho, no un producto a medio hacer, parece el juego indie abandonado de un principiante.

En mi opinión, en vez de pagar salarios astronomicos a Jefes de Diseño, Jefes de Programación, Jefes de RPy Jefes de Jefes, podrian haberle decidido los derechos a algun estudio indie para que lo siguiese desarollando hasta estar bien hecho y compartir beneficios.","I recommend it to video game developers who don't mind spending a couple of euros on sale to see how you shouldn't release a game into Early Access.

It could have been fine if they had bothered to make the game at all.
It's shocking that the heads of this production, having worked on epic titles in the world of video games, have allowed this half-finished product to be released, and it's considered finished.

This isn't how a decent studio releases something into Early Access; they themselves should know that Early Access is just a ploy to raise money to FINISH funding a project and see how much money is worth spending on tweaking it.

That's not what happened here; They released a half-baked game (one that part-time indie developers could have ready in 8-12 months), with absolutely no polish (I imagine they were hoping the community would explain how to polish it...), and then they realized there weren't enough people buying it to pay their salaries.

This is the market, folks. Release something that's almost finished, not a half-baked product that looks like an abandoned indie game from a beginner.

In my opinion, instead of paying astronomical salaries to Heads of Design, Heads of Programming, Heads of PR, and Heads of Heads, they could have given the rights to an indie studio so they could continue developing it until it was well done and share the profits."

Warp Gate proximity determines how often ships and visitors appear.
Magnetic Fields determine the presence of derelect ships to investigate.
Debris is how many asteroids are to mine, and how often you're hit with them. (not often)
Hostilities is of course, how many bad guys show up.
There aren't really any specific points per say, it's more for RP.

You can't research anything.. but there are in-game Goals, and the graphics fit very well. AI can be fairly stupid at times, like boarding a derelict craft and getting murdered as soon as they pass the airlock.. I lost 8 staff this way, until a couple of builders managed to deconstruct their airlock! I then cut little holes in each room's wall to suffocate the occupants! BWAHAHA. You can have doors on the outer wall that are sealed, then lock intruders in their rooms and manually open them.. many ways to play.

As I said, you cannot research your armor or better weapons.. but for 300 materials you can mount a laser turret into the airlock and around your base to vaporize any intruder in a couple of hits :D.

Another fine feature is that you start the game with 1,000 power but if you save & exit, then load again it drops to 500. I almost lost everybody to a station-wide systems failure but here's what I did:
Space suits provide 8 minutes of O2 so first I put everyone into space suits by giving them the 'Builder' job, and built a 6x6 room with a Fusion Reactor in it for a total of ~300 materials, which I had already. In a gamer point of view, this seems like a terrible job at programming but imagine if in the real world, your station suddenly lost all power for no dicernable reason! In that regard, the bugs give the mission more unpredicabilities to work around :).

Currently around 5.00 would be an adequate average for the amount of time you may spend on it (I've been playing about 5.5 hours today!) and how you RP the scenarios. There's a user in the Discussions who is trying to fix the game through patches (modding). v1.08 is available at the time of this review, but v1.09 has haken 6 months already.

En fait, je fais une critique positive pour trancher avec toutes les autres et éventuellement attirer l'attention.
Mais ne vous y trompez pas, ce n'est pas la meilleure simulation spatiale loin de là!
Le plus gros soucis étant principalement l'IA. Tant qu'il ne se passe rien de spécial, qu'il n'y a pas de situations compliquées comme un feu, etc... Et bien l'IA se comportera à peu près normalement.
Mais dès que c'est un peu le foutoir, vos compagnons interstellaires se comportent comme des idiots notoires et vous enragerez sur certaines situations.
Par exemple, il y a un feu et plus d'oxygène dans un compartiment et bien certains idiots ne vont même pas avoir à l'esprit de fuir et tenter de s'échapper mais vont paniquer comme des débiles jusqu'à en crever!
Voilà à quoi vous attendre! Heureusement il y a des patchs non officiels qui semblent intéressants mais ils ont tendance à faire planter le jeu j'ai remarqué.
Donc, vous me direz avec ces critiques quel intérêt d'investir quelques piécettes dans ce jeu???
Et bien, je ne sais comment l'expliquer mais ce jeu a un côté agréable et hypnotique!
On prend du plaisir à construire et voir utiliser votre personnel les sas pour aller dans l'espace, se battre avec des envahisseurs (raiders), aller chercher du minerai... Bref, tout ceci est plaisant.
Mais ne vous attendez pas et n'espérez pas des miracles de ce jeu, on est loin d'une simulation spatiale pointue mais juste plaisante qui peut vous détendre un certain temps.","Do I recommend this game? Yes, for less than two euros... (and even then)
Actually, I'm writing a positive review to stand out from all the others and possibly attract attention.
But make no mistake, this isn't the best space simulation, far from it!
The biggest problem is mainly the AI. As long as nothing special happens, as long as there aren't complicated situations like a fire, etc., the AI ​​will behave more or less normally.
But as soon as things get a bit messy, your interstellar companions behave like notorious idiots, and you'll get furious over certain situations.
For example, if there's a fire and there's no oxygen in a compartment, some idiots won't even think about fleeing and trying to escape, but will panic like idiots until they die!
That's what you can expect! Fortunately, there are unofficial patches that seem interesting, but I've noticed they tend to crash the game.
So, with these reviews, you'll tell me what's the point of investing a few coins in this game???
Well, I don't know how to explain it, but this game has a pleasant and hypnotic quality!
It's fun building and watching your crew use the airlocks to go into space, fight invaders (raiders), search for ore... In short, it's all enjoyable.
But don't expect or hope for miracles from this game; it's far from a sophisticated space simulation, but simply a pleasant one that can relax you for a while."

Spacebase is a game in which you establish your own base with the use of initially a 3 man crew and can accept more in but have to balance oxygen consumption as well as various other micromanaging aspects which indeed sounds fun but here's my issue, the AI is blantently broken, I've had times where I've assigned 2 crew members to be miners out of 4 and sent them out to excavate debris for materials, but the idiots stop and idle half way through and do nothing but stare blankly at the bloody rocks as they use up their oxygen and eventually sufficate and because this is early game I have no hospital to send them to so they die of lack of oxygen which is dumb as hell since it wasn't my fault the idiots died staring at rocks and forgot to breathe. The game starts off quite difficult and leaves you pressed for time which I actually like as it pressures you into keeping your crew alive, unfortunately I can't tell you about the late game cause I can't get there cause half my crew die looking at rocks, then another few die at a random event that sucks them out of the airlock or they simply get killed by pirates. Another thing that's dumb is you'd have crew members doing excercise in the base, right fair enough, but they do it in the airlock so when someone comes in that crew member without a suit gets sucked into space and dies.

Spacebase is a game in which you establish your own base with the use of initially a 3 man crew and can accept more in but have to balance oxygen consumption as well as various other micromanaging aspects which indeed sounds fun but here's my issue, the AI is blantently broken, I've had times where I've assigned 2 crew members to be miners out of 4 and sent them out to excavate debris for materials, but the idiots stop and idle half way through and do nothing but stare blankly at the bloody rocks as they use up their oxygen and eventually sufficate and because this is early game I have no hospital to send them to so they die of lack of oxygen which is dumb as hell since it wasn't my fault the idiots died staring at rocks and forgot to breathe. The game starts off quite difficult and leaves you pressed for time which I actually like as it pressures you into keeping your crew alive, unfortunately I can't tell you about the late game cause I can't get there cause half my crew die looking at rocks, then another few die at a random event that sucks them out of the airlock or they simply get killed by pirates. Another thing that's dumb is you'd have crew members doing excercise in the base, right fair enough, but they do it in the airlock so when someone comes in that crew member without a suit gets sucked into space and dies. This game is broken and the devs have long since abandoned it which is a shame since I've heard great things about double fine but this is the first and last game I shall ever get from them due to how bad the quality of this game is.

Enfin , je veux dire que meme apres autant de temps , s'ils se bougeaient un peu , ils pourraient le finir. Ils ont des millions , rien que mettre 1 dev ou 2 , pas plus , les mecs pourraient améliorer le jeu en quelques mois ( Faut dire que pour faire pire, ce serai dur, donc ils ne risqueraient pas grand chose ) 

Donc je vais faire comme tout le monde ,car de toute façon , le jeu merite pas mieux qu'un avis négatif , mais j'espère qu'un jour , ils soient touchés par la grace et se remettent un peu dessus car la base est très bonne , l'idée également. 

A peut-etre dans 2 ou 3 ans s'ils sont de bonne humeur et donnent envie de changer la note =D

Bon jeu a tous","This is the first game I've seen rated ""Extremely Negative.""

I'm just wondering, even though it's four years later, don't the devs mind having such a lousy rating?
Well, I mean, even after so much time, if they'd get a little more work done, they could finish it. They have millions, and just by hiring one or two developers, no more, these guys could improve the game in a few months (I have to say, it would be hard to do worse, so they wouldn't risk much).

So I'm going to do what everyone else does, because in any case, the game doesn't deserve anything better than a negative review, but I hope that one day, they'll be touched by grace and get back to it a little because the foundation is very good, as is the idea.

Maybe in 2 or 3 years if they're in a good mood and make you want to change the rating =D

You may be curious of why this game has so many negative reviews thats probably why you click on the store page of this game. This game and its developer is the reason why early access can never be fully trusted, Barely polished and abandoned we all saw potential for a spaceship crew management game.

IN SHORT... If you could rent a goat for $10 and pet it just for a day. You wouldn't regret the goat and be proud you didn't spend you $10 on one of Steams Early Access Unfinished Failures. 

*You may think the playtime I put into this game is not enough to justify my review but trust me as a consumer and someone that loves video-games I've purchased games I don't even get the chance to play (e.g Nether, Survival).


- You don't have to read this part - 
An Early Access game I do not regret purchasing years back is Rust, as I put an amount of playtime into the game when the game was in alpha and looked like an unfinished Unity asset game. I thought that Rust would've been another bad purchase on my, but if you look at Rust now in its 7-8 year development cycle (which is hella long). The game is still flourishing and the developers are still committed, updating the game occasionally keeping the game alive and its community on board. 

As I digress, early access is not such a bad investment specially when the asking price for an unfinished game is affordable. If you are interested in a small or indie company developing an impressive game please do some research before throwing your hard earned simoleans ($) on a game that has barely been worked hard on by its developer.   
 
 
OLD REVIEW [March, 2018]
If I had a chance to go back in time and choose between either spending $10 on this game or paying a farmer $10 to pet his goat for 1.1 hours...

I'd choose the goat.

I began building in a region with extremely low danger but after about an hour of cultivating a smoothly running spacebase I started getting raider attacks. At first it was within a few minutes of each other so I built some turrets and beefed up security. Then it became constant so I sealed off entire areas and cut life support to suffocate the raiders.

It might not have been so bad, but the NPCs are morons. Builders have no sense of priority, leaving gaping holes in walls or avoiding installing doors in favour of other tasks, leaving entire areas uninhabitable until they get around to it.

Basicamente desperdicei 10 horas tentando passar só do ""tutorial"", achando que tinha feito cagadas de noob e ia conseguir na próxima vez. Acontece que o tutorial não explica nada e o cenário é muito escuro e confuso (não tem opção de aumentar brilho!! aliás, as opções de ajuste são praticamente inexistentes). Além disso, toda hora vem inimigos e os personagens estão sempre muito tristes, mesmo se você colocar eles pra fazer um trabalho que gosta e colocar entretenimento e coisas que deixariam eles felizes na base. Beleza, tem todo aquele dilema de estar sozinho no espaço e o bônus da galera morrendo o tempo todo que deixaria qualquer um triste, mas não importa o que vc faça, parece que a tendência é ficar cada vez mais triste, e assim terem um surto psicótico (que é literalmente o que acontece) e começarem a destruir a base. Vc algema o indivíduo, coloca pra ser internado na enfermaria, mas ngm leva ele, então o único jeito é matar.
Enfim, acaba que tudo é muito escasso e como vc não tem controle sobre os personagens e eles são burros, nada é feito na base e vc fica estagnado (fora que se alguém atacar um personagem quando ele não está definido como segurança ele surta e morre, e eles não desviam a rota quando tem algum perigo e vc não tem como fazer esse aviso, ou seja, morrem mto fácil). 

Tudo isso faz com que o jogo fique com uma execução muito lenta. Pode ser que se eu tivesse com paciência eu concluiria a primeira fase, mas o jogo me dá dor de cabeça de tão lento que é o andamento (a velocidade 3, a máxima, às vezes parece ser a normal).

É uma pena enorme pq a premissa eu gostei demais, e tirando o que disse a execução é muito boa, mas essas coisas fazem com que o jogo seja extremamente frustrante e te consuma um tempo enorme por nada. Tô agora é com muita vontade de jogar um jogo assim, com a mesma idéia, mas com a execução correta","As already mentioned, the idea is very good! The execution has very interesting aspects and would be great if the character AI weren't so dumb and the gameplay weren't so slow.

I basically wasted 10 hours trying to get through the ""tutorial"" alone, thinking I'd made some noobish mistake and would get it right next time. It turns out the tutorial doesn't explain anything, and the environment is very dark and confusing (there's no option to increase brightness! In fact, the adjustment options are practically nonexistent). Furthermore, enemies constantly appear, and the characters are always very sad, even if you have them do a job they enjoy and provide entertainment and things that would make them happy at the base. Okay, there's that whole dilemma of being alone in space and the bonus of people dying all the time that would make anyone sad, but no matter what you do, it seems like the tendency is to get sadder and sadder, and then have a psychotic break (which is literally what happens) and start destroying the base. You handcuff the individual and have them admitted to the infirmary, but no one takes them, so the only option is to kill them.
Anyway, everything ends up being very scarce, and since you have no control over the characters and they're stupid, nothing gets done at the base, and you're left stagnant (not to mention, if someone attacks a character when they're not set to safety, they freak out and die, and they don't deviate when there's danger, and you can't warn them, meaning they die very easily).

All of this makes the game very slow. Maybe if I had the patience, I could finish the first level, but the game gives me a headache because it's so slow (speed 3, the maximum, sometimes feels like normal).

It's a huge shame because I really liked the premise, and other than that, the execution is very good, but these things make the game extremely frustrating and waste a lot of your time for nothing. Now I really want to play a game like this, with the same idea, but with the correct execution."

Puntos en contra:
1- El tutorial no explica bien ciertas cosas.
2-Solo se puede tener 1 partida activa con 1 solo punto de guardado. (única partida que vas a tener o empiezas de 0, nada de volver atras)
3- Las llamadas de ""aliados/piradas"" son iguales, no hay variedad. He jugado 4 horas y sólo he visto 3 o 4 con el mismo texto de ""ayuda/amenaza"".
4- A veces se bugea; leí en otros comentarios eso pero no pensé que me iba a pasar. En una parte se me volvió loca la maquina de defenza y mato a todos (estaba en modo protección). Aunque los bugs se arreglan reiniciando.
5-De vez en cuando viene otra nave a estar cerca  (decides si la invades con tu seguridad y la reclamas o no) pero todas las invasiones son modelos muy similares con 2 o 1 tripulante.
6-Lo más ""exitante"" fue cuando me invadieron de a 6 naves aprox...
7- Luego de una buena administración ya no hay nada que hacer, tus mismos tripulantes apagan el fuego, reestablecen las cosas. Lo único que queda hacer es seleccionar minas y reparar paredes que se hayan roto por asteroides.
8- Por ahí se mueren de guerra o asfixiados en el espacio pero no se pueden reciclar los cuerpos o sacarlos...quedan ahí indefinidamente.
9- El fondo es siempre del mismo planeta, no cambia y tampoco te mueves como mencioné anteriormente.
10- Hay cosas que uno no puede contruir como las maquinas para transladarse (sí, quería moverme muucho por el espacio)
11- No hay variedad de objetos; cada habitación que construyas tiene 1 o 2 tipos de objetos (sacando los 10 objetos que se pueden poner en todas las zonas).
12- Las zonas seleccionadas son solamente para una cosa.
13-Literalmente la primera vez vas a morir asfixiado porque no es automatico el tutorial y tampoco te explica como empezar.

Puntos a favor:
1-Me gusta la variedad de razas y cómo estan hechas, desde los hombres pollo hasta pajaros o parasitos. 
2-Te da ""tips"" de las cosas que se pueden mejorar o si pasa algo en tu base.
3-Cada ser tiene ""necesidades"" así que no siempre hacen todo automaticamente, a veces primero, comen y duermen lo cuál lo hace más realista y te hace pensar en que cosas hacer primero.

Se veía ""bonito"" y prometedor el juego, es una lástima que no lo desarrollen más ¡Tenía mucho potencial!, yo me imaginaba en un futuro agregar más objetos, seres y hasta un online pero luego ví que los desarrolladores ya no ven este juego y los mismos usuarios lo ven como abandonado, una lástima ¡Espero que les sirva mi comentario! ¡Un abrazo y descansa en paz buen jueguito!","If there's one thing I like, it's good stories and exploration. The game is good at first, but later on, it gets repetitive, in my opinion. Here's a list of what I didn't like:

Cons:
1- The tutorial doesn't explain certain things well.
2- You can only have one active game with one save point. (You'll only have one save point, or you'll start from scratch, no going back.)
3- The calls for ""allies/crazy people"" are the same; there's no variety. I've played for four hours and only seen three or four with the same ""help/threat"" text.
4- It sometimes bugs; I read about this in other reviews, but I didn't think it would happen to me. At one point, my defense system went crazy and killed everyone (I was in protection mode). Although the bugs can be fixed by restarting.
5- Occasionally, another ship comes nearby (you decide whether to invade it with your security and claim it or not), but all the invasions are very similar, with only one or two crew members.
6- The most ""exciting"" was when I was invaded by approximately six ships...
7- After a good administration, there's nothing left to do; your own crew members put out the fire and restore things. The only thing left to do is select mines and repair walls that have been broken by asteroids.
8- Some people die from war or suffocate in space, but you can't recycle or remove the bodies... they stay there indefinitely.
9- The background is always the same planet; it doesn't change, and you don't move around, as I mentioned before.
10- There are things you can't build, like the machines for moving around (yes, I really wanted to move around in space).
11- There's no variety of objects; Each room you build has one or two types of objects (excluding the 10 objects that can be placed in all areas).
12. Selected areas are only for one purpose.
13. You'll literally suffocate to death the first time because the tutorial isn't automatic and doesn't explain how to start.

Pros:
1. I like the variety of races and how they're made, from chicken men to birds and parasites.
2. It gives you tips on things that can be improved or if something happens in your base.
3. Each creature has ""needs,"" so they don't always do everything automatically. Sometimes they eat and sleep first, which makes it more realistic and makes you think about what to do first.

The game looked ""nice"" and promising, it's a shame they don't develop it more. It had a lot of potential! I imagined adding more objects, beings and even an online experience in the future, but then I saw that the developers no longer see this game and the users themselves see it as abandoned.

Right from the get-go, Spacebase-DF9 doesn't do much to ""wow"" you.  There are no cinematics or anything, and aside from possibly wanting to change Options, you'll quickly find yourself at a map of the galaxy, to choose where to start your base.  Depending on which coordinates you choose, relevant factors to your gameplay can differ - Stellar Density, which affects both how many resources there are and how frequently asteroids will hit your base - Warpgate Proximity, which affects how frequently you'll get visitors, wanted and otherwise - Threat Factor, which determines the frequency of Raider attacks - and Magnetic Interference, which determines the frequency of derelict vessels appearing.

Even at the first screen of ""actual"" gameplay, I have three issues with the game.  One, that your typical ""difficulty"" settings are pretty much thrown out the window.  You'd think that ""low threat"" would just be easy mode, but the threats still increase exponentially - I'll go into greater detail below.  Two, that there are a few different variables with which to basically ""seed"" your corner of the galaxy, but rather than let the player outright pick them, if you have particular settings you want, you have to scour the galaxy, pixel by pixel (okay, each area is maybe like 3 pixels wide, but it's still a huge area), until you find a spot you like.  If you want to force the player to try something new with each new game (which I'd be okay with, especially since this isn't exactly a ""difficulty"" setting), then just make it random, but it shouldn't be such a tedious process.  Third, why not tie Threat to Magnetic Frequency?  Raiders and derelict ships should go hand-in-hand, whether the ships are derelict due to Raider attacks, or the Raiders are there to loot the ships.  This would better fit the double-edge-sword nature of the other variables.

Something I mentioned above, and only becomes more prevalent the more you start to actually play the game, is that there is no story.  There are no cinematics, no voice acting, no plot, no progression from one stage to another.  You just survive in your base until you can no longer survive.  Many story-light games will still give you hints of backstory with item descriptions, and some of the dialogue.  In DF-9, just about all of the dialogue is tongue-in-cheek, but it succeeds more at confusing the player as to what the character is trying to do than being entertaining, and makes no discernible attempt to flesh out the galaxy.  The same goes for item descriptions, though they can, on occasion, at least give you a little more useful information than the dialogue does.  Character designs are interesting (sometimes), but since alien races don't line up with dialogue or have any impact on a colonist's abilities (just their name) it feels incredibly pointless, and more like the variety is just there because it's what everyone does in sci-fi.

Once you manage to forgive those issues, and actually start playing the game in earnest, you'll get your starting 3 residents.  You build your first handful of rooms of base by assigning them relevant jobs - namely Builder at the start.  Before long, you've got the whole ""oxygen"" problem under wraps (for the moment anyway), and have enough opportunity to ""breathe"" to start worrying about and make use of the two major ""stat"" pages for your residents.  The first, which is much easier to understand the ramifications for, is the Job screen.

When you view all the Jobs for your Base, it's shown as a spreadsheet comparing each resident to each job.  (I find it far more useful than simply viewing one resident and a list of each job.)  There, you get to see which jobs residents like or dislike doing - and how strongly - represented by an emoticon, and how skilled they are at each job, represented by a number of stars.  It's a bit strange that there's very little correlation between skills and likes - real people tend not to loathe things they're really good at, nor remain inept at their greatest passion.  But compared to the other issues in the game, this is pretty easy to forgive.  And frankly, this screen does its job just fine.  It's the second ""stat"" page for citizens, Personal Needs, that can cause nightmares.

At first glance, it's perfectly reasonable.  Sort of like The Sims, each resident has needs that must be met, and they will automatically go about meeting needs, especially if they're far from satisfied.  So if they're Hungry, they'll go to the Food Replicator and acquire some fabricated sustenance, or if they're not feeling sufficiently Social, they'll go chat in the Pub.  But there at the Pub, you'll find a problem that only gets worse the more you learn about it.  Sometimes, your citizens will get into a fight.  In my experience, this always left a citizen knocked out on the ground, though I felt like if I could just get a citizen in Security to respond fast enough, they could break up the fight before anyone gets badly injured.  Anyway, this can give you a considerable setback, as not only does it hurt Morale (which means they're less likely to work), it means the loser/victim will be out of commission for a while, their recovery will take work from your Doctor(s), and you'll need to have sufficient space in the Medbay.

As you grow your base's population to accomodate its continued expansion, fights will break out in greater frequency, naturally causing you to investigate why they do, and how you can prevent them.  So you take a closer look at the citizens' Needs.  And sure, you find that there's usually a correlation between low Morale and fights.  So you keep the food in the Pub better stocked.  You install more Monitors in the base so the citizens can more easily entertain themselves.  Some citizens weren't having their Duty needs met, but it's because you felt a bit of a crunch, and you had citizens doing Jobs just because it's what they were good at, but not what they liked doing.  So you spend an extra ten minutes at the Jobs screen, to make sure everyone's doing a job they at least like doing, if not love, even if it means some jobs will get done a bit slower while they hone their skills.  And things are good for a while; fewer fights, more productivity, means a happy player.  Maybe at this point you're starting to struggle with the increased frequency of Raider attacks, but for the sake of completing this thought before talking about that one, let's say everything's actually starting to go well.  It's going well, that is, until the citizens start fighting again.

You check the Morale of everyone involved in the fight, and it's doing alright.  The fight may have caused the victim/loser to take a dip in theirs, but it's certainly not what caused it.  Each of the needs is pretty well satisfied.  But then you take a closer look at the aggressor's Needs.  He's been at a job he loves for a while now, and his Duty is well satisfied - fully satisfied, actually.  Everything looks great.  But then you look at his personal job rating - egotistical.  That's right, if you make your citizens too happy, they'll overinflate their egos, and fight each other anyway!  It was at this point I had to put the game down for good.  But this came after I had been struggling with Raiders for many playthroughs.

Apparently I need to keep it short due to review length limits.  Basically, they wind up getting extremely hard as time goes on, seemingly increasing in difficulty faster than you can hope to develop defenses.  There seems to be a sort of ""final wave"" of Raiders but I was never able to fend them off, even with a dozen point defense lasers shooting down most of their ships.

In summary, think long and hard before deciding to buy Spacebase DF-9.  It's not just not for everyone, it's only for a very niche, forgiving group of gamers.","Base management games already aren't for everyone.  Even for those who like the genre, Spacebase DF-9 can be difficult to enjoy.

Das Spiel hat seit nun über 2 Jahren keine Updates mehr bekommen und wird wohl auch nie wieder welche kriegen. Es ist unfertig und das merkt man leider an jeder Ecke. 
Die Bewohner können verschiedene ""Berufe"" annehmen und die dementsprechende Tätigkeiten ausführen. Jeder Charakter hat verschiedene Fähigkeiten in den Berufsfeldern und wird mit der Zeit im zugeteilten Beruf besser. Leider fühlt sich fast alles extrem holprig an, von Bauen über Ausbauen zu ""Kämpfen"". 
Das Kämpfen steht nich ohne Grund in Anführungszeichen: Man kann Bewohnern quasi die Rolle einer Polzei zuteilen, doch dummerweise stellen sich jene ohne Berufserfahrung äußerst dumm an. Wenn Gegner kommen laufen sie häufig dorthin und machen exakt gar nichts.
Es gibt wenige Räume mit noch weniger Ausstattung und eine große Basis bietet (nach meine Gefühl zumindest) mehr Nach- als Vorteile. Man bekommt sehr langsam neue Bewohner dazu. Dennoch muss die Basis der großer werdenden Besatzung ausreichend Räumlichkeiten bieten. Trotzdem hat man im Endeffekt selbst in den leichten Karten nie genug Personal um alles in Sinnvoller Menge zu besetzen.
Ein leider aufgegebenes Spiel mit gutem Konzept. Sehr schade.","I really like the game's concept, but unfortunately, nothing has been done with it beyond the basics.
The game hasn't received any updates for over two years and probably never will again. It's unfinished, and you can see that at every turn.
Dwellers can take on various ""professions"" and perform the corresponding tasks. Each character has different skills in these professions and improves over time in their assigned profession. Unfortunately, almost everything feels extremely clunky, from building to expanding to ""fighting.""
The combat is in quotation marks for a reason: You can essentially assign residents the role of police, but unfortunately, those without professional experience act extremely stupidly. When enemies come, they often run there and do absolutely nothing.
There are few rooms with even less equipment, and a large base offers (at least in my opinion) more disadvantages than advantages. You gain new residents very slowly. Nevertheless, the base must offer sufficient space for the growing crew. Nevertheless, even on the easy maps, you ultimately never have enough personnel to staff everything in a reasonable number.
A sadly abandoned game with a good concept. A real shame."

Not to mention people get bullied for liking their own posts and these guys recommended their own butchered project.

I am also well aware of Spacebase DF-9's troubled development and reputation as the quintessential example of a consumer-unfriendly kickstarter failure.

So why did I pick up this game?  It was dirt cheap on sale and, in theory, it contains many elements of a game that I should enjoy.  Base construction, resource and personnel management, quirky characters to enlist or engage- all wrapped up in a sci-fi setting.  I was expecting that it would be an incomplete experience good for a couple of hours of play with no worthwhile end-game.

""Incomplete"" doesn't even begin to describe this disaster of a game.  The UI is unintuitive.  The AI is incompetent.  The QA is nonexistent.

Whilst I love the idea ant the early game seems polished it just stops there. There pretty much is no mid or end game because once you got al rooms there is no more to see.

Also the combat is not rewarding. One cannot gain anything from it but the risk of losing a guy is really high so i always kept away from combat situations. Also the combat is pretty boring since one can only tell the minions a rough direction which they capture and defend themself.

Never figured out how to do science even tho I had the room, the machines and a scientist. Ugh.
One never really needs the science anyway since everything can be archieved using the lvl 1 machinery that one can build from the start. Mostly i never needed to build a second lvl 1 machine for my needs.

Then people assigned jobs, don't do their needed tasks and get stuck talking to someone, doctors don't clear up corpses or attend people in airlocks, stopping everyone from entering or exiting. Their's no way to urge someone to do a specific task other than assign them a vocation and hope they know what to do. The security team kept going to a derelict with an alien enemy on board that kept killing them even though I'd cancelled the security tag and not claimed any areas. Then the doctor went over there to get the corpses..... It didn't end well.

All in all, this game is a frustrating mess, half the time you're just sat watching people trying to do a task that you have no power over but you know how to solve it and what dangers are there. The other half you're trying to assign people jobs that won't make them throw a tantrum and trash the only airlock while raiders are entering your base through the bedroom and killing people while they sleep. 

Don't buy it, look somewhere else for your gaming needs.","I got this game in a sale for next to nothing and had some hope for it as a space base management sim. Unfortunately the AI is awful and the mechanics for raiders and derelict ships are awful. The first time I played I managed to get 2 rooms made, an airlock constructed and everything needed for people to survive only for the first person to enter the airlock and glitch out, meaning that everyone else couldn't get inside and they all died. Great (sarcasm).

I knew there were some bugs in the game. But that did not stop be from trying this game.

I even tried path 1.07 and 1.08, but I could not see any improvement.
I liked playing the game, but I'm very sad that because of the bugs I cannot progress in the game.

The idea and gameplay of this game are awesome.
It's something I miss in the gaming community, there are only a few games like this.
If all the bugs were fixed, this game would match all those before it.

Some bugs I encountered:
- AI stuck in air lock (to fix this restart the game)
- New crew keeps floating in space until they run out of air (restarting the game doesn't help)
- In 1.08 the security teams do not follow orders

Also the events in the game are pretty random, like in FTL.
I choose a location with very low chance of raiders. At one time my base was devastated. Took some time to fix a lot of things. Then 3 raider ships showed up simultaniously, finishing the rest of my base.

I also did not like that most of the crew were not attending their duties.
Instead they chat, exercise, sleep or just idle (maybe a bug).

Because of all of the above, the base is not making much progress. My base usually gets destroyed by raiders.
My crew usually dies because of the suffocation bug or are killed by raiders

Things I miss in the game:
- turn off raiders option
- save slots
- difficulty setting

Неудачный продукт раннего доступа, который недоделанным выпустили в полноценный релиз. Итак, перед нами эдакий ""Sims"" в космическом пространстве. Выбираем место в галактике, каждое из которых отличается некоторыми факторами заданных значений и отправляемся строить базу и выживать. Изначально у нас в наличии только несколько строителей и кончающийся кислород, но путем постройки объектов мы сможем создать условия для выживания. Только проблемы не будут оставлять ни на минуту, на базе будет все время что-то кончаться и ломаться, да и угроза из космоса будет стучаться в двери каждую минуту. Приправим все это тупейшим искусственным интеллектом персонажей, которые будут девать не всегда логические, а порою вообще абсурдные поступки. Сюжета в игре нет, конечной цели тоже... Строимся, выживаем, начинаем заново. Скучно проводить время в недоделанной игре, которую представляют как полноценный продукт. Не рекомендую.

A failed early access product that was released unfinished. So, what we have here is a kind of ""Sims"" in outer space. We choose a location in the galaxy, each with its own set of factors, and set out to build a base and survive. Initially, we have only a few builders and dwindling oxygen, but by constructing objects, we can create conditions for survival. However, problems will never cease: something at the base will constantly run out and break, and the threat from outer space will be knocking on the door every minute. Add to this the stupid AI of the characters, who will make decisions that are not always logical, and sometimes downright absurd. There is no plot in the game, nor is there an end goal... We build, survive, and start over. It's boring to spend time in an unfinished game that is presented as a fully-fledged product. I do not recommend it.

Ein richtig spannendes Konzept: eine Raumstation auf- und ausbauen, die aus Humanoiden und Aliens bestehende Crew bei Laune halten, Aufgaben zuweisen, Vorlieben berücksichtigen, sie bei Laune halten, Kontakt mit vorbeifliegenden Schiffen herstellen, Verteidigungsanlagen einrichten. Klingt alles sehr spannend, komplex und spaßig.

Der Aufbau beginnt mit dem Planen von Räumen und Gängen. In diese werden dann lebensnotwendige Gerätschaften wie Generatoren oder Sauerstoffumwandler gesetzt, Betten und Regale für die Crewräume, Luftschleusen, Nahrungsspender, Gärten oder auch Fitnessgeräte.

Das große Problem: dem Game fehlt es nicht nur an Feinschliff, es ist schlichtweg nicht fertig. Bugs sind an der Tagesordnung. Rasch bemerkt man, daß der Content nicht gerade umfangreich zu nennen ist, das Gameplay wird schnell repetetiv und ermüdend. 

Schon im Tutorial tauchen absurde Fehler auf. Auch wenn man gefordertes gebaut hat, bleibt die Meldung, die einen zum Bau auffordert, noch vorhanden und das in ganzer Bildschirmbreite: Oder die Crew baut in Raumanzügen den Boden eines Raumes fertig und findet dann den Weg zurück in die Luftschleuse nicht mehr. Absurd unfertig, Gamebraker an jeder Ecke, selbst als Alpha wäre es nicht akzeptabel. Und Double Fine erklärt so etwas einfach als fertig und verkauft diesen Gamestumpf immer noch zum ansehnlichen Preis.

Es gibt inzwischen zwar von den Usern erstellte Fixes, die zumindest die übelsten Fehler beheben, das sollte aber die Aufgabe der Firma sein und bleiben, die dieses unfertige Etwas auf den Markt geworfen hat.

Spacewaste Did not Finish-9

[h1][b]DNF/10 Gesamtwertung","""Spacebase DF-9"" is a space station construction and crew management game. And one that was simply canceled mid-development.

A truly exciting concept: building and expanding a space station, keeping the crew, consisting of humanoids and aliens, happy, assigning tasks, taking their preferences into account, maintaining contact with passing ships, and setting up defense systems. It all sounds very exciting, complex, and fun.

The construction begins with the planning of rooms and corridors. Vital equipment such as generators or oxygen converters, beds and shelves for the crew quarters, airlocks, food dispensers, gardens, and even fitness equipment are then placed in these.

The big problem: the game not only lacks polish, it's simply not finished. Bugs are commonplace. You quickly notice that the content isn't exactly extensive, and the gameplay quickly becomes repetitive and tedious.

Even in the tutorial, absurd errors appear. Even after you've built what's required, the message prompting you to build remains, stretching across the entire screen. Or the crew, in spacesuits, finishes building the floor of a room and then can't find their way back to the airlock. Absurdly unfinished, with game breakers everywhere; even as an alpha, it wouldn't be acceptable. And Double Fine simply declares something like this finished and still sells this game stump at a respectable price.

While there are now user-created fixes that at least address the worst bugs, that should be and remain the responsibility of the company that released this unfinished thing.

However... There is yet, a glimmer of hope. Now, it's no secret that this game is riddled with bugs, and malfunctioning features.

It fixes -many- of the game-breaking bullsh!t that plagued the game, and even adds some additional features. It's easy to find via the game's forum page, for any who are interested.

So in my opinion, with that patch, the game is worth a try. Don't like it? Refund it. I find it extremely fun, with some very unique mechanics and concepts that I've never seen elsewhere. The promise that this game had was immense. It's very obvious that, before they decided to run away with the cash, the Devs were being extremely creative when making this game.

I played the early versions of the game, and having recently picked it up again, I see no difference, no new features, no bug fixes... In other words, no progress between the beginning and the so-called ""final"" version.

In short, I'm totally disappointed with what Double Fine has done with this game, even though they've accustomed us to better. There are other, more interesting and advanced management games out there, and I recommend looking elsewhere to avoid wasting your time."

Spacebase DF-9 is a survival game in the wide-reaching void of, you guessed it, space. Your mission is work with a trio of astronauts and build the most sophisticated, comprehensive and long-lasting space station anyone has ever seen. That sounds amazing on paper, and being developed from the veterans over at Double Fine Productions, you’d almost be assured a great game. However, the product falls short and development has long since died for this title, leaving an ugly mess in its wake. In space, nobody can hear you complain.

The game opens up with an interesting concept at first – a map laid out with all the locations in the galaxy, letting you pick where you want to start and factoring in variables like meteor showers, derelict ships, traffic for earning more crew members [good and bad] and resources. Once your base is selected, you’re launched into space with three crew members, a space pod for power and oddly, no spaceship; the game starts you out in the dead of space with limited oxygen, limited supplies and a very short time span before your whole crew perishes from asphyxiation. From a logical standpoint, the start of the game makes absolutely no sense and it only gets worse from there.

You must quickly build a functioning center with enough life support for your crew. You’ll gather material from nearby asteroids that oddly resemble play-doh, which you will ingeniously craft into oxygen recyclers and stations for power with nothing but a blowtorch and your wits. As the base grows, you’re able to expand, making different rooms that can be retrofitted into housing, laboratories, pubs, infirmaries and more. 

I like the aspect of building a base to my own liking, but Double Fine really chokes the life out of personalizing it as you see fit: limited items to use, each room can only use furniture from one list of items [I.E. only residential furniture in a residence] which forces you to build a lot of unnecessary rooms for no reason at all. However, my biggest complaint is being in space and not being able to build along the Z axis; you can only build outward, not vertically, which seems like a huge oversight since you’re not hindered by the laws of gravity.

As you continue playing, you’ll encounter hazards that you must overcome, such as illness, resource management [marginally], machine repairs, raiders [space pirates] and meteor showers. Most obstacles aren’t all that exciting: meteor showers are not impressive and barely noticeable if the game didn’t tell you it was happening, space pirates have terrible AI capabilities and can easily be killed with a few well-placed defense turrets and most ailments can be cured by simply sending them to the doctor, curing them nearly instantly. Oddly, some of the ailments have auto-cures, such as when I was afflicted with “Space Blindness”, which I was promptly told there was already a cure so I didn’t have to do anything.

The real gem to this travesty is the writing, or the lack of a proper writer. Here’s an example of the type of “communications” you’ll received while in space:

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=834694128

I felt secondhand embarrassment just reading it. The writing is dreadful, out of place and just downright terrible. Couple that with other gems like my dead astronaut having a “kinda happy” job satisfaction while simultaneously being dead, but the real winner is that her location is “space”:

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=834702535

Yes, everything in this game has ""space"" attached to it. Your location, beds are called ""space beds"" and even rugs are called ""space rugs"" because your typical Ikea rug is not suitable for the vacuum of space apparently.

I could go on and on with all the issues with this game, but in the end it has been abandoned completely by Double Fine and is left at the hands of 3rd party modders if they feel like investing their time in such a project. Much like my crew member Nashira Corrino, this game is dead, asphyxiated by its own mediocrity.

This game, given another year in development, could have been good. But the alpha version you get here is really frustrating to play:

- Only one saved game at a time, and auto save only. So if anything goes wrong, that's all your time wasted.

- Quite often when raiding a derelict (which should be a fun thing to do), oxygen levels will drop for no reason and kill all your guys.

- A single raider can easily kill way too many of your experienced guys. Even in areas that are meant to have low threat levels and even when your guys are firing back (and because of AI bugs, sometimes they don't).

- I've not noticed any difference in the threat level of the main map, because I can get raided once in an hour in a high area, and almost once a minute in a low area. It makes no sense and feels like the map rating wasn't connected to anything.

- The AI has serious flaws, the most irritating of which is where your security team WILL JUST STAND there and get killed. Even 10 highly trained guys will stand right next to a raider and let themselves all be killed. There is also a bug where they get confused and refused to enter the base to regain oxygen, eventually dying.

- You can't tell your guys to leave an area, which means that once you own a derelict it becomes a magnate for guys and raiders which is no end of trouble. For instance, When raiders retake a derelict, technicians and doctors will all float over and get killed. I know an emergency switch is used for this, but derelicts don't come with any.

- You can't pan when in the building menu, which means you have to start all over again if the camera isn't perfect.

- You can view oxygen levels, but not power levels, and is seems power units need to be close enough to power things. So you have to guess where power is going.

- Oxygen leaks are impossible to spot sometimes if a ****ing raider blows out a wall that's not in an obvious spot. The O2 overlay needs to show leak spots.

- Sometime when building a new base, oxygen recyclers don't work.

There's enough game here that would be worth checking out if it were free. BUT, because this isn't on early access I can't recommend spending any money on it. There's just WAY too many game breaking flaws that end up ruining your time. 

The fact Double Fine thought it was OK to continue to charge money for such a broken game, and with no plans to fix any of it, they get a BIG F.U from me.

28662138,english,2016.11.26 11:32,✅,✅,0.464509666,2,"This game gets an 8/10 from me. It's a really relaxing game when taken for what it is. I am reviewing it as version 1.06 Mac OSX no mods installed. I had a free version for months before finding it on steam for 99¢ and just had to buy it to encourage the developers just a little bit with my tiny contribution. I would easily pay $5 bucks for it.

You're basically thrown into space, given 3 guys and very little resources to start building your space base. In the beginning you need to start as small as possible, building just the bare necessities. Once you have a small (3x3) airlock room, another room just large enough to hold 3 oxygen recyclers, and a room just large enough for a matter refinery, the rest is a piece of cake.

The game is 90% relaxing, mining and building, welcoming new (weird & silly) inhabitants, and pretty much trying to keep everyone fed, breathing, and happy - or as happy as one can be in a fragile domicile in space. You need to begin early considering how to protect your base from bad guys that pop in periodically, and asteroid impact damages.

Aside from the few (easy) dangers, it's just a relaxing sandbox style building game where you can be creative in making a space base to be proud of. The interface is pretty much well organized, which is an aspect that many games like this get wrong. I enjoy the weird types of characters/aliens and their thoughts and interactions.

Many people complain about the AI being retarded, but you have to pay attention to what each character is good or bad at and by what degree they would suck at a job. You have to assign them to duties they are good at and actually enjoy doing. Some are good at a job, but hate doing it, so yeah, they'll stand around playing games on their pads instead of doing any work, unless you assign them to a duty they enjoy. I find this aspect completely adorable, as it really adds to the immersion and how you feel or care for each individual. I also love the names - imagining how an alien would pronounce his name written as ""Uneekly (nicely)"" - that sorta thing.

It's currently (for the past several months) been my favorite game for when I just want to relax and make a creative little space base. The few, easy dangers add just enough of that random aspect to keep you on your toes and influence the shape and direction your base takes. Have lots of good tech guys and your base will run smoothly - put lotsa gun turrets all around the outside walls and you'll be safe enough to survive a large attack that eventually happens. And just have fun building and watching how your inhabitants get along.

My only complaint is - once you get a VERY LARGE base, things go bad fast. Machines start failing, catching on fire, destroying themselves everywhere, no matter how many techs you have to fix them. But I guess this is just a sign that I've gone way too far with this base and should just start a new one, haha.

28320630,english,2016.11.12 06:36,✅,✅,0.5592286587,3,"I like this game, simple, dumb.  It lacks a lot of items, randomized events, and it's most likely when you really need an action taken like saving an incapacitated crew member, or fight back against enemies you are going to lose.  That is pretty much it, three things you have to deal with.  Bad A.I. that are stupid and the events of ships coming and going being either new crew or raiders, that's all.

This is, sort of worth the price but sort of not, since it still plays like alphaware (even fan-patched, you want to do that) If it's on sale like $4.99 (or free/bundled cheap/$1) I think it's worth just a few hours of play if you want a really dumb space simulator that is pretty much rogue-lite if you don't absolutely micro like a mo-fo against any early first 15 minute rage quits.  I followed all the hype and bad blood and finally sitting down with it, (had it for awhile) I really like it.  If there was one thing I'd like added it would be abit more control with your crew, rather then somewhat bad hit/miss pathfinding and que actions. Like at least make one crew promoted to Captain and you at least can do everything on your own seperately and remotely while everyone else just does their business.

Like I said, it's a more unforgiving repetitive rogue-lite experience with either very bland gameplay or very frenetic broken attacks and your crew just being dumb.  It won't be this sim that is easy or, hey build a base with hundreds of items beautiful space life thing.  The gameplay is somewhat vapid, and a bit weak in a few areas but to me it was okay for what it is, regardless of any pie in the sky promises.  I've certainly played far worse games that cost more and games that truly are shovelware/abandonware.  It isn't going to be evil genius, or dwarves, or even rimworld.  It's okay for an unfinished game.  Believe me, there are much much worse out there.  Out of 5 I'd give this game a 3.  Out of 10, I'd give it a 5.  Out of 3 I'd give it a 1.5

You send a guy to a derilict and he dies, go send a builder to vape a few walls and kill everything inside.  You got miners/builders outside about to be attacked, switch to guards.  Use the alarms/beacons.  Put sentry guns everywhere, build air/power and research.  Then build.  That's about it, build another base layout, then another base layout. Most of all, get this game as cheap as possible.  Not more then $4.99 and certainly $1 is a bargain for you to waste an hour or 2 just to see how rediculous your crew will act.  They will leave crew to die on the floor with broken knees no matter how many doctors you have, they will fly around outside and do like one action and return with 7 mins of oxygen.  When the crew does work it makes you happy, when they all leap out the airlock to die like lemmings... well... ya, it pisses you off.","I like this game, simple, dumb.

Two years after its release, it remains littered with bugs that devastate its playability. I am reccommending it because for what it costs, I think you're getting your money's worth.

This game is very screwy. You've been sent deep into the galaxy to help seed the remnants of human civilization throughout space after the fall of Earth. You're not alone, you get help from nearby strangers in similar situations. You never get to actually take control of anything though, the people do whatever they want and all you can do it provide some guidance. More often than not, succeeding involves less strategy and skill, but simply getting lucky.

With that said, I've been having fun with it. There isn't a whole lot to the game. I really wish they would finish it, or perhaps publish it open source so we could develope it further, because it has enormous potential to be an exceptionally entertaining experience.

If you get it, you're going to notice a few problems right away. There are almost no settings. I think you can basically turn the sound on or off and that's it. The game's artwork is quite simplistic and usually runs smoothly, but the HUD menues are overloaded with special effects and animations that will make your framerate drop to crap any time they open. Once you've done the tutorial level and are ready to actually play the game, you may spend more time just looking for a decent place on the galaxy map to build your base than the time you spend actually getting to play. The whole game then gets quite confounded by the mood mechanics. While there are things you can do to help people be happier, and I've had lots of happy folks in some of my bases, they all inevitably gravitate towards depression and then stop working and everything goes to crap and the oxygen runs out and they all suffocate.

Once you get to that point, you discover that there is no way to actually loose the game! Even with everyone dead and your base in ruins, you can still get new people on random chance and continue playing, even though they are almost certainly doomed.

The whole game is wacky that way. It makes a whole lot of no sense. But, still, it's fun, somehow. As long as you don't think abut it too hard or take it too seriously, building one base after another while being hounded by pirates and metoeor showers and ocasionally having some suicidal idiot walk out the wrong door and drift away into space can be pleasantly amusing.

Это суровая игра, после 9 часов игры и развития ко мне на базу попал рейдер, причём зашёл он в незащищённый шлюз и выпилил всё моё оборудование и базу. Я решил начать заново, однако на сей раз мои жители взгрустнули и один парень впал в ""бешенство"" и пока его ловили, ко мне на базу зашли рейдеры в новенький шлюз, куда не поставили ещё турель и я вернулся снова к тому же концу с выпиливанием половины базы. Опыт ""dwarf fortress"" говорил, что история базы всегда служит лулзом, и на сей раз я выбрал сектор с low-threat, и залез в отзывы об игре. В большинстве случаев они отрицательные, и мой бы отзыв был отрицательным, если бы не тяга к приключениям. Один огромный минус, что я заметил, так это то, что не всё, что обещали разработчики вошло в игру, и за это мне было очень грустно.
Однако игра представляет из себя сложный симулятор базы, почему он сложный? Да всё потому что он не доделанный! Я немного не понял пока, как кроме профессии, бара, качалки и полок улучшить настроение людей, а это практически самое главное, так как допустим, что его друга убили, и да, этот человек получает статус - sad. Кроме рустера практически не существует возможности как-то скрасить их печаль, и в итоге либо рейдеры, либо безумец на базе. Выбора мало, даже паразиты убиваются легче, чем рейдеры. Я думаю попробовать сыграть ещё пару раз, и на сей раз я поставлю турели на базу, чтобы продолжить игру, а не смотреть, как твою базу кто-то выносит. И я упомянул паразитов! Здесь они могут иметь такой же масштаб, как в фильме чужой, т.е. вы холите и лелеяте жителя, и тут паразит!

По шкале удовольствия эта игра всё же заслужила от меня положительный отзыв, хотя есть много огрехов в этой игре.","So, I bought this game in Early Access – it was fun, but I recently decided to give it a serious go, thanks to my vacation. It's a tough game. After nine hours of playing and progressing, a raider got into my base, entered through an unprotected gateway, and wiped out all my equipment and the base. I decided to start over, but this time my villagers were sad, and one guy went berserk. While they were catching him, raiders entered my base through a brand new gateway, where they hadn't yet installed a turret, and I was back to the same ending with half the base wiped out. My experience with ""Dwarf Fortress"" told me that a base's story always serves as a lulz, so this time I chose a low-threat sector and checked the game's reviews. They were mostly negative, and my review would have been negative if not for my thirst for adventure. One huge downside I noticed was that not everything the developers promised made it into the game, and that made me very sad.
However, the game is a complex base simulator. Why is it complex? It's because it's unfinished! I haven't quite figured out how, other than professions, bars, gyms, and shelves, I can improve people's moods. This is practically the most important thing, since, say, a friend gets killed, and yes, that person gets the ""sad"" status. Besides a Rooster, there's practically no way to brighten their sadness, and ultimately, it's either raiders or a madman in the base. There's little choice; even parasites are easier to kill than raiders. I'm thinking of trying a couple more times, and this time I'll put turrets on the base so I can continue the game instead of watching someone destroy your base. And did I mention parasites? Here, they can be as big as in the movie Alien, meaning you're nurturing and cherishing a villager, and then a parasite appears!

On the enjoyment scale, this game still earned a positive review from me, although there are many flaws in this game."

Wie ich verstanden habe wird es aber nicht öffentlich weiter entwickelt. Jedoch finden sich auch hier in der Community Webseiten auf denen es inoffizielle Patches gibt. 
Es ist noch viel Arbeit nötig um es zu einem guten funktionieren zu bringen.

Was ich genauer damit meine ist: 

die Wegführung (so bauen sich meine Kolonisten Regelmässig selbst ein, gehen Wege die mir nicht einleuchten zu Luftschleusen die weiter Weg vom Ziel liegen oder laufen/schweben Sturheil in ihren Untergang)

die Möglichkeit Bereiche zu Sperren (dies korrespondiert mit dem obigen Punkt) Ich habe unzählige Kolonisten verloren weil sie meinten auf ein Derelikt zu müssen um Sachen einzusammeln. Wenn dieser noch nicht von Feinden befreit ist werden sie niedergeschossen. Oder es kommen so viele nach einem Gefecht das die Luft knapp wird, sie in Panik verfallen und die Luftschleuse untätig wird. Das waren SEHR frustrierende Momente.

Grafikprobleme durch Flackern und ausfallen der Beleuchtungen was die Räume von ihrer Farbgebung nicht mehr unterscheidbar machte.

Und trotzdem habe ich viele Stunden damit Zugebracht mich der Angriffe zu erwehren, Gehinrparasiten zu untersuchen und meine Station immer größer werden zu lassen. Für einen Abend ist es eine nette Abwechslung und man sollte die Modder und Inoffiziellen Entwickler weiter im Auge behalten.
","Well, what can one say about this game?
As far as I understand, it's not being publicly developed. However, there are also websites in the community where there are unofficial patches.
A lot of work still needs to be done to get it working properly.

What I mean more specifically is:

The route guidance (my colonists regularly build themselves, take paths I don't understand to airlocks that are far from the target, or stubbornly walk/float to their doom)

The ability to block off areas (this corresponds to the point above). I've lost countless colonists because they thought they had to climb a derelict to collect items. If it isn't cleared of enemies yet, they get shot down. Or so many arrive after a battle that they run out of air, panic, and the airlock stops working. Those were VERY frustrating moments.

Graphical issues caused by flickering and lighting failures made the rooms indistinguishable from their color schemes.

And yet, I spent many hours fending off attacks, examining brain parasites, and growing my station. It's a nice change of pace for an evening, and you should keep an eye on the modders and unofficial developers.

But then Double-Fine decided to say ""F--- You"" to everyone and stopped working on it.

So, basically, here is what you have, in clever bulletpoints:
-Buggy AI akin to the Sims without the instinct for survival. Your colonists could very well die of asphyxiation if you forget to stop them from doing whatever they were doing
-a faction-based territory system that barely works, where you could very well f--- up the enemy base if you just dismantle a wall or a door while they attempt to invade you. This causes strange bugs all around.
-Limited space and resources, you mostly end up relying on the so-called enemy invasions to dismantle their clutter so you can have anything, at a later point in the game.

It's an interesting micromanagement survival game, and a challenging one at that, but it became so buggy and out of control that I couldn't see myself play any longer each session. Plus it seems Double Fine deemed this game a dud, and stopped working on it. Wrong move, guys. Finish your games before calling it quits.","I bought this game so long ago.

I think my biggest gripe with Spacebase DF-9 is the amount of constant events that pop up that will either give citizens, matter or hostiles and some of these you have no choice but to accept. With these though it runs into the problem of keeping these new citizens alive and happy as your Oxygen Generators can only sustain a certain amount of people and you may only have enough facilities to sustain what you've built for.

The game will constantly try to push you to a higher population cap, it becomes more of a race to keep up then a relaxing experience, even worse the game will punish you if you try to ""control"" the population by stressing all of your citizens out and pushing them closer to brawling and killing each other. It all tries to reach critical mass and as soon as your last citizen drops it's game over.

My first playthrough went fine, pretty basic management fare but then a raider showed up and I discovered that the 'security' crew assignments I'd made meant people couldn't last two seconds against the lone raider..
Alright then, it was the first go and in tutorial so I can accept an hours play lost and decided to start a new game.

First realisation, there was no ""this will erase your data"" or ""do you want to save"" warning. Surprising and not great, but as said, I hadn't planned to anyway so I went ahead with a new real start.

My hopes for the game returned, I enjoyed starting anew and building up the base and this time I had a plan for raiders!
My plan... reassign every crewmen to security and overwhelm in numbers! XD
Not great I know.. but it worked, though highly tiresome to have to remember and reassign everyone back to their old jobs as you can't assign saved positions to default back to.
Then of course, things went bad again...

I find a derelict ship, so badly laid out it could've been a rushed post-battle vessel from Galaxy Truckers.
So of course, I decide to tear everything out as salvage materials.
Unknown to me, one crew decided to remove the ships oxegen generator and then the door of another room from the inside.. leaving him stuck and likely gormless, as there was no notification of him being stuck.

I'll admit a possibly mistake on my part: Not painstakingly watching and assigning each item removed one at a time, but when I tried that previously the crew had a habit of just heading off to bed or returning to my base for a minute to build some shelves I'd requested another builder to build, before coming back.. which is why this time I just left them to it.

Anyway, I found Mr.Gormless and got him to let himself out of the room but before he got any further the oxegen in the ship got too low and it turns out people panic when they realise the oxegen is low (fair enough I'm sure).
Unfortunately, this panic was apparently too much to allow the builder to obey my orders to rebuild an oxegen generator.
Close to frustration I see my second builder heading over in a space suit to save the day..

Unfortunately, Gormlessness is clearly contagious as our superhero stepped out of the airlock, went into a panic himself, rushed back into the airlock and flushed himself into space...

So yea, there you have it. My adventures in Spacebase DF-9. I advise you against having any of your own.","I quite loved the potential for this game, but in practise it is horribly disapponting!

However, there is a new mod called ""unoffical patch"" to fix some bugs and add some features. I recommend you download that mod or be greeted with bugs apocalypse. 

Now lets talk gameplay.

Unfortunately, you can't move your people, which can be very annoying when raiders are on sight.
You can assign them up to 9 jobs, some people are more skilled on certain job and also enjoy/hate certain job.
The jobs are;
Builder: self explanatory 
Technician: maintain and fixes objects
Miner: self explanatory
Security: shoot hostile enemy, and follow security beacon that you can set.
Bartender: Tends the bar which increase happiness.
Botanist: tends the garden.
Scientist: Make researches to unlock things.
Doctor: Heal and cure diseases/illness
Janitor: Clean corpses
Unassigned: default

People have needs, and they can go up and down shown on a graph. I don't know what most of these does to the person.
Duty, Social, Morale, Stuff, Energy, Hunger, Fun. Those are the 7 needs of a person.

People also have ""thoughts"" that you can read. Some of them are about friends and enemy they made, an object they built, or even a certain doom they are about to encounter. Thoughts really define them and I enjoy pausing the game and reading them. 
They also have a nice hand drawn avatar so you know what they look like and perks, if they have low self esteem or they are anxious, etc.

Each person really is different from the rest and it's amazing how much detail they have. It's ashamed this game is abandoned.

Now let's talk about building.
There are 13 rooms you can build, and they are;
Airlock: In and out of the space station
Life Support: For placing Oxygen machine 
Reactor: for powering the entire space station
Refinery: smelting rocks into matter (money)
Residence: Build beds to increase population limit
Pub: increase happiness
Garden: Grow food
Fitness: gym
Research: build research table for scientist
Infirmary: Hospital
Brig: prison
Command: Threat monitoring
Unzoned: plain old room 
Each of these rooms have certain objects that can only be placed on that room. All objects (and wall/floor) cost matter to build.
Matter can be obtained by mining rocks and smelting it on a refinery machine. 

To build a room, you need to inclosed it with walls and floors. If a wall or a floor is destroyed, and a person is in that room, they will be sucked into the vacume of space and die.
Walls/floors and objects can be destroyed from astroids and raiders. 

There are random encounter in the game.
There are people that you can communicate with that randomly pops up (when they are near you).
If you respond to their message, then you can either gain a person or be targeted by raiders.
This is the risk you need to think about before accepting their calls.
There are also an actual spaceship that shows in your game. You can either send your security (via security beacon) or leave it alone until it leaves the game.

To put it simply, the game is really, really hard, because the AI is awful and the game hardly gives you a chance to recover from one raider attack to the next.

I saw a game with potential and I was all and all hopeful.  In those ealier days the game was riddled with bugs and glitches, and when I found out they were dropping the game and rushing development, I was hopeful they would eliminate those bugs and glitches in the game.  So as a review of the official release of version 1.06 here is the breakdown.  I'll have a simple review and more in depth... or in this game... anger driven review...

----- Simple ----

The game is crap... It had so much potential but since it got the axe and a speedy release... it has so many issues.  I honestly tried to play the game again... but yet I wasn't able to play longer than 10 minues.  I would not recommend this game to anybody unless it's less than a dollar or given to you free.  It's buggy... rough to control, and just honestly crap.

----- Angered Version -----

Graphics:
As this is not a ""Highly graphical"" game I wouls say they are acceptable.  The sprites perform actions that is befiting, and nothing to standoutish.  However in aspect of gameplay the ""isometric"" angle makes the game difficult to know exactly what is going on.  In the typical fashion the walls disappear in a way to allow you to see in the rooms, however being able to roatate the camera would be nice.

Gameplay:
This is where the game loses me.  Although the controls aren't ""hard"" they are difficult in there own way.  I've played many builder games, and most games play similarily with minor adjustments to the controls.  In more recent terms since the era of shooter games almost every game depends upon the W-A-S-D model.  This game doesn't stray too far fram that idea and it feels comfortable... at least until you start building.  At that point the game takes a turn for the worst.  Edge scrolling doesn't feel like it's in existence, so your dependant upon the WASD model, but once you open the construction menu, foul language fills the mouth as when you click with your mouse to select the item and press ""D"" to move your contruction item changes.  As soon as that construction menu comes up the game shifts from a comfortable WASD model to a point and click model.  This wouldn't be a problem if they didn't establish you could use the WASD in the first place....   So that is annoying.  Then it gets worse.  As you play you decide to speed up the game, and most games using some button near the WASD (tab, 123, something) changes the game speed, but in comes the mouse model, and you have to click the speed options.  Now I wouldn't have an issue with this, if it wasn't for the fact that when any ship arrived or any notification appears the game switches back to speed 1.... and DOES NOT RETURN.....I find it quite annoying because I'll be in the middle of waiting for my characters to build a room... then all the sudden a message... then the question, ""Why are my guys moving so slow""... then oh gotta click that speed... then the game goes NOPE... and another message.  It just continually pesteres you until you get so angry that you give up.

AI:
I don't normally judge AI as it's always an issue with all games.  It is always about finding that right balance between what the computer needs to process and what the character prioritizes.... unfortunately it appears that this game said, ""F*$k it... have the guys do whatever.""  And like loyal programs they do whatever.  You have absolutely no control over the individual character, so when your trying to finish that bed... your have to wait until the game decides... ""know what I think I should build that bed.""  But at that point your characters are now falling over because they are so tired... that they have no energy... then get depressed and not want to work... so now that bed will never get done.... it annoying the bleeping crap out of me as I was just trying to enjoy the game.

Glitches and Bugs:
Yes I'm bringing it up... as a ""fully"" released game you would expect most of the bugs and glitches to be taken care of... in fact thats what most of the follow up forums established... but know what.... turns out that your characters get stuck (dumb AI) and because you can't do that they sufficate.... yeah... so just started finished the basic build... airlock... air... and such... but oh no... two of my guys just sat there... doing... NOTHING... could it be AI? probably... but to me that's a bug.   But it's not the worst oh no... in my honest to goodness no opinion try I got ""invaded"" another ship attached itself to me, and I was assulted.  After killing the AI I noticed, Hey there is a gun outside...  Then I slowly watched one of my security guards go out to take care of it.... two shots later dead.... ok..... so what does the AI do?  ""Well he's dead... probably should take care of that... but naa....""  Guess where my miners had to go to get resources?  Right in the line of fire.... so there goes two of my miners...  Well maybe I can control a security... oh wait can't control the guys so whoops... maybe set a security point for them.... nope... dead... dead and dead.....  I'm happy they incorperated the guns for defences... but when a gun is established as enemy and even if you took over everything it appears that that guns still acts hostile....  My frustrations knows no bounds.

Overall the game is fine.... just fine.... not great... not good... just fine.... if you want something new to distract you for 10 minutes... here is the perfect game for you... but don't buy unless it's on uber sale.... and by uber sale like... I dunno $0.99 per copy... or heck maybe if the company pays you to play... becuase honestly this game isn't worth anything more.","Dissapointing....

There are some ""goals"" to be accomplished, but i don't really think it's that important, or maybe the game doesn't really show it as important.

Pros:
- Lots of items and room variations to build
- You can assign your resident to do various jobs and raise their experience

Cons:
- Assigning a bed to each person one by one can be very tiring, especially if you have a lot of residents.
- No ""undo"" button after doing a construction ""blueprint""
- No rotate button

Так ещё и всё равно ""нагревать"" игроков платными DLC. Отсюда мы имеем то, что имеем. Поэтому игроки и ""хватаются"" за интересные игры, пусть они и на стадии разработки, надеясь на лучшее. Верикт: не покупать ни в коем случае.","I bought the game back in 2014. It had great potential, to say the least. Incidentally, for those who don't know, DF is a reference to Dwarf Fortress. It was fascinating to imagine what the game would become in the future. Ultimately, the game is still unfinished. It's yet another product, of which there are countless now, that has ""sold"" those (myself included) who bought it in the alpha stage. Let me speculate a bit, if you'll allow me. The fact is, the gaming industry doesn't allow for the full range of genres it once did. It's hard to imagine a submarine simulator, for example, being commercially successful. Game production is becoming increasingly expensive, so it makes sense to release only CoD every year—a product aimed at the largest possible player base. And then, of course, keep enticing players with paid DLC. That's why we have what we have. That's why players grab interesting games, even if they're still in development, hoping for the best. Verdict: don't buy them under any circumstances."

Spacebase DF9 has a nice idea and a rather decent realisation. The gameplay is all right, and the design, particularly of the inhabitants of the space station, is pretty cool. BUT. The game has been abandoned by the devs and currently relies on community patches to work. Don't expect any fixes for the bugs that are still in the game.

What is there is the groundwork for the Sims in space. Sort of. You're starting out with three astronauts and a small amount of resources, just enough to build a closed space to shelter your little aliens from, well, actual space. From there, you mine resources, add to your space station room by room, and slowly develop a complex microcosmos that has you manage life-sustaining installations like reactors and oxygen generators, necessities like food dispensers, a medical bay and bedrooms, and luxuries like a bar and a fitness room. Additional challenges include raids and abandoned drifting space stations to discover and loot to your heart's content.

But that's where the content ends. It's a very bare-bones game that gets repetitive fast. The AI is borderline stupid as soon as something goes wrong, with people running around screaming at the tiniest fire instead of using the extinguishers and subsequently letting the entire station burn, others starving to death because the food dispenser was too far away (in the next room), and the doctor preferring to eat five times in a row at said food dispenser instead of incinerating the bodies of those who died in the last pirate raid - who have only died because security idled at the opposite end of the station until I specifically directed them to fight the raiders. You have to micromanage everything, because you can't trust the AI. Even after you assign jobs to people, they will sometimes refuse to do them, even if it's their preferred occupation. Security officers will not intervene unless you tell them to, and then one at a time, getting killed by absurdly overpowered raiders.
Who will always show up as soon as your station hits a certain number of people (ridiculously low, six, if I remember right), and will start out super-strong. Contrary to what the ""map"" selection suggests, there is no way to adjust the difficulty unless you change the game files manually, and even then it often doesn't work. The area of space that you pick has no tangible impact on how hard the game is; the number of raiders and meteor strikes seems consistent across the board, the only thing that changes is how often empty stations drift by yours.
It's crazy hard to survive after hitting the threshold after which raiders spawn, and borderline impossible once you've reached ten and higher because the game keeps spawning higher and higher numbers of enemies, forcing you to assign around half of your inhabitants to security. That, in turn, prevents you from playing a lot of the other features, like botany, which you need for the bar, or science, which you need for almost all upgrades. The balance is shoddy, and Double Fine did not bother to fix it, instead abandoning the game.
Fans have stepped in and created one (to my knowledge, so far) patch to fix a few of these bugs, but there is no guarantee it'll work with your game. And it shouldn't have to, if DF didn't stop working on games once it becomes too much work. It seems like the game didn't sell as many copies as they anticipated, and they decided it wasn't worth the effort, instead starting another crowdfunding campaign for a new game. That looks like a really shady business practice, like you'd find on the seedier side of Greenlight and Early Access, and one I can't support.

this will always keep you on you're toes and usually I try to keep the starting 3 people alive as long a posible and get a like and dislike in people and try to make them happy and thats challaging to keep them happy and alive with all those treaths.

you can play it alot and not get tired of it atleast I can haha.

[b][u]TL;DR [/u][/b]
There is a ton of promise here. When the game is running smooth there’s not a lot to complain about (except maybe lack of construction options), but eventually that smooth ride will be over and you’ll realize nothing works like it should, if at all. So while playable you’ll hit a point where the effort to advance isn’t worth it. If you still think you want to punish yourself by playing this game make sure you check out http://www.spacebasehub.net/ for the unofficial patch, the mechanics are still broken but everything else has been improved.

[b][u]In-depth Review[/u][/b]
[b]Overall Gameplay: [/b]
The basic construction and management section of the game is fairly well done. It’s very similar to “Theme Hospital”, but with a slightly improved interface. That’s where the positives end. So many things are broken that it becomes unnecessarily difficult, and not in a fun, challenging way but in a “oh there’s another thing that doesn’t work right” kind of way. 
Here are just a few examples of things you’ll see characters do:
- Die of suffocation despite being surrounded by rooms with oxygen and having access to an airlock with space suits, 
- Become incapacitated (not dead, just lying around uselessly) indefinitely. If they’re Raiders they actually might be back up and start killing people!
- Be marked for the brig or infirmary but never go there
- Scientists not researching (despite being assigned research and having a research station).
- Ignore the 3 fire extinguishers near the fire, and instead stomp on it until they catch on fire, then run around the base being ignored by everyone else until they burn to death… Actually that might’ve been the most entertaining part of the game!

[b]Presentation:[/b] 
The user interface is easy to navigate but overly simple. You only have 1 save slot and the game auto saves by default, so if you’re not careful it’s quite easy to erase a save game by clicking on the wrong thing and not exiting before it overwrites your game.

The graphics are fine. They’re quite obviously a throwback to “Theme Hospital” (how many times can I name dop?). It works well for the genre, and they’re fairly sharp. 

The sound is outright boring, the music is nothing impressive and off the top of my head I honestly don’t remember any sounds other than that and the chirping alarm if you zoom in far enough.


[b][u]Summary:[/u][/b]
This game could be so good, but as in so many cases now it looks like the developer took their money and ran. In my love/hate relationship with Early Access this is why the hate portion exists. I’d give it a 3/10, it’s playable and as long as things work right it’s quite enjoyable, but the unpredictable and frustrating broken mechanics make it another EA Trash title. Pick it up in a bundle with some good games or for $1 or less and get a couple hours of fun… But DO NOT, under any circumstances pay any more for it than that. Especially when you could get the vastly superior Theme Hospital and forget this all together.","Being a fan of the old “Tycoon” games and “Theme Hospital” I was really excited about Space Base DF-9.

Задумывался данный проект как некая альтернатива знаменитой серии игр Sid Meier's Civilization, но к большому сожалению все пошло немного не так как хотелось. 

Итак, перед нами стоит задача основать колонию в космосе. Создать базу довольно просто, на первый час игры это делается довольно легко (несмотря на постоянные атаки пиратов и метеоритных дождей), но по истечении второго часа начинаешь задумываться: ""А что дальше?"". А ответ оказался прост до безобразия: ""НИЧЕГО!"".

Да к большому моему сожалению эта игра так и осталась в ""Раннем доступе"", хотя и обладала великим потенциалом. Ведь можно было сделать так, что бы развитие одной базы, допустим, происходило в одной ""Солнечной"" системой, и в тот же момент Вы могли бы организовать вторую базу с еще большим потенциалом (по примеру той же Цивилизации, только борьба бы шла не за одну планету, а за определенную часть галактики). Либо же второй вариант: после удачного обоснования в космосе, Вы могли бы колонизировать близлежащую планету, и вот велась бы настоящая борьба за жизнь. Но, как я уже и говорил, моим мечтам не суждено было сбыться.

В целом, игра получилась очень даже хорошая, но как было написано ранее, она попросту незаконченная. Много глюков в игре - это вполне нормальное явление, по крайней мере для бета-теста) Звук довольно приличный. На счет графики хотелось бы сказать, что если Вам нужна игра с хорошим и главное качественным визуальным рядом, то Вам явно не стоит пробовать данный проект. Графика, как для стандартного симулятора-стратегии, довольно таки неплохая, по крайней мере не отталкивает игрока)

По окончании обзора хотелось бы перечислить плюсы и минусы данного проекта.

Плюсы:
+ Очень интересная задумка
+ Графическая составляющая игры на довольно неплохом уровне
+ Звук
+ Геймплей (хоть и прост, но очень удобен)
+ Затягивает (но, к сожалению, не надолго)

Минусы:
- Баги
- Мало предметов для постройки
- Проект так и остался незаконченным (и это означает что игра так и осталась всего лишь идеей)

Моя оценка Spacebase DF-9 6/10. Хорошая игра... Была бы...

[b][i][url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/11769719/]Больше обзоров в нашей кураторской группе: Dreams of Genesis [/url]","Spacebase DF-9 is a pretty good project with great potential, which, unfortunately, was squandered by the developers.

This project was conceived as a kind of alternative to the famous Sid Meier's Civilization series, but unfortunately, things didn't quite go as planned.

So, we're faced with the task of founding a colony in space. Creating a base is fairly simple; in the first hour of the game, it's fairly easy (despite constant pirate attacks and meteor showers), but after the second hour, you start wondering, ""What next?"" And the answer is shockingly simple: ""NOTHING!""

Unfortunately, this game remains in Early Access, despite its great potential. After all, it would have been possible to develop one base, say, in a single ""solar"" system, while simultaneously establishing a second base with even greater potential (like Civilization, except the battle would be for a specific part of the galaxy, not just a single planet). Or, after successfully establishing yourself in space, you could colonize a nearby planet, and then it would be a real fight for survival. But, as I already said, my dreams were not destined to come true.

Overall, the game turned out very well, but as mentioned earlier, it's simply unfinished. A lot of glitches in the game are quite normal, at least for a beta test. The sound is quite decent. Regarding the graphics, I'd say that if you're looking for a game with good, and most importantly, high-quality visuals, you definitely shouldn't try this project. The graphics, for a standard strategy simulator, are pretty good; at least they don't turn the player off.

Finally, I'd like to list the pros and cons of this project.

Pros:
+ Very interesting concept
+ The game's graphics are quite good
+ Sound
+ Gameplay (though simple, is very convenient)
+ Addictive (but, unfortunately, not for long)

Cons:
- Bugs
- Few items to build
- The project remains unfinished (meaning the game remains just an idea)

My rating for Spacebase DF-9 is 6/10. A good game... If only...

Either the population is bashing each other's skulls in, civilians are running stupidly into combat zones and into the crossfire, or damn Armageddon breaks out in the form of debris blasts, massive invasions, and stupid, do-nothing security forces that just stand by and watch, and usually it all happens at once. I rarely get angry about games, but this game was once a great idea, but it's damn near unplayable!

Conclusion:
You want a game that makes you angry? Spacebase DF-9
You want anarchy? Spacebase DF-9
You want one or more worst-case scenarios? SPACEBASE DF fucking 9 >:("

There are still bugs, crashes to desktop, etc but you can workaround them if you know about them.

So in short- get this on sale if you are into games like gnomoria/towns. This game has been abandoned by the Devs (but at least they opensourced the code, unlike for example Isomer :/ ) but still improved by fans.","Got this in 1€ deal.

20260268,english,2016.00.03 20:08,❌,✅,0.7659041286,91,"Spacebase DF-9 lets you create your own space station, managing crew and resources all while staving off pirates and taking hails. It sounds like a lot of fun for anyone that was into Star Trek or even games like Dungeon Keeper 2, but it turns into all of the management and none of the fun. The big issues that I have with the game is that its tough to survive the first few moments of a normal game and beyond that, its just a dull game that forces you to assimilate all metal to keep growing your station to accommodate more crew.

Your objective is to keep your crew alive against first asphyxiation and later raiders. Even when your crew dies and the game tells you start a new game, it still continues. It is a game over without being concrete or giving you a final score before you have to start a new game.

To start with, there's an optional easy how to play tutorial level that will guide you through the basics without feeling forced upon you. The tutorial makes it easy to get up and running. Assign crew to the roster of jobs. Builders build when you construct rooms or objects. Miners will mine ore to be refined to get more matter to construct with. Technicians fix things and that's about as far as the tutorial gets.

You'll need a few things to get a space base operational. The first is power that comes in the form of reactors or a seed to start with. The second is the base itself which can be a giant room. You'll need an oxygen recycler since you are in space after all. After your space base has O2, an enclosed room and power, there's another matter and that's getting in. To do this you need to setup an air lock with two airlock doors one to the interior and the other to the exterior. This room also needs to have a locker for space suits.

Outside of the tutorial the giant problem that I have with the game is the level of difficulty when you're even getting started. The tutorial is nice and setup and it does let you continue on playing which is perhaps the best method. Consider that easy mode. You get to select your location and the game tells you how rich in ore and the frequency of attacks. Its a nice choice of difficulty without being a blunt difficulty slider.

In normal play, the game starts you with a seed for power and three crew in space suits with limited oxygen. There is so much that can go wrong. Running out of matter before your crew is in oxygen will doom you. So you need to budget building a small room to house the seed, a recycler, food dispenser, and a second for the air lock. Then you need to wait for the station to fill with oxygen and even for the air lock to cycle air in and out. Your spacemen can die in their suits when waiting for an air lock to pressurize. Oh but there is another nail to get caught on and that's the fact ore needs to be converted into matter, so it requires a matter refinery. This getting started kicks off the game and it will scare people away.

On paper, interesting things do happen. Derelict space stations will come into your area for you to explore and spaceships will dock with you. From there you have a choice, send your security over to investigate them or ignore them. The spaceships become part of your base where then you need to claim each room, which can be tedious and cumbersome since many small rooms are just tough to click on.

People can come aboard infected with a disease and then your science station will be put to work finding the cure. To do so, click whatever science room you've setup and select whatever they should research. There are a number of diseases to cure and upgrades to unlock. Upgrades include things like body armor and heavier doors.

You will get attacked from time to time. Raiders will float out in space and either try to shoot your miners as they pass by or they will board your station. Other times vessels will dock with your station and you'll be invaded. The catch is, unless you're watching a mining operation, its easy to spot and prepare for. You can have your security waiting for them, unless they're busy putting out a fire. It seems like more of an annoyance than a fun or cool challenge. You can also purchase wall mounted defense turrets.

Normal crew will still engage the enemy if they're in the same room, but to send crew in to fight hostiles, you'll need to assign crew to the security. From there you can make a security beacon that draws them to the area. It feels like an extra step and even marking the point and calling off security seems like it could be streamlined. A lot of the game needs to be streamlined.

Once attackers are incapacitated you can act to cuff, uncuff or execute them. In fact you can chose to execute or cuff any of your crew. Its just a little odd. Sometimes they will even chose to join your crew. Once resources become scarce, its just easier to execute them and dump them into the refiners to make matter.

Sometimes there is an issue where a firefight in an airlock can down the only crew inside the station. So anyone outside the station is forced to suffocate over time because the air lock refuses to open when someone is in there without a suit. It gets more hilarious because in smaller stations, crew will just stand in the air lock when its too crowded everywhere else. Spacebase DF-9 is an amazing game to watch because of its logic.

Speaking of logic, I managed to glitch the game into thinking there was no airlock. Those outside the station would die of asphyxiation and those inside the station would stay in there. Even crew joining would stay outside until they died. Destroying the airlock doors and rebuilding had no effect. Yet I could manually keep a door open so the spacemen could float into my base still in their suits. They would still suffer the same fate with no oxygen. The only way I was able to get people in and out was to build a new airlock.

In terms of crew management, when it comes to the roster everyone has an emotion to specific jobs no matter what their skill level is. You can have someone great at botany, yet hates doing it. Crew member you're the best doctor we have! Yeah but they get sad while doing it. Its a realistic and offers a level of micro management. Once you get to a point where you have crew of every class it gets easier since you no longer have people flip jobs such as having a miner one day and builder the next.

You get constant hails to answer and decide if you want them to join. It feels like a chore so I opt to avoid the calls. Sometimes the hails are to lull you into security so they can get ""in your base, killing your dudes."" Their transmissions all seems sketchy. There is no one that sounds like a clear cut good or bad choice. They all sound like they're trying to be funny and questionable, because that's what people like in their games, humor and charm. Well both fall flat and it feels forced.

Its also annoying having to press the faster speed setting, because the game will drop to normal speed whenever a yellow notice appears. It could be worse by being a popup box that you have to click like in so many other games. These warnings are things such as a crew member is starving or running out of oxygen. These warnings are color coated. Green means an overall hint on what's needed in your station such as more self space. Yellow and brown seem to be specific crew have achieved something or need something. Major warnings like crew being attacked or raiders about to board are in yellow so they blend in. A lot of times I realize we've been attacked after I see the number of crew go down. Raiders look similar to your own crew.

Spacebase DF-9 is just a tough game to love when it feels like a tough start followed by dull and uninspired management. It does feel like a fleshed out game with a lot of annoyances. I think scenarios would help extend my interest, but within a few hours I feel like I've seen everything there is to see. With all of that said, it is still worth the one dollar I paid for it.","Spacebase DF-9 lets you create your own space station, managing crew and resources all while staving off pirates and taking hails. It sounds like a lot of fun for anyone that was into Star Trek or even games like Dungeon Keeper 2, but it turns into all of the management and none of the fun. The big issues that I have with the game is that its tough to survive the first few moments of a normal game and beyond that, its just a dull game that forces you to assimilate all metal to keep growing your station to accommodate more crew.

Your objective is to keep your crew alive against first asphyxiation and later raiders. Even when your crew dies and the game tells you start a new game, it still continues. It is a game over without being concrete or giving you a final score before you have to start a new game.

To start with, there's an optional easy how to play tutorial level that will guide you through the basics without feeling forced upon you. The tutorial makes it easy to get up and running. Assign crew to the roster of jobs. Builders build when you construct rooms or objects. Miners will mine ore to be refined to get more matter to construct with. Technicians fix things and that's about as far as the tutorial gets.

You'll need a few things to get a space base operational. The first is power that comes in the form of reactors or a seed to start with. The second is the base itself which can be a giant room. You'll need an oxygen recycler since you are in space after all. After your space base has O2, an enclosed room and power, there's another matter and that's getting in. To do this you need to setup an air lock with two airlock doors one to the interior and the other to the exterior. This room also needs to have a locker for space suits.

Outside of the tutorial the giant problem that I have with the game is the level of difficulty when you're even getting started. The tutorial is nice and setup and it does let you continue on playing which is perhaps the best method. Consider that easy mode. You get to select your location and the game tells you how rich in ore and the frequency of attacks. Its a nice choice of difficulty without being a blunt difficulty slider.

In normal play, the game starts you with a seed for power and three crew in space suits with limited oxygen. There is so much that can go wrong. Running out of matter before your crew is in oxygen will doom you. So you need to budget building a small room to house the seed, a recycler, food dispenser, and a second for the air lock. Then you need to wait for the station to fill with oxygen and even for the air lock to cycle air in and out. Your spacemen can die in their suits when waiting for an air lock to pressurize. Oh but there is another nail to get caught on and that's the fact ore needs to be converted into matter, so it requires a matter refinery. This getting started kicks off the game and it will scare people away.

On paper, interesting things do happen. Derelict space stations will come into your area for you to explore and spaceships will dock with you. From there you have a choice, send your security over to investigate them or ignore them. The spaceships become part of your base where then you need to claim each room, which can be tedious and cumbersome since many small rooms are just tough to click on.

People can come aboard infected with a disease and then your science station will be put to work finding the cure. To do so, click whatever science room you've setup and select whatever they should research. There are a number of diseases to cure and upgrades to unlock. Upgrades include things like body armor and heavier doors.

You will get attacked from time to time. Raiders will float out in space and either try to shoot your miners as they pass by or they will board your station. Other times vessels will dock with your station and you'll be invaded. The catch is, unless you're watching a mining operation, its easy to spot and prepare for. You can have your security waiting for them, unless they're busy putting out a fire. It seems like more of an annoyance than a fun or cool challenge. You can also purchase wall mounted defense turrets.

Normal crew will still engage the enemy if they're in the same room, but to send crew in to fight hostiles, you'll need to assign crew to the security. From there you can make a security beacon that draws them to the area. It feels like an extra step and even marking the point and calling off security seems like it could be streamlined. A lot of the game needs to be streamlined.

Once attackers are incapacitated you can act to cuff, uncuff or execute them. In fact you can chose to execute or cuff any of your crew. Its just a little odd. Sometimes they will even chose to join your crew. Once resources become scarce, its just easier to execute them and dump them into the refiners to make matter.

Sometimes there is an issue where a firefight in an airlock can down the only crew inside the station. So anyone outside the station is forced to suffocate over time because the air lock refuses to open when someone is in there without a suit. It gets more hilarious because in smaller stations, crew will just stand in the air lock when its too crowded everywhere else. Spacebase DF-9 is an amazing game to watch because of its logic.

Speaking of logic, I managed to glitch the game into thinking there was no airlock. Those outside the station would die of asphyxiation and those inside the station would stay in there. Even crew joining would stay outside until they died. Destroying the airlock doors and rebuilding had no effect. Yet I could manually keep a door open so the spacemen could float into my base still in their suits. They would still suffer the same fate with no oxygen. The only way I was able to get people in and out was to build a new airlock.

In terms of crew management, when it comes to the roster everyone has an emotion to specific jobs no matter what their skill level is. You can have someone great at botany, yet hates doing it. Crew member you're the best doctor we have! Yeah but they get sad while doing it. Its a realistic and offers a level of micro management. Once you get to a point where you have crew of every class it gets easier since you no longer have people flip jobs such as having a miner one day and builder the next.

Unfortunately it may never be improved beyond that state. If you want to buy it for $1 (on sale) and hope that several years from now the player base mod team actually turns this into a working game, go for it.

But don't say you weren't warned. I bought this for a $1 knowing what I was getting into and I can't say I'm disappointed simply because I wanted to poke around and see what all the negative hype has been about. And the reality is, this game can not be recommended with a good conscience.

All the potential for a good game is here and than you realize your content ends shortly after figuring out how the controls work. There's no campaign, the tutorial is laughably poor at even explaining the basics and the sandbox play (which is pretty much all that exists) is laughably short before it becomes an endless loop.

You start with a random team of 3 with random skills in a random zone of space with random resources and (almost) random difficulty. You have some minor influence over how to skew the randomness (by choosing different zones of space); but in the end the only real choice you have is:
pick a dangerous area or pick a non dangerous area (or rather: pick an area where you cant play because you die instantly or pick an area where nothing happens until later and than goes into an endless loop of the same easily defeated enemies)

I don't know, I had some silly fun poking around with it for about an hour but there's just not much here and while I applaud the player base mod team for making an effort at improving the game I know full well that it could take years before there's enough fixes and content additions to make this game playable. 

I'll probably replay it for a few minutes every year or so just to see if they ever do anything with it.

EDIT 1: And I fell asleep listening to the music while playing, which is the only reason it looks like I have some hours of play time. Content was over in less than an hour. The rest of the listed play time was watching the spacebase like a fishbowl or sleeping with the music from the game playing.

EDIT 2 (years later):
Just to note it appears the mod team that wanted to fix this game no longer seem to be active, no real progress has been made or is currently available to the public.

On a brighter note the original Startopia is getting a spiritual successor in Spacebase Startopia.

Note: Spacebase Startopia is not made by either company that had anything to do with either Spacebase DF9 or Startopia, it's just borrowing the names from each, but the game play is clearly inspired by Startopia more so than Spacebase DF9. Anyway for those who may have been even curious about Spacebase DF9 I think either the original Startopia or its spiritual child Spacebase Startopia are both at least worth looking at:

Unfortunately it may never be improved beyond that state. If you want to buy it for $1 (on sale) and hope that several years from now the player base mod team actually turns this into a working game, go for it.

But don't say you weren't warned. I bought this for a $1 knowing what I was getting into and I can't say I'm disappointed simply because I wanted to poke around and see what all the negative hype has been about. And the reality is, this game can not be recommended with a good conscience.

All the potential for a good game is here and than you realize your content ends shortly after figuring out how the controls work. There's no campaign, the tutorial is laughably poor at even explaining the basics and the sandbox play (which is pretty much all that exists) is laughably short before it becomes an endless loop.

You start with a random team of 3 with random skills in a random zone of space with random resources and (almost) random difficulty. You have some minor influence over how to skew the randomness (by choosing different zones of space); but in the end the only real choice you have is:
pick a dangerous area or pick a non dangerous area (or rather: pick an area where you cant play because you die instantly or pick an area where nothing happens until later and than goes into an endless loop of the same easily defeated enemies)

I don't know, I had some silly fun poking around with it for about an hour but there's just not much here and while I applaud the player base mod team for making an effort at improving the game I know full well that it could take years before there's enough fixes and content additions to make this game playable. 

I'll probably replay it for a few minutes every year or so just to see if they ever do anything with it.

EDIT 1: And I fell asleep listening to the music while playing, which is the only reason it looks like I have some hours of play time. Content was over in less than an hour. The rest of the listed play time was watching the spacebase like a fishbowl or sleeping with the music from the game playing.

EDIT 2 (years later):
Just to note it appears the mod team that wanted to fix this game no longer seem to be active, no real progress has been made or is currently available to the public.

On a brighter note the original Startopia is getting a spiritual successor in Spacebase Startopia.

Note: Spacebase Startopia is not made by either company that had anything to do with either Spacebase DF9 or Startopia, it's just borrowing the names from each, but the game play is clearly inspired by Startopia more so than Spacebase DF9. Anyway for those who may have been even curious about Spacebase DF9 I think either the original Startopia or its spiritual child Spacebase Startopia are both at least worth looking at:

[b]Pros[/b]: The game is easy to pick up on: you start with a power source, minerals and a handful of colonists whose first priority is to build a modest space station with oxygen supplies, and expand to a small variety of room types while mining and refining minerals.

Travelers will often discard your rejection, and you quickly become over-populated. You barely have any control over crew morale.

1: no one ever does their jobs. the builders and the miners do their jobs, though when you tell the builders to take appart a derelict they go inside, take off their space suites, and drill a hole in the hull and kill themselves.

i got attacked by raiders and they got into my life support room and got killed, but then the room was full of dead bodies so no one wanted to go into the room to fix the oxygen recyclers. how do you get rid of dead bodies? well, the doctors are meant to come in and take them away, but whenever they enter the room they get upset by all the dead bodies and leave. THIS IS YOUR JOB! not to mention that they leave all these unconcious and injured people all over the base.

then there's the science team, there was a disease i needed them to reaserch so i assigned them to it and checked back on them about sixty minutes later and they had done NOTHING. i had a special room and everything, i double checked and they had just been standing in the hallway chatting the whole time. eventually they got to work, but people were sick and going to DIE!

the security job is nearly pointless, and what they actually do can hardly be considered security. people assigned to security patrol a small area around a single security beacon, and the only real use for this is to have them explor derelicts. i just ended up building defense turrets everywhere, but they have limited view.
 
1.5: you can't tell anyone what to do, so even though this room is on fire no one knows and your fusion reactors are going to burn down.

2: given how little you're actually able to do as a player, the game asks way too much of you. every five minutes it's telling you there's a new disease that needs to be researched, when instead you want to research new technology (because apparently the scientists who research dark matter also research medicine, and not the doctors), raiders seem to attack more and more frequently untill you're perpetually under attack, and the game is always telling you that, even though you have 30 reactors and twice as many oxygen recyclers than you need for your population, you don't have enough power or oxygen.

3: the AI is stupid. outside of not doing their jobs, when i got attacked by raiders the AI does nothing to avoid them. when they walk into a room and see a raider, most of them just stop and hold up their hands in fear before being shot. raiders aren't even that smart, one broke into my pub and started punching my fridge.

4: i'm not listing all the problems, i'm glad this game was so cheap when i baught it, because it's too late to get a refund.","this game has a few too many problems for me.

The most annoying thing about the game by far is how your station residents are incredibly sluggish when it comes to doing anything.

19370425,russian,2015.10.29 22:23,❌,✅,0.5,0,"Начинается всё довольно оптимистично: невысокие системные требования, приятная графическая часть и музыка.
Строимся, добываем единственный ресурс, строимся ещё, ведём исследования... 

Искусственный идиот восхитителен: подопечные неимоверно тупят, занимаются чем угодно, кроме своих обязанностей, устраивают драки, ломают оборудование, набиваются вдесятером в крошечную комнату, вынюхивая оттуда весь кислород, открывают настежь обе двери шлюзокамер... Даже симсы умнее: им хотя бы можно раздавать приказы напрямую. 
Регулярно набИгающие рейдеры тоже отличаются умом и сообразительностью: единственное, что ими движет - ""Халк ломать!"", как бы фатально для них оно ни заканчивалось. При этом они ухитряются в одиночку уничтожать весь персонал станции, выходя победителями из столкновения с десятком прокачанных охранников - ага, броня и оружие для них исследованы, а смысл... Видимо, читерные стволы пиратам кто-то добрый подвёз, чтобы скомпенсировать недостаток мозгов.

Невысокие системные требования тоже оказались скомпенсированы: неважнецкая оптимизация. Время от времени игра, сожрав остатки оперативной памяти, начинает нещадно тормозить. 

Выводы:
- Покупать стоит разве что на распродаже и с хорошей скидкой(как я, к счастью, и сделал).
- Игра может понравиться любителям издеваться над NPC: за 17 часов игры я обнаружил, что способов умереть они знают десятки, и не устают изобретать новые.
- Жаростойкая плита на кресло обязательна.","It all starts off quite optimistically: low system requirements, pleasant graphics and music.
We build, extract the only resource, build some more, conduct research...

The artificial idiot is delightful: the players are incredibly stupid, doing anything but their duties, starting fights, destroying equipment, cramming ten of them into a tiny room, sniffing out all the oxygen, throwing open both airlock doors... Even Sims are smarter: at least you can give them direct orders.

The regularly arriving raiders are also distinguished by their intelligence and resourcefulness: the only thing that drives them is ""Hulk, smash!"", no matter how fatal it ends for them. At the same time, they manage to single-handedly wipe out the entire station's personnel, emerging victorious from clashes with a dozen highly-powered guards—yeah, their armor and weapons have been researched, but the point... Apparently, someone kindly provided the pirates with cheat guns to compensate for their lack of brains.

The low system requirements were also compensated for by poor optimization. From time to time, the game, having consumed the remaining RAM, begins to mercilessly slow down.

Conclusions:
- It's worth buying only on sale and with a good discount (which, fortunately, I did).
- The game might appeal to those who like tormenting NPCs: after 17 hours of play, I discovered that they know dozens of ways to die, and they never tire of inventing new ones.
- A heat-resistant plate for the chair is a must."

Leider unfertig mit haufenweise spielzerstörenden Bugs. 
Hier eine kleine Auswahl:
- Wird ein Charakter an der Luftschleuse verwundet, schließt diese nicht mehr. Und er kann auch nicht von Ärzten behandelt werden. Lösung: Exekutieren!:(
- Untersucht man ein Wrack mit Gegenern legen die eigenen Soldaten die Raumanzüge ab und durchsuchen das Schiff. Leider herrscht dort Sauerstoffmangel, weshalb sie in Panik geraten und ihre Anzüge nicht mehr anziehen. Plopp, ganze Truppe hops. Besonders ärgerlich, weil das Skillen von Sicherheitsleuten aufwändig ist.  
- Reparatur Prioritäten werden wohl nur ausschließlich nach Zustand und nicht nach Distanz bestimmt. Wenns schlecht läuft, laufen die Techniker nur noch und reparieren nicht.
- Es verhungern Leute neben Nahrungsverteilern, die alle anderen versorgen.

In der aktuellen Form (Ende Nov 2015) nur mit großem Frust spielbar.
","A really nice concept.
Unfortunately unfinished with tons of game-breaking bugs.
Here's a small selection:
- If a character is wounded at the airlock, it won't close. And they can't be treated by doctors either. Solution: Execute! :(
- If you investigate a wreck with enemies, your own soldiers take off their spacesuits and search the ship. Unfortunately, there's a lack of oxygen there, which is why they panic and don't put their suits back on. Plop, the whole squad goes down. This is particularly annoying because leveling up security guards is time-consuming.
- Repair priorities seem to be determined solely by condition and not by distance. If things go badly, the technicians just walk and don't repair.
- People starve to death next to food distributors that supply everyone else.

In its current form (end of November 2015), it's only playable with great frustration.

As far as abandon titles go, this one seems like it is close to being complete. However, two big elements are missing. 

First, there is gameplay balance. The game starts off feeling like you can do anything in it, if you just put the time and effort into it. And for the first 20 or 30 minutes this feels true.  You expand your base, explore ships, and manage your people to get the most out of them.  But then the raiders, and meteor strikes happen. And this is where the missing gameplay balance is most obvious.  Negative events are important to any game, if things were always good, than there wouldn't be any challenge. But the speed, and frequency of the negative events needs to be balance out against what the play can and cannot do, so that they can overcome them, and not just suffer.

So even if you go to the security tab and tell your security team to defend a breach point a lot of the time they will stand idle and just be cut down one after another and the SPACE PIRATES will go on their merry way butchering your whole crew.
How to prevent this? Set EVERYBODY to security since that is the only way people defend themselves properly, afterwards you can try to figure out who does what job. CHAOS, Chaos everywhere, send in space marines to purge all this chaos.

After learning that my security were completely incompetent I instead put turrets, over there, outside, in that room there.. EVERYWHERE! Turrets are far more effective than actual people, you don't need to worry about losing something that took ages to level up and they kill raiders near instantly. <3 Turrets.

Base is defended - rockin'! Crap, tons of dead bodies in the base, mostly raiders but also my own people sometimes too, but they are making the crew depressed.

I stare at my doctors and notice two standing in the infirmary playing videogames (curse you videogames!) and another one in the pub getting drunk and brawling. I sigh and decide that if they want to look at them so bad then sure, they can keep their cadaver friends.

Despite my doctors being either drunken masters or videogame addicts, I don't have any huge illnesses or parasitic worms devouring the crew lately. Still no work is getting done, so I change all the bartenders to other stuff hoping this abolition will get people to work.

I have miners and builders getting picked off by raiders and kill bots because the AI does not avoid danger and there is no way I saw to tell them to stop and go home. I stop caring if my crew die, it is worse than herding sheep because at least sheep run away from danger, crew numbers drop, bodies piling up, nobody cares and just drinks away their sorrows on Spacebase. 
I decide to quit playing the game before the chaos and stupid mechanics get to me and I become as apathetic as the crew, right before I quit - I notice that a doctor is finally removing all the dead bodies on the ship.

Por lo que he leído los devs dejaron el juego a medias y lo sacaron a la venta, pero después un grupo de programadores lo han arreglado.

Steam me regaló el juego tras la compra de otro y, tras la abrumadora cantidad de votos negativos, pensaba que sería un auténtico truño. Nada más lejos de la realidad, el juego está bastante decente con lo que pretende ofrecer, creación y gestión de una base espacial: obtención de recursos, captación de nuevos inquilinos, combate ante repentinos ataques, reparación de maquinaria dañada, investigación, botánica, comida, oxígeno, minería, torretas de defensa, etc...  Nada más comenzar, puedes ubicar tu base en diferentes puntos de la galaxia, cada lugar con unas condiciones determinadas: mayor o menor número de asteroides para la obtención de minerales, mayor o menor paso de naves amigas o enemigas, etc. Recomiendo hacer el tutorial porque si empezáis de 0 se hace un poco lioso, sobre todo sin estar el juego traducido al castellano, aún así no se requiere un nivel alto de inglés.

En resumen, una especia de Sims espacial con unos gráficos simples pero coloristas. La única pega es que está en inglés, por lo demás cumple con lo que se supone que tiene que ofrecer.","Despite the large number of negative reviews and its low rating, after playing it for a couple of hours, I have no choice but to give it a positive vote.

From what I've read, the devs left the game half-finished and released it for sale, but a group of programmers later fixed it.

Steam gave me the game after purchasing another game, and after the overwhelming number of negative votes, I thought it would be a real piece of crap. Nothing could be further from the truth; the game is quite decent for what it aims to offer: creation and management of a space base: obtaining resources, recruiting new tenants, combating sudden attacks, repairing damaged machinery, research, botany, food, oxygen, mining, defense turrets, etc. From the start, you can place your base in different parts of the galaxy, each location with specific conditions: a greater or lesser number of asteroids for obtaining minerals, greater or lesser passage of friendly or enemy ships, etc. I recommend completing the tutorial because starting from scratch can be a bit confusing, especially since the game isn't translated into Spanish. Even so, a high level of English isn't required.

In short, a kind of space Sims with simple yet colorful graphics. The only drawback is that it's in English; otherwise, it does what it's supposed to offer."

If you don't like games like the Sims or SimCity you may want to pass this by but if you do enjoy games like that then this is a must have. The neat thing is that all of this happens in a sci-fi setting and the game can be addictive as you want to do the best you can for your crew and protect them from raiders. Make sure you get the The Officially Unofficial v1.08 Patch! Now with Brainworms! to make the game even more enjoyable. Trust me."

Unfortunately, the game is now ABANDONWARE. I do not recommend purchasing this game unless you can accept the game in an unfinished 40% state the game is in. It is fun, but there is little content, the AI is crap, and will wear out on it fast due to odd bugs and little content.

The game constantly throws stuff at you, and sometimes there isn't actually a good answer.  Let me explain.  You are building a big section of your base.  Things are going well.  You then see a message appear on the side of the screen saying how one of your builder's space suit oxygen is running low.  Sometimes they quickly make their own way back to the airlock, stopping them from dieing.  Sometimes they just carry on working and then die.  You can try to avoid this by sending them to the infirmary (which is obviously inside) manually.  But sometimes they don't bother to listen and still die.

  Another example of this game throwing rubbish into your face would be those raiders who have high tech weaponry.  It takes one of them to take out tonnes of vital parts to your station as well as many many people with inferior weaponry, and thats it.  Your space base is broken and/or on fire and half your population dead.  Yay.

The random space debris causing major fires and ruptures within your base can easily kill a room full of sleeping people, again almost half your bases population. 

But the main thing that gets me is that for a game that is meant to be a mix between economy and fighting, all the fighting is unfair (see the first paragraph) and the economy lacks whats really needed.  The AI don't know when to prioritise fixing vital oxygen recyclers over fixing an unused door.  They also don't know when it is useful to take a break - many will take a break and not perform tasks during critical points in gameplay, causing negative effects (most prominently the players mood).  

In conclusion this game has a lot of potential.  A lot.  But it doesn't have basic concepts like manual prioritization and decent AI.  The whole game needs a huge amount of balancing, and until this happens I recommend you simply follow this game, rather than get it.  If and when the devs make the changes necessary this game will definately worth the money.  But for now, I recommend you spend it elsewhere.

Da ich selbst hauptberufich Softwareentwickler bin, muss ich leider sagen, dass das eine Schande für unseren gesamten Berufsstand ist.
Ich halte early access eigentlich für ein Versprechen - ein Versprechen, für die Unterstützung der Anwender ein sich kontinuierlich besser werdendes Produkt zu liefern, dass auch den Kundenwünschen entspricht.

Man stelle sich vor, die Autohersteller würden Euch ein 300-PS-Auto versprechen, das nur 1l pro 1.000 km verbrauchen würde, wenn man nur jetzt bestellt. Dann kauft man das Ding und bekommt ein AUto was mehr verbraucht, als die handelsüblichen Autos und noch dazu dauernd ausgeht oder nur noch links abbiegen kann. Dann würden wir ganz klar von Betrug sprechen.

Wie gesagt: Ich bin selber hauptberuflicher Softwareentwickler und kenne die Interna der Entwicklung von Software - bevor jetzt wieder jemand mit dem Argument kommt ""die armen Softwareentwickler"" ...

Ich halte das für eine bodenlose Frechheit.","Unfortunately, this is typical for many Early Access games. They take money and then stop development.
As a full-time software developer myself, I have to say that this is a disgrace for our entire profession.
I actually consider Early Access a promise – a promise to support users and deliver a continuously improving product that also meets customer expectations.

Imagine if car manufacturers promised you a 300-hp car that would consume only 1 liter per 1,000 km if you just ordered it now. Then you buy the thing and get a car that consumes more fuel than standard cars, and on top of that, it constantly stalls or can only turn left. Then we would clearly be talking about fraud.

As I said: I am a full-time software developer myself and know the ins and outs of software development – ​​before someone comes up with the argument ""those poor software developers"" again...

The game itself offers good game play and a decent UI, the tutorial is standard, does the job. The only thing that annoys me about this game is that although the features the game has are damn cool and entertaining (at least for 37 hourish ahaa) it had the potentially to become one of the best but sadly double-fine as per usual started as being active with the alpha community but did the inevitable thing they almost always seem to do and screwed everyone by being half arsed and essentially slapping a for sale sign on an alpha despite many things 'in the pipeline' so they claimed (including workshop compatibility which would have only made this game even more fun to play, more features, more control, more events and ultimately a better game). So i will still recommended this game, but however please ONLY BUY THIS ON SALE!!!!!!!!!!

На самом деле игра не такая уж плохая сама по себе. Я читал некоторые рецензии, и по ощущениям с момента этих рецензий игру подлечили. Я не видел никаких суровых багов и вылетов, да и жители моей богом забытой станции не тупили по поводу своих основных обязанностей. Прокрастинировали немного, но это скорее симуляция реальности :) Итак, ответ на главный вопрос - стоит ли брать игру: да, если она достается вам бесплатно в бандле с другими играми Double Fine (как мне), либо с офигеть какой скидкой на распродаже. Первые часов пять играть в нее довольно интересно. Сколько вы готовы отдать за пять часов игры?

Удивительное.
Я всегда мечтал когда-нибудь найти в себе силы и как следует заняться игрой Dwarf Fortress. Этакий вызов моим способностям, воображению и терпению. Данная игра - прекрасный первый шаг в этом направлении. По сути, игровой процесс как концепция совпадает полностью. Но в данном случае он проще, беднее и не настолько суров. вы освоите основные принципы того, что надо делать и чего делать не надо в играх такого типа. Тренируйтесь.

Плюсы:
- старая добрая игра в конструктор, строим космическую базу своей мечты.

Минусы:
- мало всего - контента, событий, вариаций, стартовых условий (даже плюсов и минусов в этой рецензии), это в свою очередь порождает быструю скуку.

В общем, как было сказано выше, эта игра не столько ценна сама по себе, сколько как детский тренажер перед игрой в подобные ей. Купить, немного потыкаться и все. А значит рекомендовать ее я не могу.","4/10

The game itself isn't that bad. I read some reviews, and it feels like they've improved the game since those reviews. I didn't see any serious bugs or crashes, and the inhabitants of my godforsaken station weren't oblivious to their primary responsibilities. They did procrastinate a bit, but that's more of a simulation of reality. :) So, the answer to the main question—is it worth getting the game? Yes, if you get it for free in a bundle with other Double Fine games (like me), or at a crazy discount during a sale. The first five hours of playing it are quite interesting. How much are you willing to pay for five hours of play?

Amazing.
I've always dreamed of finding the strength to properly tackle Dwarf Fortress. It's a challenge to my abilities, imagination, and patience. This game is a great first step in that direction. Essentially, the gameplay and concept are completely consistent. But in this case, it's simpler, leaner, and less rigorous. You'll master the basic principles of what to do and what not to do in games of this type. Practice.

Pros:
- A good old-fashioned construction game, building the space base of your dreams.

Cons:
- There's not enough content, events, variations, or starting conditions (even the pros and cons in this review), which in turn leads to quick boredom.

Overall, as mentioned above, this game isn't so much valuable in itself as it is a pre-game trainer for children. Buy it, play around a bit, and that's it. Therefore, I can't recommend it."

It was basically Dwarf Fortress in space with graphics from the list of planned features, and looked to be quite promising.  Even with what was in the game, it was at least worth playing for a couple dozen hours, even if it lacked any real depth to keep you playing for too long.  

Then, it was cancelled while still in pre-alpha...

The developer abandoned it because, as far as I can tell, they just plain didn't think it was selling well enough to be worth putting money into finishing the game.  It's kind of crushing that a company that had a positive reputation like DoubleFine would just abandon a half-made game like this.  (And for the record, my first real notification of this was that my previous positive early-access review managed to get a near-constant stream of downvotes for the simple fact that it had been a positive review...)  The ""consolation prize"" was that they handed out free Hack 'n' Slash games to purchasers of this game (limited time, already over), although it raises the question of why players would trust in the next early access game when the last one was abandoned...

That said, I don't have the same bitterness a lot of people seemed to have. (Likely because I don't live in hype of upcoming games when I'm sitting on a mountain of Steam games I've got in reserve.)  

As for the game, itself, it's fairly simple.  Start with nothing but a few resources, build an airlock and air recycler quick to not suffocate when your suits run out of air, build a mining station, and start mining for more resources.  From there, use resources to start making more rooms, and stuffing them full of all the random things in the menu until you have a little of everything.  Then have random visitors stay at your station, and start building MORE of everything.  Then have asteroids slam into your station (just lock everyone out of the threatened rooms), or have some raiders (set everyone to security, and bum rush them all), or have other mystery stations drift nearby (remove their walls from the outside to suck all the likely hostile inhabitants into the vacuum of space instead of letting your guys get killed). By and large, the game just lather, rinses, and repeats from there.  

If you really like managers, I can say you might have fun with it for a few hours, but don't get it unless it's absolutely dirt cheap, because you're probably going to experience everything this game really has to offer in about 6 hours or so, and from there, it's just a matter of building a base larger and larger to cram more and more population in.","Originally, I had a positive review of this game.

16661650,english,2015.05.24 02:35,✅,✅,0.5562564731,12,"Spacebase DF9’s 2,859 “mostly negative” reviews (at the time of writing) are probably more a testament to Steam’s ubiquity as a content delivery tool than to the game’s own (very real) problems. And it does have problems, to be sure, but depending on your outlook and how much you pay for it, they’re not insurmountable.

Its gameplay appears at first to be something along the lines of the legendary Dwarf Fortress, Mucky Foot’s 2001 classic Startopia, or Firefly Studios’  2003 Space Colony, but its flaws – the result of a suddenly-abandoned development process – make it play more like a Roguelike. Your rather nebulous goal is to re-populate the galaxy by building endless space stations, staffing them with an ever-increasing supply of wandering space travellers and keeping them happy and safe from weird diseases, bloodthirsty raiders and each other. Material for building comes from mining asteroids or disassembling passing wrecks and derelicts, and your rooms and corridors are built and then assigned different uses – residential, life support, various social, scientific and utilitarian functions. There’s a strong people-management aspect too, as each new arrival at your base can be assigned to one of eight different duties, each of which will make them feel varying degrees of satisfaction or frustration, and each of which they’ll be good or bad at according to a 1-5 star system. In all respects, the UI is super friendly and makes juggling your people as easy as possible. Which is great, because you can eventually build gigantic structures with literally dozens and dozens and dozens of crewmembers. Crucially though, you have almost zero direct control over your people. You can only order them to report to the infirmary if they’re injured, and even then it may take them a while to limp their way over.

At first, as you learn the ropes, each new game comes hard and fast. Death comes as a result of being ill-prepared to research a disease cure, or not having sufficient defences against a surprise Raider attack, or for any one of dozens of interestingly unfortunate and unforeseeable reasons (usually often as funny as they are frustrating). But the actual process of making your space stations is so much fun that the urge to immediately try again keeps you clicking, again and again, learning more and more each time, developing and abandoning new ideas and strategies as you go. Spacebase DF 9 is very much one of those Civ/Morrowind-type games that suck the hours out of your life without you realising. Be prepared for some really late nights if you decide to have ‘just one quick go’ before bedtime.

Adding to this feeling is the game’s own save system, which by default consists of toggle-able silent autosaves and a Save and Quit menu option. Like a psychopathic lover, Spacebase DF9 doesn’t want you to be anywhere other than inside it, grinding at full speed. Played like this, the feeling is very much of a  Roguelike’s ‘one life, one death’ trip, and all of this helps mitigate the pain of being screwed by one of the game’s terrible bugs or imbalances.

Yes, they are quite terrible, unfortunately. But in the twenty hours that I’ve played it so far, the problems have been all about imbalance and lack of tweaking, rather than outright bugs. One of the worst of these is the fact that the guns on enemy ships, once they’ve boarded you, remain ‘hostile’ even after you’ve killed or captured the invaders (sometimes they can even be reformed and will join your crew to start a new life), or claimed their ship as your own. Only by eventually disassembling enough of the enemy ship will you be able to cut off power to the gun, thus making it safe. But getting to the bloody thing can be a real game-breaker – these defensive turrets have great range and cut through people in spacesuits like a lightsabre through yogurt. It’s at times like these that the lack of direct control over your spacemen becomes a real tooth-grinder, and you can end up with piles and piles of floating corpses made up of the Builders who foolishly crossed in front of the guns to get behind them (in space, the AI paths in direct lines from point-to-point), as well as the Doctors who went to retrieve their corpses. 

As far as imbalance in the invisible numbers, the worst offender is the near-constant brawling that goes on. At best this leads to a trip to the brig to cool off for the aggressor and a trip to the infirmary for the victim. At worst, guns will be drawn, and people and facilities start falling. In-fighting is a result of a brilliant system of cabin fever that is determined by various things, including job satisfaction and a host of actual personal feelings and emotions, all of which can be monitored on the crew’s individual profiles. Assigning two people who hate each other to a double cabin is a recipe for disaster, while the sight of bloody corpses littering the place has an obvious impact on depression (especially if the deceased was someone’s friend). But again, due to the abruptly aborted development process, it’s one of several crucial, glaringly imbalanced systems. Which, unless Double Fine release the source code, as they’ve promised to but still not yet done, may never be properly sorted out. This is doubly frustrating because a lua-based modding system is present and correct, but so far nobody’s done anything with it.

Like the similarly blighted and similarly great fun Aliens: Colonial Marines, it’s a game with a bad reputation that in reality is only partially deserved. Early adopters and those who saw the potential for a Dwarf Fortress in space have every right to be annoyed (and to make those thousands of “negative” Steam reviews). But for those of us coming to the game in its ‘finished’ state, and aware of the lingering problems, there is still much fun to be had. Double Fine’s original plan for the game was hugely ambitious, ultimately requiring much more funding than they could successfully raise for it (hence the truncated development). It was only unfortunate that they had already taken it well into the Early Access phase at USD 20 a pop before they realised this. But that’s one of the risks of public alphas, crowdfunding and transparent game development. Like condoms, no one's happy when they go wrong. 

If we’re looking at it in financial terms, then in my case I bought it in the 2015 Steam summer sale at -50%, or EUR 4.99, and have played it now for nearly 21 hours. My feeling is that I’ve had at least 20 Euros of fun from it, and that’s quite important. With some AAA titles costing nearly 60 Euro-dollarpounds and offering dozens of hours of gameplay, but failing to deliver even half as much fun, for a flawed gem like Spacebase DF9 to give you that elusive feeling of true, full-belly satisfaction is, I think, quite a feat.","Spacebase DF9’s 2,859 “mostly negative” reviews (at the time of writing) are probably more a testament to Steam’s ubiquity as a content delivery tool than to the game’s own (very real) problems.

Its unfinshed other than that.

It plays well, great concept and idea of running your own space station from scratch and watching it crumble cause you let one person in or broke the wrong wall or no fire extingushers. You pick a spot in the galaxy hoping to find a perfect place for mining and saftey.
Its fun but its unfinshed.

I played less then 30 minutes, i didn't even get passedthe totorial. Not because it was hardbut becuase it wasn't good. It was a window in the bottom left corner telling me what to do. and everything was unloacked in the totorial from the start.

This game also has very little in the way of content. By this I mean there's not much to it. For example i only saw one generator and no alternitives. And everything's really basic too. Life support's just a structure that you put into the life support room.
Also the NPCs aren't great, they randomly do stuff like exercise in the hallways... and doorways. No really, i have someone doing push-ups in the doorway to the generator room. That bring me to another NPC related point: they're annimations. usually when I play games this is never a big problem but with Spacebase I suddenly had many problems. The annimations don't seem one bit natual, or smooth.
Now I know alot of people found this had more bugs than a garden, but the only noticable one i found was when NPCs left the station via the airlock they only went though one door. That door was to get into the airlock, everytime someone left i just had to sit there in horror because the floor kept eating them.

We see your Spacebase is complete, erm, wait, are those citizens being sucked into space? We heard that you guys had big plans to get this thing up and running but it seems that you have a lumpy, kind of lopsided base... Oh well, it had promise but appears to have been partially abandoned with only a token staff left behind to keep the raiders and pirates away. Hopefully there will be a crew out there willing to get in back into order before it enters the atmosphere of some celestial body out there.

I know Double Fine has to find a way to pay the bills, so cutting the project to work on something more lucrative is the smart thing to do for them. Leaving it on the store and calling it 'finished' to try and squeeze it for cash is simply ridiculous though.

We'll leave the game on Early Access and when we've made enough money on additional early supporters we'll continue development."" and I wouldn't have batted an eyelash.

Геймплей в ней с развитием не меняется. В игре нету нету ничего что сделало бы ее затягивающей. В ней нету ни сложных производственных цепочек. Ни развитого боевого аспекта. Ни солидного дерева технологий.  Все что в ней есть это базовая механика, да она работает, может быть иногда нестабильно но работает. Но делать в ней просто нечего.  Dwarf Fortress или даже Гномории эта игра и в подметки не годится. В ней низкий потолок развития, как только ты наладиш производство еды, создаш бар, медотсек, и тренажерку делать особо больше нечего будет. Да есть рейдеры, но они давольно скучные, тут нету особо какой то сложной тактики или стратегии против них.

The gameplay doesn't change as you progress. There's nothing engaging about it. There are no complex production chains. No developed combat. No solid tech tree. All it has are basic mechanics, and they work, maybe a bit unstable at times, but they work. But there's simply nothing to do. This game doesn't hold a candle to Dwarf Fortress or even Gnomoria. It has a low development ceiling; once you've established food production, built a bar, a med bay, and a gym, there's not much else to do. Yes, there are raiders, but they're pretty boring, and there's no particularly complex tactics or strategy against them. Yes, with constant population growth due to migration, you'll need to constantly build new living quarters and expand food production, but this is essentially a dull repetition of the previous actions.

Therefore I am not reviewing this game as a complete product, but rather I am reviewing its creative process. As a building management and construction simulator, Spacebase DF-9 fails the most important criterion in any simulation, uniqueness. Uniqueness is a core aspect in simulation games because it is there in which specialties and creativity come together to make an enjoyable and memorable simulation game. Examples of popular simulation games are Goat Simulator, The Sims, and Train Simulator, which all can be easily identified by each of their unique points. That being said, it is hard to find unique points in Spacebase DF-9. As I am writing this review, in trying to remember things that were unique I find myself fixated more on the bugs than actual gameplay. 

Overlooking the bugs, let me break down the gameplay. You build a base, gather resources, and make the base bigger and repeat. You have raiders that attack your base but they don’t present a threat if you properly maintain security. You have asteroid showers that happen every once in a while that start fires and destroy structures such as walls and they need to be patched up. You will get transmissions every once in a while so that people can move in, attack, or attach themselves to the base. The difficulty ramps up as your base becomes larger and more populated; you have to keep track of people’s morale, energy consumption, and security.  That is about it. 

As I have stated earlier, it lacks uniqueness. The simulation itself is very basic and there seems to be a large amount of creative work in creating the characters. Unfortunately, the programmers made the characters expandable, having them die very easily and having a lot of them makes the characters feel insignificant and therefore, their uniqueness insignificant. As a simulation, this game will not stand out in sales or reviews unless the creative department decides to do some major reworking. Furthermore if unchanged and published, this game will stand out as one of many examples of morale hazard in pre-release gaming. 

 [u] Note:[/u] As I was about to post this I realized that this game was published a year ago. I could not fathom that a game this unpolished and lacking in content could be deemed complete by anyone who took pride in their work. In the end, it seems that DoubleFine just took everyone’s money and fled.

3.) it's bugged. not in a ""it crashes"" way, but in a ""it constantly kills your space station with peculiar mechanics details"" way.

In the tutorial mission, I ordered the removal of a wall. Funny enough, the floor got removed as well (the difference between the 2 available remove/disintegrate commands was not explained"", so I had a hull breach in the corridor.  To fix that, one of my builders would have needed to use an airlock - which was on the other side of the corridor. Result: dead end, start a new station.
On the new station, I build the most important new structures (generator room, oxygen source, airlock).

Or maybe the airlock did get finished, but failed to operate because all 3 tried to use it at the same time... I don't know, I will not try to find out. And I will not start a new game.

I can say, that the concept for this game was great! A spacebase that half the time acts nicely, and runs like clockwork, then raiders show up and wreck s**t up. I was really excited when I heard this, and boughtit in early access. When I bought the game, I thought it was doing quite well for an early access game, and I enjoyed it!

But, there were some signs that the game development was having problems. Updates, weeks and sometimes months apart. And these updates were adding barely anything to the game, and even bug fixing was quite slow. The AI, was and still is unbearable. And will do stupid things. The variety of things you can build in specific rooms is extremly limited.

And, of course, this game was pushed out the door, being realeased way to early. An example, was that your station's power supply. That was not even a factor until the update before realease.

My last words on this are, Don't buy this piece of shit, in fact, don't buy any sort of thing from Double Fine, unless you can at least make sure that production will finish on the game fully

2/10- Fun for an hour or two, but no storyline, not enought content, and lack of any new things happening after half an hour of gameplay, makes this game awful.

Long story short- STAY AWAY!!!","(I wanted to redo my review for a better viewpoint and whatnot. This review also comes from someone who played early access, and played post realease)

I can say, that the concept for this game was great! A spacebase that half the time acts nicely, and runs like clockwork, then raiders show up and wreck s**t up. I was really excited when I heard this, and boughtit in early access. When I bought the game, I thought it was doing quite well for an early access game, and I enjoyed it!

But, there were some signs that the game development was having problems. Updates, weeks and sometimes months apart. And these updates were adding barely anything to the game, and even bug fixing was quite slow. The AI, was and still is unbearable. And will do stupid things. The variety of things you can build in specific rooms is extremly limited.

And, of course, this game was pushed out the door, being realeased way to early. An example, was that your station's power supply. That was not even a factor until the update before realease.

Начинается с того. Что космонавты не могут влететь в камеру, для перехода на станцию. Они просто висят и медленно помирают. Ладно. Как-то их затащили на базу. Начинаем развивать. Строимся. И тут начинают просто толпами рейдеры прилетать. И убивать мне всё и всех. Даже если научиться от них защищаться. Например, турелей наставить везде. Начинается другая напасть. Инженеры, которые должны поддерживать базу. Просто тупо ничего не делают. В результате все начинает разваливаться. Электричество пропадает. И база умирает, что её уже не спасти. Ладно, кое-как выживаем и добираем жильцов более 45. И тут на тебе. Постоянные фризы и в конечном итоге. Игра начинает каждые 5 минут вылетать.

The game's concept is excellent. And the start seems good. But there's glitch after glitch.
It starts with the astronauts being unable to fly into the chamber to enter the station. They're just hanging there, slowly dying. Okay. Somehow they've gotten to the base. We start developing. Building. And then raiders start arriving in droves. And they're killing everything and everyone. Even if I learn to defend myself against them, like setting up turrets everywhere. Then another plague begins. The engineers, who are supposed to maintain the base, simply do nothing. As a result, everything starts falling apart. The power goes out. And the base dies, and it's beyond saving. Okay, we somehow survive and get more than 45 inhabitants. And then, bam! Constant freezes and, ultimately, the game starts crashing every 5 minutes.

This was when the developers were updating the game.

Since that time, there have been very few, limiting updates. To my mind, there is no real point to the game. The whole thing about choosing where to have your base is very cool, but in reality there is little to no difference. There are lots of rooms you can put down, which is great, but I can find nothing to do apart from put all the rooms down and defend myself against the waves of baddies.
Which leads us onto another problem: Combat
If I was to be nice, I would say that the combat was... flawed. The truth of the matter is that even when you assign people to security, and give them a place the have to defend, if they are talking or playing a game or eating etc, they will simply ignore you while the baddies are quite happily blowing the c*** out of your base.

There are many bugs with game, including the priorities problem as outlined above. This was ok when the game was in development, but now that the developers seems to have abandoned it, there are too many for it to be considered a full game. 

That basically sums up my review. It had promise, but there is not enough actual game or polish for it to be considered a complete game. Save some money, go and buy Prison Architect or donate to/download Dwarf Fortress.","I really wanted to like this game. I saw it featured very early on and picked it up.

This game was made to be modded, which in this case means the dev handed over game development to the players instead of finishing it. I would be happy with some awesome mods that finish the game out, but there is no workshop support.

After four or five failed bases I thought I had got the hang of it. I had beaten every disease and easily defended against 20-30 attacks. Then a wave of attacks hit (they often come in threes within seconds of each other) and I took out the first two no sweat with my five man security team with a combined star rating of ~14 out of 25 (which is quite good). Then the last raider boarded all by himself, and killed my entire crew.

I was boarded by the main antagonist of a space pirate anime apparently.

I would have researched better weapons and armor, but my two man scientific team were busy trying to develop anti-viral air scrubbers to counter the relentless spread of disease.

My entire population was 18. 5 Security, 2 Scientists, 1 Bartender, 2 Doctors, 1 Botanist, 4 Miners and 3 Builders. They were all busy non stop.

14894858,english,2015.02.15 07:09,✅,✅,0.500630796,5,"Going against most of the people here, it seems, I think DF-9 should get a generally positive review.

So you know where my view comes from: I bought this game early in alpha because I had a DF coupon, but I rarely play early EA games.  Aside from a quick try in alpha, I have only played the current 1.06.  I also rarely look in the forums, so perhaps I'm less angry than some.  :)

Bottom line: if you enjoy city/base/island-building sandbox games, you will enjoy this.

I found exploring the game after a minimal tutorial enjoyable.  I had several false-starts and refined my base layout as I went.  Lost one decent early base when I learned the difference between tear down and vaporize: when removing a section of wall, vaporize removes everything including the floor.  Everybody was blown out before it could be repaired.

The graphics and animation quality are quite nice as are most of the sound effects.  The user interface is also easy to use in most cases.  It has a few issues when it comes to placing objects, especially ones that go on walls.  Even though they might be hard to see sometimes, the game does not allow you to use the south-east and -west walls interior (hidden) side for object placement.  Turrets are one of the few items that can face in any direction and it can be difficult to place the turrent as it will jump from wall to wall.  There needs to be a manual method to move the selection tile-by-tile.  It matters where the turret's cone of fire reaches.

The AI is perhaps not superb, but so far I haven't had any serious issues with it.  At least, not yet.  Pathfinding seems okay, as long as your base isn't riddled with paths because of doors everywhere.  Picking/keeping a good crew goes along way towards avoiding frustration.  You should also invest some time in keeping them happy.  It can be difficult sometimes, but all of the information you need it given in their tabs.

Sometimes, though, the AI will do something really stupid or annoying.  Like avoiding the conveniently placed fire extinguisher in the hallway and trying to stamp out the fire.  It seems as though the extinguisher must be within the room on fire.

Of course, sometimes it helps to discover or know the AI's priorities.  With builders, for example, it's rather easy to observe their work, or lack of it, and to figure out what they prioritize.  They tend to prefer building floors before walls, and walls before any indoor work, and so on.  So, if you have a room built and while waiting for it to be filled you plan on a new hallway, the builders will drop their indoor work and go add that new section of hull first.

The game's biggest flaw, by far, then is the lack of depth.  Except for the residence and pub areas, every room has only a very small number of objects that you can place in it.  Researching does not alleviate this problem as you really just get upgraded versions of an object or an upgraded replacement model.  That's not bad, but it would be nice to have a number of topics to research (maybe based on your contact with alien visitors) that would give you new objects to use in rooms or maybe even a new room type.

This lack of depth and seeming lack of forward progression after a point seem to be the primary reasons other posters give for giving the game a thumbs down.  These really impact the length of play and replayability more than they do playability, however.

If the poor description of the game that I've given sounds like a genre that you enjoy, you'll definitely have some fun playing.  For how long I think largerly depends on how much you like exploring the mechanics of the game while you learn to play.  Experimenting with various base layouts for efficiency reasons or asthetics also adds some time and depth.

Whatever the reason for DF ceasing development, it seems pretty clear that what has been delivered is a [b]*platform*[/b] for a game.  But, of course, they were supposed to deliver a game.  Fortunately, the platform seems to be robust and moddable and even as-is provides a good amount of fun.

Judging by DF's last announcement, I doubt we'll be seeing anything more from them.  I choose to be optimistic about the game's future, though.  The quality of what they've open sourced appears good enough that I think the mod community will add a lot to the game in time.  I wish DF hadn't dropped it, but they did and there are far worse states they could have left it in.

The game does provide some long term objectives conveniently located under the ""Goals"" tab of the main HUD.  They are more like milestones, however, such as getting X number of crew, surviving the Mega Fleet, or killing X number of raiders.

Finally, price:  It's definitely not worth full price given the lack of depth.  I would pay anywhere between $5 and $10 for it and feel that I got my money's worth.

If you're looking for similar games, I would certainly recommend either Startopia or Evil Genius.  Startopia doesn't let you build the base, but you fill it and manage the station.  It came out some years back so it runs great on most any machine and it's a lot of fun.  Evil Genius has you building a base in your island mountain hideout.  You get to design the whole layout, rooms and hallways, similar to base building in DF-9.  Evil Genius has a lot of depth as you take on nefarious missions or as you build booby traps into your base to catch unwitting good guys.

I hope this provides a sufficiently objective view of the game.  Keep in mind that I'm still playing and making ever larger bases, so it's possible that there are some issues I've yet to encounter because my population hasn't been large enough.

The graphics and animation quality are quite nice as are most of the sound effects.  The user interface is also easy to use in most cases.  It has a few issues when it comes to placing objects, especially ones that go on walls.  Even though they might be hard to see sometimes, the game does not allow you to use the south-east and -west walls interior (hidden) side for object placement.  Turrets are one of the few items that can face in any direction and it can be difficult to place the turrent as it will jump from wall to wall.  There needs to be a manual method to move the selection tile-by-tile.  It matters where the turret's cone of fire reaches.

The AI is perhaps not superb, but so far I haven't had any serious issues with it.  At least, not yet.  Pathfinding seems okay, as long as your base isn't riddled with paths because of doors everywhere.  Picking/keeping a good crew goes along way towards avoiding frustration.  You should also invest some time in keeping them happy.  It can be difficult sometimes, but all of the information you need it given in their tabs.

Sometimes, though, the AI will do something really stupid or annoying.  Like avoiding the conveniently placed fire extinguisher in the hallway and trying to stamp out the fire.  It seems as though the extinguisher must be within the room on fire.

Of course, sometimes it helps to discover or know the AI's priorities.  With builders, for example, it's rather easy to observe their work, or lack of it, and to figure out what they prioritize.  They tend to prefer building floors before walls, and walls before any indoor work, and so on.  So, if you have a room built and while waiting for it to be filled you plan on a new hallway, the builders will drop their indoor work and go add that new section of hull first.

The game's biggest flaw, by far, then is the lack of depth.  Except for the residence and pub areas, every room has only a very small number of objects that you can place in it.  Researching does not alleviate this problem as you really just get upgraded versions of an object or an upgraded replacement model.  That's not bad, but it would be nice to have a number of topics to research (maybe based on your contact with alien visitors) that would give you new objects to use in rooms or maybe even a new room type.

This lack of depth and seeming lack of forward progression after a point seem to be the primary reasons other posters give for giving the game a thumbs down.  These really impact the length of play and replayability more than they do playability, however.

If the poor description of the game that I've given sounds like a genre that you enjoy, you'll definitely have some fun playing.  For how long I think largerly depends on how much you like exploring the mechanics of the game while you learn to play.  Experimenting with various base layouts for efficiency reasons or asthetics also adds some time and depth.

Whatever the reason for DF ceasing development, it seems pretty clear that what has been delivered is a [b]*platform*[/b] for a game.  But, of course, they were supposed to deliver a game.  Fortunately, the platform seems to be robust and moddable and even as-is provides a good amount of fun.

Judging by DF's last announcement, I doubt we'll be seeing anything more from them.  I choose to be optimistic about the game's future, though.  The quality of what they've open sourced appears good enough that I think the mod community will add a lot to the game in time.  I wish DF hadn't dropped it, but they did and there are far worse states they could have left it in.

The game does provide some long term objectives conveniently located under the ""Goals"" tab of the main HUD.  They are more like milestones, however, such as getting X number of crew, surviving the Mega Fleet, or killing X number of raiders.

Finally, price:  It's definitely not worth full price given the lack of depth.  I would pay anywhere between $5 and $10 for it and feel that I got my money's worth.

If you're looking for similar games, I would certainly recommend either Startopia or Evil Genius.  Startopia doesn't let you build the base, but you fill it and manage the station.  It came out some years back so it runs great on most any machine and it's a lot of fun.  Evil Genius has you building a base in your island mountain hideout.  You get to design the whole layout, rooms and hallways, similar to base building in DF-9.  Evil Genius has a lot of depth as you take on nefarious missions or as you build booby traps into your base to catch unwitting good guys.

I hope this provides a sufficiently objective view of the game.  Keep in mind that I'm still playing and making ever larger bases, so it's possible that there are some issues I've yet to encounter because my population hasn't been large enough.

Another title that's a stain on the early access program. You'd think a developer like DoubleFine couldn't mess up a PC game like this. Just take everything from Theme Hospital, mix abit of Dwarf Fortress in there add abit of originality and hey presto, you have a game. Not really though, as you've come across the bad reviews/recommendations for this game and there's alot of them.

There's nothing good in this game, it's bare-bones as it comes. Unless a very, [i]very[/i] talented modding crew works relentlessly on this game it's [b]never[/b] going to be worth a purchase.

I'd just like to thank everyone who took the time to click on that good ol' green thumb and bring to light the trash that is early access and greenlight games. Thanks to Steams new refund option, broken, half made games like this will hopefully never come to be.

I cannot recommend the game as it stands at this price point.  Maybe if you see it on sale for $5 or so and you want to mess around a bit, but there's no depth of play here.

To me, it was like Space Colony mixed with a bit of Startopia, both games I absolutely loved.

I was very much looking forward to playing the finished game.

They never finished it.

Midway through alpha development they 'ran out of money'.  This resulted in them slapping a poor excuse for a tutorial onto the game and fixing only a handful of the hundreds of bugs the game had and releasing it.  They stuck around for 6 more patches fixing even more bugs, and the game still has dozens of bugs.

They released the source code expecting modders to finish developing the game and continued to sell it for full price.

It's still being sold, incomplete and extremely buggy.

This is the game that dragged Double Fine's reputation into the dirt, and rightfully so.

If you choose to give them money (or get it elsewhere, as it's essentially abandonware at this point), you will have a few hours of fun, especially if you loved management games of old; but play it longer than that and all you'll experience is complete frustration at the bugs and the general incompleteness of the game.  Every now and again I decide I want to play it again.. and can barely even get a colony started, let alone last more than an hour without crippling bugs breaking the entire thing.

You can pickup Space Colony HD for $2.50 (on sale) on GoG or Steam.  It's a much, much better game.  If you want something a bit different, Startopia is great too, but you'll need to get a widescreen FoV fix to play it properly on modern displays.

Update: There's a fan patch for the game that starts to introduce new features and attempts to fix some of the issues with the game.  Unfortunately, it has issues itself and neither experience is a very good one.  Development on it is also very slow as it's by amateur part time modders who seem to have issues every release (including just flat out missing files).

Maybe in the future it'll be well developed enough to actually fix and improve and add to the game, but as of right now, the game is still alpha quality no matter what.

*You have to actually plan a base and monitor your resources in order to survive
*Every play through is different.

   - Do you want a lot of hostiles?
   - Do you want to build your base close to a warp gate so you will have visitors (Friendly & hostile?)

*Yes, the game is no longer being developed
*Yes, there are many things not completed

   -Multi-level base construction
   -Teleporters

The game may not be 100% complete, but at least Double Fine released the source code to their fans to continue development.  Sometimes, it's the fans that understand the game on a much deeper level than the developers ever could.

I personally, would have expected a bit more out of the game.  If left as is, then I would say is better worthwhile in the $5 or MAYBE $10 price, but not the $20 unless more work is done for it.  I do not think people really mind spending more money on a game if the effort is put towards it."

The Tutorial stage is actually quite difficult for a newcomer - the 'area' the tutorial station is placed in has a 'high threat' level, and any time I tried to expand my station by adding a new feature, I found myself swarmed with raiders so that any residents I had out in space suits were inevitably killed. I cannot count the number of times my space station found istelf down to a tiny crew due to the rest being killed off. You will have much more satisfaction with the 'New Base' option.

This is a game with  basis, but too many frustrating points. What would help:

- the ability to 'jump' to a location on the map when a message is given, ie, a derelict has appeared, so-and-so is under attack, etc

- the ability to 'jump' to a resident from the roster

- a clearer indication of residents' moods and wants

- more options for decor/entertainment

- a help menu that lists the different features and what they do, instead of a too-difficult tutorial

- more features!!!!

On the whole, I know I will keep playing for the construction aspect, which is why I bought it, but I cannot honestly recommend it to anyone yet. Perhaps Double Fine will come back to it at some point; in light of the negative reviews it's getting, though, I rather doubt it.","[h1]Perhaps some should tell Double Fine a Tutorial stage is supposed to be easy?[/h1]

14430695,german,2015.01.11 13:06,❌,✅,0.5,0,"Spacebase DF9 ist icht wirklich ein schlechtes Spiel aber auch weit davon entfernt ein gutes oder gar komplettes zu sein, aber gehen wir es punktweise durch.

Erster Punkt und für viele sehr wichtig ist die Grafik. Die mag jetzt zwar keinen Preis gewinnen ist aber trotzdem durchaus angenehm anzusehen, mir persönlich reicht es. Allerdings stelle ich da auch keine so hohen Anforderungen, ich sage nur Baldurs Gate 2.

Zweiter Punkt der Content. Der ist dürftig, villeicht einem 5 Euro Titel angemessen aber keine 20 Euros wert. Klar man kann sich einige Stunden in das spiel vertiefen, nciht wie hier ein anderer gemeint hat das anch eienr Stunde alles durch ist. Aber wenn man will das alles gut läuft und auch ""Notsituationen"" gut übersteht braucht es schon einiges an Planung und leider auch Glück.

Das bringt und zu Punkt drei, das Gameplay. Im grundsatz ein solides System und leicht zu benutzen aber auch heftig unfair. Zum einem kanne s einfahc mal kommen das deine Leute Amok laufen (lässt sich verhindern) oder das eine Horde raider ankommt und das massakrieren anfängt (schwierig zu verhindern). OK man kann Phazertürme bauen, sogar außen, aber dafür fehlt dir am Anfang sowohl Material wie auch Zeit. Dazu kommen die Ereignisse auch in viel zu kurzen Abständen, man hat oft keine zeit einfahc maol in ruhe etwas aufzubauen.

Punkt vier die KI. nicht mehr so schlimm wie am Anfang aber immernoch grottig schlecht, mehr muss man da nicht sagen.

Fazit: Dem Entwickler kann man aufgrund seiner veröffentlichungs Politk des Spiels nur mit viel guten Willen keine betrügerische oder geldgeile Absicht utestellen und mir fehlt schlichtweg dieser gute Wille. Ist Spacebase DF9 deswegen ein shclechtes Spiel, nein ist es nicht. Ist es siene 20 euros wert, NEIN!
villeicht kann man sich bei 5 eurso überlegen dieses wenn auch unfertige und unfaire aber dennoch kurzweilig unterhaltsame Spiel zuzulegen, vorrausgesetzt man mag das Aufbaugenre.","Spacebase DF9 isn't really a bad game, but it's also far from being a good or even complete game, so let's go through it point by point.

The first point, and very important for many, is the graphics. They may not win any awards, but they're still quite pleasant to look at; for me personally, it's enough. However, I don't have particularly high expectations; I'm just talking about Baldur's Gate 2.

The second point is the content. It's meager, perhaps appropriate for a €5 title, but not worth €20. Sure, you can immerse yourself in the game for several hours, not like someone else here suggested, where you'll be done in an hour. But if you want everything to go well and even survive ""emergency situations"" well, it takes a lot of planning and, unfortunately, luck.

That brings us to point three: the gameplay. It's basically a solid system and easy to use, but also incredibly unfair. For one thing, it could simply happen that your people run amok (preventable) or that a horde of raiders arrives and starts massacring (difficult to prevent). OK, you can build phasor towers, even outside, but you'll initially lack both materials and time. On top of that, events occur at far too short intervals, so you often don't have time to just build something in peace.

Fourth point: the AI. Not as bad as it was at the beginning, but still abysmally bad, nothing more needs to be said.

Conclusion: Due to the game's release policy, it takes a lot of goodwill to accuse the developer of fraudulent or money-grubbing intentions, and I simply lack that goodwill. Does that make Spacebase DF9 a bad game? No, it isn't. Is it worth its 20 euros? NO!
Maybe for 5 euros you could consider getting this unfinished and unfair but still entertaining game, assuming you like the construction genre."

Of course, I'm not expecting this review to stay up very long- in a move guaranteed of course to even further please the irate buyers of this game, negative reviews of it are being deleted by the thousands. Because censoring the unfortunate truth is the best way to earn back respect, right, Double Fine?"

Táto hra ma sklamala. Očakával som od nej fakt hodne veľa, ale bohužiaľ ju developeri prestali aktualizovať a prestali na nej pracovať. To bola pre mňa rana. Akože, na úvod, všetko vyzerá že pracuje normálne, no sú tam malé chybičky, ktoré Vám znepríjemnia hru. Väčinou pomohlo zapnúť vypnúť hru a grafické artefakty zmizli. No niekedy sa stane že Vám umrie celá základňa plná niekoľkých desiatok ľudí, lebo Vás prepadli piráti a nikto nebol schopný ich zabiť. Ani Sekuriťák na najvyžiom leveli. Asi mal zlý deň tak sa flákal a skončilo to pre neho fatálne. Toto je faktor ktorý v hre obdivujem, ale aj kvoli ktorému som ju prestal hrať. Mal som už niekoľko hodín, možno aj desiatok hodín jednu a tú istú základňu, zveľadoval som ju, a odrazu sa vše pokazilo. A už sa nedala zachrániť. Myslím že sa tomuto typu hovorí Dwarf TD game. No nie som si istý. Hru síce vlastním no už asi nikdy nezahrám. Možno ak tak len kvôli videorecenzii. Takže jej dávam červenú kartu.","Hello steamers and steamers.

This game disappointed me. I expected a lot from it, but unfortunately the developers stopped updating it and stopped working on it. That was a blow to me. As, at the beginning, everything seems to work normally, but there are small errors that make the game unpleasant for you. Turning the game on and off mostly helped and the graphic artifacts disappeared. Well, sometimes it happens that your whole base full of several dozen people dies because you were ambushed by pirates and no one was able to kill them. Not even a Security Guard at the highest level. He must have had a bad day so he was slacking off and it ended fatally for him. This is the factor I admire in the game, but also the reason I stopped playing it. I had already had the same base for several hours, maybe ten hours, I was looking for it, and suddenly everything went wrong. And she couldn't be saved anymore. I think this type is called a Dwarf TD game. Well, I'm not sure. Although I own the game, I will probably never play it again. Maybe if only because of the video review. So I give him a red card."

Gameplay is utterly horrible. The interface is very clunky and you will be lucky if you actualy do get a base up to specs. 
To begin with the game is so full of game killing bugs that 9 out of 11 games I played were ended NOT because of a disaster, but because of  a major game killing bug.  I even had to restart the game 6 times in a row one time just because there was a bug that was killing it shortly after launching.. 

Moving on we now go to the general aspects of the game itself: 

Support 0/10

This game was released in an unfinished state and is abandoned yet sold on here for $20 (at the time of posting) 
I can not give a game in this condition or state any kind of rating at all.  Moving on, the devs are not freindly at all and have banned people for expressing their opinions that the game was a piece of vaporware.  You can take a look at the discussion forums for yourself on this and get a good idea of just how much censorship that is going on and make up your own minds on this . 

Graphics 5/10

I am really not impressed with the graphics.  They are not impressive at all and were somewhat below average. 

Sounds and Music 1/10

This is an area that is bare bones.  Obvioiusly this area of the game also did not get fnished.  What little music and sounds that there are  annoying as it is repetitous. 

Gameplay 1/10

I tried. No really I tried and I got 1 decent game out of 30+ hours which yielded  constant frustration from game killing bugs.  So I give gameplay a 1 because it was fun until the game was killed by a bug. 

Fun 2/10
What time I did play that was not killed by a game killing bug was fun so I give it a 2 in this area. 


Price:  due to the bugs, unfinished state, and unfrinedly devs it is my opinion that this is one game that definitely NOT worth more than a few pennies. 

Bugs and Execution:  The interface sucks, the game is full of game crushing bugs. 

I hope this review has been helpful to anyone looking for a new game. Feel free to comment.

Started playing about a year ago, during early access. Have played the game as it developed, up until 'official release'.

The theming and art of this game is excellent. It's cute without being saccharine, the dangers of space are presented realistically, which somehow feels acceptably couched within the hand-drawn avatars and cartoon 3d models. I love it.

The game starts off viciously (excluding the tutorial), dropping your three spacefarers off in the blackness with a small pod of resources and 8 minutes of oxygen. Within those eight minutes, you have to build a small space station that can support a oxygen-producer, and an airlock.

All my astronauts suffocated before I was able to do this, and it was excellent.
The game presented me with such a challenge, I was glued, it was excellent. The first time I successfully got my guys into that little pocket of safety, [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ny2E0BY5s-0#t=108]I felt like that scene from Gravity[/url].

And thus ended the difficulty curve of Spacebase DF-9.
From that point on out, excluding game-breaking bugs (to be addressed later), the game gets easier and easier. Your first foothold allows you to establish resource collection, you invest wisely, and eventually you have a thriving base of about 40 personnel, you've run out of local resources, and are colllecting recycled resources from passing derelicts.

Some playthroughs got to be so easy, I'd just start building massive space-station shrines, or just interior hallways that stretch across space to the next resource deposit, because it was fun.

Sometimes, I'd have enough surplus to just install double-walls around my entire station, so when boarders attempted their namesake, they'd just drill a entrance into the interior bulkhead.

There are some minor issues I have with infrastructure, for instance, for oxygen, the recyclers produce oxygen that free-flows through the station, but aside from that, there's no real way to control it. Usually it's best to center the recyclers in the base, and build the other rooms off as spokes, but if you have say, a long hallway, the oxygen just ceases to flow down the hall, since it's 'range' is too far. The addition of oxygen ventilation, and power conduits, would be a much appreciate increase in control and complexity.

This game had/has such potential, if well balanced and bug-fixed, but there are powers higher-up putting an end to that. Developer Double-Fine has recently seen a round of layoffs, shorty after CEO Tim Schaffer announced that production would cease on Spacebase DF-9. While I've not gone through the process of comparing Spacebase's credits with the current Double-Fine roster, the coincidence is certainly suspiscious. Double Fine, who since Brutal Legend have been relying on Kickstarter and Early Access to fund their products, may have found that charitable funds are not an effective way to bankroll game development.

Regardless, the premature cessation of development on Spacebase has it's noticable effects. Massive, game-breaking bugs still exist, that completely ruin the expierence.

For instance, technicians are tasked with repairing damaged or worn-down equipment around the base. At it's peak, I had around 20 assigned, and I typically ignore them, as they automatically prioritize things to repair.

Instead, I'm focusing on the Marines I've send out to a derelict to clear any threats. Surprise, surprise, there's a xenomorph on this derelict, and I haven't committed enough troops to deal with it. As it chases the final doomed marine around the derelict, it's tail flicks a door, damaging it. I sigh as I watch the marine die to the monster, when I notice that there's movement elsewhere in the derelict.

A conga-line of technicians stroll through the airlock, ready to fix the broken door. As the alien rears it's head on the first, I'm frantically trying to do anything I can to get them back into the main base. But it's too late. They're all panicked, and it's not like the game has any system to give independant commands to a single unit. I lose half of my base's population to bad AI. This is not a one-off; it has ended essentially all of my long-running playthroughs.

Other bugs exist, such as the game having trouble determining what is and isn't space, which leads to things like units being sucked through an interior doorway into a bedroom, only to hover there, trapped, as if it were zero-gravity, until they starve. Or the fact that something about scientists causes them to almost immediately 'go insane' when assigned the position, causing them to run around fighting other crew, and breaking things.

Some of these bugs may have been fixed since, but they were present in the game when it went 'Final', so I am writing about them here.

I really, really like what this game could be, and maybe mods will get it there. You'll noticed I've 'Recommended' it on this review; while it's certainly one of the most ambivalent recommendations I've given for a game, it's entertaining and unique enough to definitely be worth playing.

Get it on sale, though. And don't trust Double-Fine to not release another half-baked product... definitely wait until the next title is complete before putting cash down.","A pretty fun, unfinished, Sims-meets-FTL.

I played the game for over 32 hours, enjoyed it, and found it hard to put down... so I'd have to say overall I think I got my money's worth.

Compre este juego en early access, en un bundle que incluya algunos otros juegos de DF, el concepto me atrapo, y considere que valdria la pena. Estuve al tanto de los updates a traves de las noticias de steam, y en cada vez lo jugue. No creo haber jugado por mas de 1 hora en cada sesion. ¿Que es lo que Spacebase DF-9 ofreció cuando vio la luz como early access? Una idea brillante, un concepto original en un constructor de civilizaciones, con grandes promesas de expansión en terminos de jugabilidad, caracteristicas etc. Vamos, es Double Fine, Psyconauts, seguro sera un juegazo - pensé en su momento. ¿Que es lo que Spacebase DF-9 ofrece en realidad? No mucho. Admito que es entretenido durante un rato, desastres, piratas tratando de abordarte, capsulas extrañas apareciendo cerca de ti, otros astronautas, si si, eso esta bien. 5 horas despues, donde las mismas mecanicas continuan sucediendo, sin materia que extraer, sin un rumbo en especifico, sin siquiera objetivos inmediatos... Es entendible que incluso tu tripulacion quiera cometer suicido porque las maquinas de comida no tienen los sabores que les gustan. Abandone el juego hasta que vi que paso de Alpha a 1.0. Lo jugue nuevamente como 1.0. Y la sorpresa fue, que el juego era exactamente lo mismo. No mas, no menos, lo mismo. Mi conclusión fue, que el nuevo negocio de Double Fine no es mas hacer videojuegos, solamente proyectos kickstarter o early access de donde sacar dinero, para despues dejarlos a suerte de modders. NO VALE LA PENA, Y NO LO RECOMIENDO NI SIQUIERA EN REBAJA. Banished, o cualquier otro constructor de civilizaciones supera con creces este proyecto fallido.","This is my first time reviewing... I bought this game in early access, in a bundle that included some other DF games. The concept caught my attention, and I figured it would be worth it. I kept up with updates through the Steam news feed, and I played it each time. I don't think I played for more than an hour in each session. What did Spacebase DF-9 offer when it was released in early access? A brilliant idea, an original concept in a civilization builder, with big promises of expansion in terms of gameplay, features, etc. Come on, it's Double Fine, Psyconauts, it's sure to be a great game - I thought at the time. What does Spacebase DF-9 actually offer? Not much. I admit it's entertaining for a while: disasters, pirates trying to board you, strange capsules appearing near you, other astronauts, yeah, yeah, that's fine. 5 hours later, where the same mechanics continue to happen, with no matter to mine, no specific direction, not even immediate goals... It's understandable that even your crew wants to commit suicide because the vending machines don't have the flavors they like. I abandoned the game until I saw that it went from Alpha to 1.0. I played it again as 1.0. And the surprise was, the game was exactly the same. No more, no less, the same. My conclusion was that Double Fine's new business is no longer making video games, but rather Kickstarter or Early Access projects to raise money from, and then leave them to the luck of modders.

As the name suggests, Spacebase DF-9 is derivative of Dwarf Fortress, a city-building ASCII title that has absolutely no purpose outside of building your base and keeping it afloat until that sudden, inevitable downward spiral that brings your civilization to ruins.

It's a decent idea, for sure. I picked this game up as soon as it was available because I'd tried the Amnesia Fortnight prototype and desperately wished that it would be expanded into something great. The premise has a lot of potential, after all, with space being as vast as it is. Unfortunately, DF-9 left Early Access far less than what I'm sure a lot of people hoped it would be.

Spacebase DF-9 is a fairly simplistic base-builder sim. You pick a spot on a big galactic map and then build your fortune on it. Starting with only three people and some meager resources, it's your job to thrive in your little sector, mine up asteroids for more building material, and balance out the health and well-being of all the space grifters you pick up along the way. Sometimes you're attacked by bandits, or a bit of wrecked ship will float by for the taking. Sometimes you'll come across a particularly pushy visitor who insists on joining your roster. Sometimes you'll be stricken by a space disease and need to research the cure before it kills off your crew. That's about it.

The problem I've noticed is that there is really nothing in the way of depth. It's fine to be tossed into the wilds and learn the ways of the land by yourself, but once you've built one of everything you're pretty much done.  The happiness graphs and space social networking tabs might promise more to the individual psychological needs of your people, but there seems to be little to no chance of even the most dour, reclusive person on your base succumbing to space madness and striking out in a hilariously deadly rage. So that's one of my secret space fantasies rendered undoable.

If you want to build a space-base with a little more depth, I'd recommend Startopia. If you want to Dwarf Fortress, just play Dwarf Fortress. Unfortunately, Spacebase DF-9 is relegated to the Horrors of Early Access bin, which is a shame considering all that potential.","The problem with games that follow the lead of unfinished freeware games with incredibly good ideas is that when the original lacks a definitive purpose, the derivatives tend to as well.

Tim promised us a lot (most of which never made it to release), I was curious to follow the game's development, I rejoiced at every buggy 0.* version, but even after release, the game still remains a buggy, unplayable mess.

Path Finder doesn't work—in a game with indirect controls, that's unforgivable.

After a few hours of playing on a new base, everything falls apart, and it's not a matter of skill. Believe me, I've played enough to understand the mechanics. All questions should be directed at the game designers.

Terrible optimization—this game (running on Unity) lags significantly over time. Yes, my hardware isn't the best, but Bioshock Infinite runs smoothly, and then a slideshow starts.

As our foreign comrades say, save your money. And never sponsor games in Early Access.

P.S. The game's development has been abandoned, and there's no hope for improvement."

Alors moi j'aime bien ce jeu. Je ne suis pas un super pro du jeu, j'aime bien de tps en tps. Pour en revenir au jeu et bien je l'apprécie car il est calme et en même tps stressant par moment.
Par contre il ne vaut pas son prix trop cher.
Alors je mets un ""up"" car j'ai pas le choi de ne rien mettre, mais si je devais le noter je lui mettrais un 11/20.","Hello everyone.
So, I really like this game. I'm not a huge gaming pro, but I like it from time to time. Coming back to the game itself, I like it because it's calm and at the same time stressful at times.
On the other hand, it's not worth its high price.
So I'm giving it an ""up"" because I have no choice but to leave it blank, but if I had to rate it, I would give it an 11/20."

For those who actually want to read my review, I say in short this game is good if you like base management, but buy it on a ridiculous sale.

The last game I played that could be compared to this is Prison Architect, so I'll compare to that. This game has its ups and downs, but I found that Prison Architect became a bit stale after a while; build fast at the start, expand for new prisoners, work on efficiency. Rinse and Repeat. Not that it wasn't good, but that's the gist of it.

Spacebase Df-9 on the other hand, was a somewhat evolving base management, and a bit of tower defence thrown in when raiders visit too. Once you get the hang of it, you need to constantly adapt your base to make room for new people, keep up with the component decay and so on. One of the hardest bits (albeit interesting) I found was defending against multiple raiders. If you can manage to defeat the raiders, you're then left with a depressed crew (that don't want to work) that needs to repair the remains of the station and hold out until more people show up... or more raiders.

I honestly haven't seen any game breaking bugs yet (touch wood!). Bodies stick around for ages, but with enough doctors they get moved over time. Components decay rapidly, but with the right balance you can keep them in check until you research better things. And yes, research takes ages too, but it's helpful if you're around long enough to finish it.

All in all, it can be problematic, and there are plenty of issues people have talked about, but with patience and taking the time to learn the game, it can be pretty fun. Maybe a 7/10 from me, buy it on a very good sale.","Before you rage at me, yes there are loads of bugs, and yes the development is ""finished"".

It doesn't even have enough pretty distractions to make up for the spartan gameplay. This is the kernel of a game that could have been great, but unfortunately that game will never be completed.

On the plus side, Spacebase remarkably stable. I experienced no bugs, glitches, or crashes.

A tip for those frustrated by raiders: build at least one turret in every room and leave them deactivated when not needed. When raiders attack, simply activate the necessary turrets and seal the doors. No muss, no fuss. Don't bother claiming derelicts; they are difficult to defend. Rather, explore them to acquire new crew members or loot and then let them disappear.

In its current and final state, Spacebase is definitely not worth $20; I would not recommend this game at any price other than ""free"" (I got a complimentary copy with my Hack 'n' Slash purchase).","Spacebase does well enough for what it is - an alpha build rushed to release - but it lacks the strategic depth that a simulation needs in order to keep the player's interest.

First off, the tutorial lacks a lot of important information.  No mention that you have to build aesthetic stuff all over to keep up morale, no proper explanation of what most of the structures/objects do or why you should care about them.  I lost three bases to everyone flipping out on each other before I pulled up the (terribly-made) wiki and a starter's guide said to scatter cosmetic stuff everywhere to keep people happy.

The interface, while thematically good at first, gets very old very fast.  Every UI element is oversized, and everything flickers like an old TV set with every interaction, and everything has horizontal lines through it like an old computer monitor.  It gets grating and hard on the eyes rather quickly.  Event warnings on the right side of the screen can be minimized (usually), but not dismissed, even for minor alerts, or ones that no longer apply.

You have no direct control over the citizens of your station, which is fine, but it means that when they're all ignoring your orders - which happens fairly often - you can't do anything about it.  The closest you can get to controlling anyone is setting people to the ""security"" job and setting a beacon  - they'll jog over and stand near the beacon, but that's all you can do.  You can't prioritize commands, or set a ""do this first"" type thing on anything, so if you need a room built NOW, you have to go across the entire map and cancel every other build/dismantle task.  If things fall into disrepair, technicians take FOREVER to fix them - each time they work on something, they only improve it by a few percentage points, and then wander off again.  You also can't set anyone to do more than one task - a guy can build things, or repair things, but not both unless you constantly toggle his settings in the roster screen.

Raiders and derelict ships spawn far too often and too regularly - it's not at all random.  If you don't get ""security"" to respond in time to raiders, your citizens will just wander through and drop one by one.  Seriously, multiple times I've lost almost my entire station's population to single raiders because nobody has the sense to run away when they're being shot at, or security gets there one at a time and just drops.

A known bug (I'd say it's a bug, anyway) with derelict ships is that sometimes they'll just ""drift away"" with your people still on-board.  What this means is that the derelict despawns - taking your people with it.  This means you have to very quickly ""claim"" every part of the derelict to prevent that, at which point it's treated like part of your base - including constant alerts that it's not connected to the power grid, and citizens will wander over to it and just hang about, making it impossible to safely dismantle.  This also includes warnings about rooms on the ship not being tended to properly, even if you've already flagged everything to be dismantled for materials.  Heaven forbid you don't tend the garden on that ship you plan to scrap (by the way, it mentions this only in passing in the tutorial, but you NEED a garden - it provides food that doesn't eat through your resources like the food-dispenser does.  And you need a bar with full facilities to serve/store that food properly - also only hinted at).

Researching new technologies/illnesses isn't discussed at all in the tutorial, nor does it say how gardens work, or what to do with incapacitated-but-alive raiders.  It doesn't talk about building a brig, or whether you can ever do anything with these raiders - you only find out on third-party guides that EVENTUALLY these raiders can convert to citizens if they're confined long enough.  And your own citizens will freely wander through the brig, even if occupied, and get injured/killed by captured raiders.

""Passing ships"" also happen like clockwork, and get spammy.  The sense of humor in all the dialogue is great and everything, but it wears thin after the 200th ship in a 2-hour session, especially since most of the somewhat-limited encounter types seem to play out the exact same way every single time - either they give you more citizens, or they send raiders.  If you tell them to go away, they either go away, send citizens anyway, or send raiders anyway.  And you almost always know exactly what it'll be the moment it pops up.  Passing ships also turn off timelapse - you'll be going along at 4x speed to get something built, then it pops back to 1x so you can tell some guy to bugger off because you have no more room for more people.  And he may still send more citizens, in which case you have to quickly build beds/rooms for them to stay in or they'll start throwing tantrums and send station morale into the toilet.

I'm sure there are other issues I've forgotten to mention, but I think this gives a decent idea of how obnoxious this game is to play in general.","After playing for several hours, all I can conclude about this game is that it's [i]excessively frustrating.[/i]

Frustrierend war, dass man nur ein Spiel spielen kann; ist es verloren,.... fängt man wieder von vorne an. 

Doch nach 20 Stunden änderte sich dies und ich war motiviert trotz kurzem Tutorial selbst herausfinden, woran die eigene Spieltaktik nun wieder scheiterte. Toll fand ich den Humor im Spiel, auch wenn dieser leider nur auf Englisch sichbar wird, und das 80iger Jahre Design, welches mich an Babylon 5 erinnerte. 

Wichtig bei diesem Spiel ist es: Srategisch mit Energie und Alien-Skills umzugehen sowie die Medizin und Forschung nicht auf ""später"" zu verschieben! Dann klappt es auch mit dem Baseausbau und der Raiderinvasion.

The key to this game is to use energy and alien skills strategically, and not to put off medicine and research until ""later""! Then base expansion and raider invasions will also work.

Big discussions arose about the Early Access programm and kickstarted games. Leaving that aside I wanna focus purely on the game, that I got bundled in a Humble Bundle when it was still Alpha and played several times until its current version.

The premise and style of the game seemed enticing to me: Build and manage a space station with room for crew and their needs. I like space and sci-fi settings, plus the whole base-management had a Theme Hospital-like feel to it, which was also a great and creative game.

So I started out in space and began building. The game doesn’t offer a campaign, you basically free-build and manage your base from scratch. After a few basic rooms for living quarters, refining asteroids and oxygen supply your base begins to take shape. An intercom window pops up: other space drifters saw my station and want to join my effort. Randomized events like this keep things interesting and challenging. Not all encounters are friendly and you need to be ready for intruders - or pay the costs.

The building and managing is fun and keeps me entertained: There are some fun ideas in Spacebase DF-9 that I really like. Your base-dwellers for example post about their wants and needs in their social media “Spaceface”, where you can read how they feel and if they are happy with their occupation. The rooms and objects have good ideas that tie into each other: Plants can not only produce food but also oxygen. The food you produce can be brought into the pub for cooking. When fire breaks out you can not only use fire extinguishers but you can also cut off the oxygen supply to a room - though this usually takes longer and damages your equipment.

All these ideas and concept sound fun - on paper. In the game however they can get buggy and very frustrating. The power management for example can get very messy as the only data I have is a bunch of colorful lines across your base. I don’t see how much reach a generator has and how much power is being drawn. New derelicts appear out of nowhere that are so close to my base that my building plans are screwed. And several times my crewmembers kill themselves by simply staying in space until their oxygen runs out or not fleeing a empty vessel that runs out of oxygen. This is very frustrating and something that doesn’t feel like its the players fault. The build-queue is also not very clear as my crew builds rooms but just doesn’t make time to build the door that would connect them - ordering them useless.
All in all Spacebase DF-9 is a game that had great promise but will never live up to it because bugs ruin the experience. I tried, I spent the time to build a big base and train my crew to fight back an alien invasion - but when the same men later just suffocate by standing in an room without oxygen, I just feel like its not my fault, its the games. And I don’t want to play it any more.","Full Review:

About the game itself, people might say the following:
Remember the classic Dungeon Keeper, where you had to think through every room, separate the creatures so they wouldn't kill each other, make sure everyone was well-fed, etc.? Well, this game is Dungeon Keeper, but in space. But here you also have to monitor the integrity of your base, defend it not only from pirates who attack, but also take care of the base's integrity and the health of the base's inhabitants, otherwise you might get some surprises :3"

It's quite fun to play. I even think it's fun.

But the more you play, the more you'll be hit with unreasonableness due to poor resident password settings and insufficient development.

Even with security enabled to protect against space pirate attacks, residents are killed unilaterally.

What's more, space pirates come at you in a fairly unreasonable manner, all at once. It's frustrating not being able to deal with domestic affairs when you want to.

I think the reason Banished was able to make a smooth landing is because it was focused on domestic affairs and there were no external enemies.

If you haven't played either, I recommend Banished, unless you're a huge fan of sci-fi.

However, one good thing about this game is that the resident's personal diary entries have a wide variety of variations, which makes it quite fun in itself.

Spacebase DF-9 is The Sims, but in space. I know what youre thinking, I was hyped too. You can assign different jobs to different citizens and theyll like it a certain amount. Your citizens will scurry around and converse with each other about inane things like space mudcrabs. You can select asteroids to be mined, which works kinda. You can get other people to come by and ask to join your space-hovel, and supposedly they might even try to do other things, but that never happened in my playthrough. You can send you citizens to go and explore derelict ships, and they will find things. You can build rooms, and put things in those rooms, and your citizen will use them. You can give those rooms different named functions, and your citizen will use them for those functions. Spacebase DF-9 is The Sims, but in space.

Pros:

-Aesthetic: If you can count on Double Fine for anything, its that their stuff always looks good. The semi-retro looks of the interface and the hand drawn aliens look nice and stylized. Sending your citizens off to investigate a derelict ship is always a harrowing affair, as the ship is completely dark, with red warning lights flashing ominously through the hallways. Even if you have no idea whats coming, the atmosphere of the ship makes you anticipate losing a few citizens. One fult is that the play space looks very flat, even though your citizens, while in space suits, can go under your space-hovel, which was very confusing the first few times.

-Sound: The soundtrack is short but nice. Ambient trance music has a soft spot in my ear canal, but I found the music very nice, even though it will be seen as repetitive to some. If you dont like, it, you can always mute it and play Eminem, or what have you.

-Core gameplay: The game mechanics I described above are very good, and makes the base of a great sim game. I'll elaborate more on this in the negatives.

-Fun alien designs: I like the designs of the aliens. I didnt see two aliens who looked exactly alike in my playthrough, besides the two humans I started with. Reminds me of Star Wars!

Negatives:

-It isn't Psychonauts. Lets all face facts, the main reason we all buy Double Fine games is in hopes of another wacky, fun game like Psychonauts. It doesnt need to be a Psychonauts game, it just needs to have the same spirit (Although, I'm still holding out hope that if I keep buying DF games, they'll eventually make Psychonauts 2). The plain fact of the matter is that this has none of that spirit. Spacebase DF-9 is as sterile a gaming experience as there is to be found. The most funny thing I did was purposefully suffocate my citizens in the bar. Forshame, Double Fine.

-The gameplay is completely flat. As in grossly, sadly, boringly flat. If you have played 30 minutes of DF-9, you have played 30 hours of DF-9. With the exeption of the rare derlict ships, I spent most of my game watching netflix on the other monitor. Even the derelict ships suck in a way, since even with their mystery, it takes too much time and resource to explore and kill the monsters inside for it to be worth it, since all your citizens will be terrible at fighting. In other games, like the Sims 4, this could be remedied with patches and DLC, but Double Fine has no intention to patch or make DLC for this game, and so were tuck with the husk of a potentially great game.

Ending score: 4/10. A passable game that works just fine but because of its pedigree should be a while lot better than it is. If you really need your fix of a Space Station simulation game, try Space Colony on GOG, if you need a Sims-esque game, just go back to the Sims. If you want a fun Double Fine game, just play Psychonauts or Brutal Legend again.","Lets leave aside the fact that the game isn't finished, shall we?

- corpos que nunca somem e se empilham cada vez mais,
- torres de defesa que não acertam nada,
- pessoas que correm mais que phasers,
- ondas infinitas seguidas de inimigos até que sua base seja destruida,
- as pessoas estão sempre super infelizes, por mais perfeita que seja sua base,
- coisas que precisam de manutenção nunca são arrumadas pelas mecanicos e vão piorando até pegar fogo, mesmo que todos da base sejam mecanicos,
- material para mineração acaba e vc não tem mais como dar manutenção na base,
- muitos outros bugs menores que fica tão horrivel de jogar que vc desiste.

E não pense que está perto de arrumar não, faz muito tempo que ta assim e não tem previsão.

Espero que eles melhorem esse jogo, pois a ideia é muito boa e seria uma pena.","The game's concept is actually good, but it has a ton of bugs, almost intentional. They're bugs that make the gameplay horrible. The main ones:

- defense turrets that don't hit anything,
- people who run faster than phasers,
- endless waves of enemies until your base is destroyed,
- people are always incredibly unhappy, no matter how perfect your base is,
- things that need maintenance are never fixed by mechanics and keep getting worse until they catch fire, even if everyone in the base is a mechanic,
- mining supplies run out and you can't maintain the base anymore,
- many other minor bugs that make it so horrible to play that you give up.

And don't think they're close to fixing it, it's been like this for a long time and there's no timetable.

Als ich mir dieses Spiel kaufte (Gott sei Dank als Sale-Angebot) war ich total begeistert. Das Spiel ist so eine Art Sims im Weltraum. Man baut eine Station im Weltall, um dort Bewohnern ein schönes Leben zu ermöglichen. Schlafräume, botanische Gärten (um Nahrung anzubauen), Krankenstationen, Forschungslabore, uvm. lassen das Herz eines jeden Konstrukteurs höher schlagen. Dazu dann noch die Bewohner, die mit ihren verschieden Fertigkeiten und Vorlieben die Station bewohnen. Natürlich ist nicht alles Friede, Freude, Eierkuchen. Nein, hin und wieder greifen Piraten an, es brechen Feuer aus oder aber Asteroiden schlagen ein. So weit, so gut.

Aaaaber dann...
... ist DoubleFine der Meinung, dass es sich nicht mehr lohnt, dieses Spiel weiter auszubauen und man macht einfach ein letztes Update - und schwupp ... fertig. WTF?!?

Das Spiel hat noch so (unendlich?) viel Potential, um wirklich was großes daraus zu basteln. Aber den Entwicklern ist anscheinend daran nicht gelegen ... leider, leider.

Das Spiel - so wie es ist - macht Spaß, aber alle, die es sich kaufen, sollten sich im Klaren sein, daß nichts mehr hinzu kommt.

Daher würde ich vorschlagen, die Finger davon zu lassen, wenn man auf mehr hofft. 
Genre Fans sollten im Sale zuschlagen. 
Den vollen Preis würde ich auf jeden Fall nicht zahlen... und wie ich in meinem ersten Satz bereits schrieb: Gott sei Dank im Sale gekauft...

Meine Wertung:
Grafik: 5/10
Spaß: 8/10
Wiederspielbarkeit: 8/10
Langzeitmotivation: 4/10
Updates: 0/10

","Hey everyone!

When I bought this game (thank goodness it was on sale), I was absolutely thrilled. The game is a kind of Sims in space. You build a station in space to provide residents with a comfortable life. Sleeping quarters, botanical gardens (for growing food), infirmaries, research labs, and much more make any designer's heart beat faster. Then there are the residents who inhabit the station with their different skills and preferences. Of course, not everything is peace and harmony. No, every now and then pirates attack, fires break out, or asteroids strike. So far, so good.

But then...
...DoubleFine decides it's no longer worth expanding this game, so they simply release one last update – and hey presto... it's done. WTF?!?

The game still has so (infinite?) much potential to create something truly great. But the developers apparently don't care about that... unfortunately, unfortunately.

The game - as it is - is fun, but anyone who buys it should be aware that there's nothing more to come.

So I'd suggest staying away if you're hoping for more.
Genre fans should grab it during the sale.
I definitely wouldn't pay full price... and as I wrote in my first sentence: Thank goodness I bought it during the sale...

What Space Base DF-9 did right

 -Great visual Appeal

One of the things i love about SBDF-9 is the look and style, they just seem right. And it reminds me of the Sims 4 or Sim City(2013)



-Great idea for a game
lots of people have done building games, city games,etc, but Space Bases are few. The idea for this game is Perfect, now if only the game was...



What Space Base DF-9 did wrong


-Did not deliver
on the Double Fine Games website they had a roadmap (now long gone) of things they said they were going to try to add. It was a big one. And yes i know that even they said it wasn't ""set in stone"" but it was used to get people to buy the game, and now only about 20 to 40% of those features are in the game, and it kinda feels like they tricked us.

 -Left the Game unfinished
Double Fine Games the dev and publisher has left SBDF-9 to make another game and thereby make more money. They basically blame the community citing that ""not enough people bought the game to fund it"". Perhaps because the game is in an Alpha state at the most

 -retarded AI
I don't know about you but when i'm in a space base on the far reaches of the milky way, i get pretty damn pissed when i don't have Five Star meals, or Gyms, or bars, or TV. So mad i start trashing my own Oxygen tanks thereby killing myself. What? You wouldn't do that? Well the AI in this game does that. Yep, if they aren't living in luxury they decide life just ain't worth living.

 -Not Worth the price
If Double Fine Games was going to keep working on this, i would say this is worth the price, however they aren't so really there is no point in spending cash on it. Its not going to get better, its not going to get fixed, and its not a good game.

 -bugs and glitches that will never be fixed
Not being able to build, Oxygen not being produced despite the fact i have Oxygen tanks and more, these are bugs and glitches that will never be fixed.

 -Made us pay for their failure
This is more of a issue of Double Fine Games itself. They the whole reason they said the game is being shut down is because one: Not enough people bought it, and two: they ran out of Kickstarter money. If they did run out of kickstarter money then STOP working on another game and spend that money on the game you sold us.

 -This is not the first time Double Fine Game has let people down
Another game by DFG, Broken Age was also misleading. The game is sold as a full game but it is like TellTale games in that there are ""Episodes"". Right now, a year after the funding for the game ended there is only ONE  episode, with a ""promise"" that the second one will be coming on ""sometime in early 2015""

 Who Space Base DF-9 is for
-People who like wasting money

 -People who don't care about playing an unfinished game

 -People who buy games on sale

 -Idiots


Final Thoughts
The idea behind this game is amazing, and if worked on properly it could be a masterpiece. But it won't and thats a shame. Normally i keep supporting even bad EA games because i figure ""eh, they will fix it later"" i mean at the point i've already given them money, the best thing to do is hold on to the hope (however pointless) that the game will get better. There is no hope with SBDF-9, not anymore. And yes, modders could make it better, and they could make it a great game, but my belief is that if modders have to fix your game, and i mean Make it playable, then you've already failed.

Il y a extrêmement peu d'évolution, et quasiment tout les batiments sont disponibles dès le début.

Cela est déjà assez frustrant de jouer en English, mais en plus vous aurez le droit à des mots et des termes très difficiles à traduire.

A la version 1.06, le jeu est toujours plein de bug qui nécessite souvent de relancer le jeu.

L'équipage meurt sans arrêt, et les personnages se suicident 90% du temps. Le seul moyen d'arriver à tenir c'est par le méta-game. Vous êtes obligé de doublé/triplé vos murs, d'encercler votre base par des 10aines de tourelles. A la fin, le jeu ressmeble à un jeu de survie dans un tower defense.

Le jeu ne vos pas son prix, et je plains les joueurs ayant dépensé plus de 5€ en pré-release.","This is a graphically beautiful game, but it's sorely lacking in content and development. It lacks a story, or even a campaign. The simplicity of the system should allow for a multiplayer mode, which is therefore absent.

It's already frustrating enough to play in English, but on top of that, you'll be exposed to words and terms that are very difficult to translate.

As of version 1.06, the game is still riddled with bugs that often require restarting the game.

The crew dies constantly, and characters commit suicide 90% of the time. The only way to survive is through the metagame. You're forced to double/triple your walls and surround your base with dozens of turrets. In the end, the game resembles a survival game within a tower defense.

The game doesn't sell its price, and I feel sorry for the players who spent more than €5 on pre-release."

Raison autre:
Une multitude de détails montrant que le jeu n'est pas fini. Exemple: on assigne une personne pour  qu'elle se déplace jusqu’au lit de soin, cela ne fonctionne pas.

En bilan: ne l'acheter pas, même s'il est beau, même si les 10 premières minutes sont jouables, il n'est juste pas terminé et 100% de vos partis sont voués à l'échec.","A promising game that turns out to be very disappointing.

Reason #1:

The inhabitants won't defend themselves, which is infuriating.

Reason #2:
Someone, every 5 minutes, will ask to join you, even if you don't have the capacity, and often right from the start when your base isn't habitable!

Reason #3:
It doesn't matter whether you accept a new person on board or not, sometimes they automatically accept, without you being able to say anything or stop them.

Other reason:
A multitude of details showing that the game isn't finished. Example: assigning someone to move to the healing bed doesn't work.

In summary: don't buy it, even if it looks good, even if the first 10 minutes are playable; it's just not finished, and 100% of your games are doomed to failure."

out of 10 you're owed at least 30 Points, Why 30? because if you were owed 72 Points that would be sus with my Name.

Mit jedem Update wurde es natürlich besser und man kann nun enttäuscht sein, dass die Entwicklung nicht weiter betrieben wurde und offenbar vorhandene Ideen nicht mehr umgesetzt werden. Das Spiel als unfertig zu bezeichnen finde ich aber unfair. Die Spielmechanik funktioniert. Die Ereignisse sind bisweilen etwas arg zufällig, da kann eine nett gebastelte Basis ohne gute Verteidigung schon mal von drei bis vier Raiderschiffen zerstört werden. Wer Aufbausimulationen mag, findet hier sicherlich mehr als eine Stunde Spaß. Man muss sich eigene Ziele setzen und das Spiel hat kein definiertes Ende, aber das scheint mir so auch konzipiert zu sein.

It naturally got better with each update, and one might be disappointed that development was halted and that existing ideas were apparently no longer implemented. However, I think it's unfair to call the game unfinished. The game mechanics work. Events are occasionally somewhat random; a nicely constructed base without good defenses can easily be destroyed by three or four raider ships. Anyone who likes building simulations will certainly find more than an hour of fun here. You have to set your own goals, and the game doesn't have a defined ending, but that seems to be how it was designed. Certainly not a prime example of Early Access, but contrary to the misleading reviews, it's not a bad game either."

To be honest: I'm sick an tired of constantly being the alpha- or beta-tester!

The game lacks the very basics. You can only save your game by quitting. If you accidentally click on ""how to play"" or ""New Base"" you lose everything regardless if you have saved previously or not. You are not even asked ""are you sure?"" or be warned the your current game will be lost.

In terms of gameplay:
It is quiet unbalanced. Constant attacks don't give you much time to breath if you have not found the right area in the galaxy for building your base.

Sometimes ships dock at your station and there is nothing you can do about it. If these ships happen to have exterior turrets you might as well start from scratch. Because these turret will tear your crew apart and you won't have a chance to disable or even destroy them.

Again. Haven't the developers even played the game? Other players keep having the same problem. There seems to be no answer accoring to the double fine board.

You have to start over several times in the beginning until you have figured out what to do. There is a tutorial, but everything it does is presenting you a half finished base. There is nothing that explains the building items, what to take care of or the basics of managing the station.

Sometimes some of your citizens just stop doing their duties and telling you they are bored. You send security to a place where pirates tried to break into your ship and they just keep patroling the base. On occation citizens refuse to enter a room and do maintainance... which results in suffocation of all citizens on your station.

So, what do you do against those pirates raiding your base? You build some turrets of your own. Then one of your scientists goes mad, usually you would stop him and throw him into the brig until he stops acting up... but the turret has a better idea: it shoots him.

Conclusion:
Under no circumstance is this game in a ""release""-state! Beta at most. I feel violated as an alpha-tester again by a company which obviously did not even bother to try and play their own f***ing game! It reminds me a lot of the initial problems of X-Rebirth.

Raiders, space debris, nosy passenger ships, quiet derelict vessels, deadly diseases, and parasites that jump out of an empty husk which used to be one of your citizens. That's what you face when you become the Administrator of Spacebase DF-9. You will truly feel like the manager of a tiny oasis, alone in the vastness of a harsh galaxy.

To get a summary of what it's like to play this game, combine the play styles of a small-scope RTS like Age of Mythology with The Sims. Not only do you have to build, maintain, and defend a space station, but you must also make sure you're tending to the needs of your citizens.

Frustrations abound. Just when you have finally constructed a small, functional base, complete with power and air, your citizens will have the gall to ask for a place to sleep. Then, they'll want something to eat. Then they'll need a doctor. Then they'll want someplace to hang out with friends. Then your base needs a maintenance technician, but no one wants the job. Now they want a gym, but you're still trying to build the infirmary because two citizens died in the last Raider attack. But now there aren't enough power reactors! So you've zoned the construction to build a bigger power room, but then some Raider blew holes in your airlock in a firefight and now the whole thing is useless. But hey, at least he suffocated. Pompous jerk. Anyway, you've got to refit another room as an emergency airlock, to fix the airlock, so you can build the next reactor, to build the infirmary, and then ultimately build a gym, but darn it all, your Builder's feeling overworked so they went to bed! And NO, I do NOT want to answer your request to come aboard, random passenger ship!

In many ways, I find this game to be a very realistic depiction of what it would probably be like to lead your own vessel out in space. You have to fight constantly against the threatening, invasive, hostile environment, while not letting your crew's own loneliness overcome them. Think about it. Suppose you were one of your citizens: one of a group of ten people stranded out in, truly, the middle of nowhere, with no chance of ever seeing Earth again. No wonder my overworked builder is having trouble staying motivated, and no wonder most of my crew spends their free time in the pub. We all might want to think that living in space would be cool, but Spacebase DF-9 reminds us of the human element.

Yes, there are still minor graphical bugs, and sometimes your Miner will asphyxiate because they were too stupid to get back inside before their eight minutes of oxygen was up. However, no technical glitch any worse than this has happened to me in the time I've been playing; most of the frustrations are caused by realistic depiction of the situation. But like in Kerbal Space Program or any other pleasantly challenging game, when you overcome the trials of the moment, you will feel an immense sense of reward watching your citizens live the lives you have given them among the stars.

However these bugs and glitches are often game breaking and could even destroy your save.  That being said, don't buy this game unless you have a high tolerance for pain."

Below, I list the bad and the good aspects of the game based on my very short experience playing it (one hour is normally enough for me to make my decision, but I leave it up to you to decide whether it is enough to trust my review).

The bad:
- The AI of your colonists is not the best, but is getting better.
- The game becomes repetitive really soon (for me, it has after the first hour playing it)--there is just no hierarchy, almost no gradual development (save the research), and frankly not much to do as of now.
- There is no balance. I am pretty sure the developers got their inspiration in the Dwarf Fortress (where ""dying in fun"" TM), but I am able to play a game of Dwarf Fortress for days, but here my colonists die horribly within 15-20 minutes (raiders, fire or what not).

The good:

- The graphics are pretty good. I liked them a lot.
- The atmosphere of the game is its best selling point, IMO. Save the frustration of loosing each game I play pretty quickly, I like how the game feels. The colonists have their own characters, interact with each other and the environment, make friends and enemies--and all of this creates a feeling of a growing community in space, which is unfortunately quickly sent to oblivion, heh (see the balance).
- Enabling the support of mods is the best of the developers' decisions, which I think has the potential to save this game. There are mods already that address the balancing issues, and I am sure there will be mods fixing the AI, adding more things to do, and generally, adding depth to the game.

Despite all the drawbacks of the game, I still recommend it for one particular reason: it (still) has an enormous potential to grow into a fantastic game.

I understand the reasons for the negative reviews, but I also know that these reviews can eventually bring the development of the game to a halt. And this would be the most unfortunate turn of events, as the game, as I said, has the potential to become a fantastic game that offers its players countless hours of fun (and not frustration as it is now =) playing experience.

As for now, the price of the game is somewhat high for what it offers, so I suggest you buy this game on sale, and try it (with mods). I also hope more mods will be made for the game to enhance/improve it.","While I do agree with the negative reviews in that the execution of the ideas that could have resulted (and still can result) in a gem of a game is mediocre at best, I still cautiously recommend it.

Devs decided to leave development and game is maybe interesting concept but realisation just sucks.
AI of aliens in base gliches. Sometimes they stop doing things they are supposed to. Or they forget to come back to base to replenish oxygen supplay and die even if they were idle, without any task to do.
Commanded to tear down relict ship they go inside, take of spacesuits and then they destroy walls just to die of lack of oxygen. 
Even upgraded via laboratory security if not very effective vs hostiles. They also sometiems simply do nothing while getting killed. 
Rooms can loose oxygen without reason. Only solution then is to demolish it and build again.

Though if you don't regularly play management games, or want something somewhat simpler, this is for you. You may also enjoy this if you like making up stories for your characters, as there is a sort of social network generated for each character that you can kinda use to judge their emotional state.

It has several interesting mechanics, such as raiders which will stop by on their own ship, or derelict ships that will occasionally spawn. These become structures which can be salvaged or incorporated into your own ship, which can be pretty cool. The whole oxygen management thing in general is definitely my favorite part of this game. If you lose a wall of a room to a raider drill, meteors, or anything like that, your guys will be sucked out of that room, and oxygen levels will plumet. Its always fun having to quickly suit up some builders to patch a hole before everyone dies of asphyxiation.

However, once you get going, the game becomes dull. You can expand your base a bit more, make your people happier, defend against the occasional meteor strike or raid, and accomodate new visitors. But there aren't any complex industries to deal with once you get the basics down. I haven't touched modding yet, so hopefully something there will interest me. I'd really like to see this game grow into something bigger, but for now its just enough to keep some people alive. It would be awesome if we could eventually grow our little space station into a massive trade destination, or some kind of space gas station.

Overall, i'd suggest waiting for a sale. There are much more complete games you can be getting for 20$ (And if you want  an AMAZING management game, i'd suggest looking into getting a degree in Dwarf Fortress).

It’s in space, that part they finished pretty early on. The entire everything else part, the parts that involve managing a large, complex and interrelated system of many smaller systems all working together and against each other, that part they didn’t quite finish. Much of what was promised for Spacebase DF-9 was dropped just before release (the game had been in Early Access for about a year now). The game was given a half-decent tutorial, opened up so users could modify and “finish” the game themselves, and a few meta-goals were added to give the experience a bit of structure.

So what you’re left with is something that so painfully looks like the start of something great but then never actually goes there.  You can build your base, take on space immigrants, juggle their needs and desires, fend off raiders and explore derelicts that may appear. But it all feels pointless, unless you chase the arbitrary goals the team shoved in at the last minute, like “have a base with X amount of denizens”. It’s a pity the game didn’t get more support in Early Access, as a lack of interest from consumers is why Double Fine claims to have dropped the project.","A side-project by the venerable Double Fine, Spacebase DF-9 had ambitions of being “Dwarf Fortress but in SPACE!”.

- The investors love it and give Tim Schafer $400,000 to make this game.
- Tim Schafer gets addicted to cocaine and hookers and completely blows (heh) all of his investors' money, but just about this time Steam early access was hitting its stride and crafty Schafer cooks up a scheme.
- Tim Schafer puts a very early, borderline-developmental build of DF9 up on steam for $25 with a link to a web page promising tons and tons of features - all with a very nebulous timetable attached.
- A few months later (and a few inconsequential updates later) Tim Schafer finally cons enough money from hard-working people to pay back his investors (and get himself into rehab). Unfortunately, Double Fine is now broke.
- Tim Schafer announces the latest development build as the final release, takes down the webpage with the planned content, and releases the source code in a futile attempt to placate his former fans.
- Tim Schafer goes off to further bankrupt Double Fine.

tl;dr, [b]DO NOT BUY[/b].  This game is fundamentally broken and lacking in content.


I realize game development can be expensive, but I think it's pretty obvious from this and the Broken Age debacles that Tim Schafer isn't particularly good with money. Maybe Double Fine's next project should be an Excel spreadsheet so he can keep track of expenses.

Also, I really don't see how releasing the source code, or modding API, or whatever will possibly save this turd.  Modders are not going to want to spend time making a bad game adequate.  I think a complete rewrite of the AI should be the first thing to be done, but by the time they familiarize themselves with the code and rework the game, it'll be months from now.

This game had some real potential. I love playing it but without finishing the game properly you run into the same issue with every play.

You build, you research, and you run out of things to do. By the time you have researched all functional upgrades your space base is sprawling and you spend your time reassigning all staff to security detail when the multiple raider attacks start happening and then reassigning them back to their positions after the attack.

Eventually you cannot look in all places at all times and ""questionable"" things begin occurring when your not looking in an  aggravating attempt to ""fake"" difficulty ala' MarioKart.

The game itself is really not much more completed than what I played when I first purchased the Early Access version.
The AI is shoddy, the dialogue feels very much like placeholder dialogue, and there are items to construct that seem to have no real bearing on game play (can anybody tell me what exactly reactors do or why my turrets don't shoot raider ships out of the sky before they board?).

Feels bad to give this game a negative review, but it's earned it.","A real shame.

The space setting gives way to elements you won't find in most other colony planning games, such as oxygen management, exploring potentially dangerous derelict vessels, asteroid storms and chest-bursting parasite monsters, but common themes remain such as the importance of high morale and dealing with tantrum-throwing or fighting crew if that morale drops,  dealing with disease outbreaks and fighting off (or capturing and reforming) invading forces.

Despite the amount or complexity of content not being that deep, I've still found fourty-plus hours so far of thorough enjoyment through catastrophic failures and the desire to ""build it better the next time"", and much like in a Roguelike, I manage to do better, and make a spacebase survive longer, than each previous attempt.

I was a backer since the start. Although it had been left in a playable state, with the code made open source for the community to develop on, it's still a kick in the nuts that the game is left at only a fraction of what they promised Spacebase DF-9 was going to be.

Everything works you see, but there are issues:

-----

> AI are still dumb at times. 
I've seen people stand in a corridor when a meteor shower hits the base, or people outside the airlock suffocate because they're waiting in line and their suits run out of oxygen.

> Limited gameplay. 
Once you've built a self-sustaining base thats it. You're done. No more challenge outside of the occassional random events or purposely putting yourself into a situation.

> Limited reply value. 
You get one save file and one base, unless you manually switch them out in folders. Every replay is building the same base again until you come up with an efficient design that always works - its more of a time waster.

> No more official development. 
You'll recieve support, but any further addons are now in the hands of the community.

-----

If you're looking for a time waster with simple space-base building mechanics, then maybe this is for you. Its quick to load, with enough advanced features to keep things interesting while you don't have to micro-manage everything.

If you're looking for a game to compare to Space Engineers however? I'd suggest saving that money. You'll likely make one base or two, learn the mechanics, develop a strategy to quickly 'win' everytime and then get bored quickly.

Let's start out with management. Since the tiles you are working with is not directly underneath the stuff you're actually building, it's impossible to know if you're for example deleteing just this room, or also deleting the wall for the next room, which would mean all of the oxygen sucked out of your base.

Another thing is, that you can't move citizens around. This means, that you'll have to wait with (for example) destroying a room, because there are people in it. It can also be annoying, when you know theres a fire in a place, and you just have to wait until somebody discovers it. Even having the rooms alarm on won't help you. People only notices fires (and mostly also intruders), if they accidentally walks into them.

A third thing is bugs. There are bugs everywhere in this game. One bug happens when you have an intruder. You then mark the intruder with an icon saying ""kill this man"". Even if all of your citizens are security guards, they can just be standing, looking at the intruder destroying all of your reactors, and they will first react, when he actually starts shooting at them.
OMG thats annoying.
Another bugged thing is the airlock, the chamber between the base and space. Here you have two doors, that are never ment to be opened at the same time. Despite that, i've had a whole base killed twice, because the doors sudenly opens at the same time, and everybody is sucked out into space or suffocated. I've also tried people just standing in this room with the outer door opened, waiting until they die, and the door closes again.
AHHHHHHHHH

This is just some of the bugs i have experienced. Tough i've tried several times now, my best game has only been finishing my base, and starting to make research, when some stupid bug happens, or some superior enemies destroy your entire base in seconds.

幾個月後他們居然就從阿法版跳進了正式版 之前承諾的功能 從此消失

現在這遊戲成了個半殘的笑話

而double fine也為Early Access這個模式立下了天大的汙點...

看看MASSIVE CHALICE 他們號稱在kickstarter上已經籌足了資金

卻又想在EA階段上撈上一票~

官方卻聲稱""這遊戲已經接近完成 跟DF-9是不同的""

人說老狗總玩不出新把戲

但是double fine卻想又來撈上一筆

該死的Tim schafer...我被他之前kickstarter上的影片給騙了!

也許MASSIVE CHALICE 會走上跟DF-9截然不同的命運

I thought maybe it would be good in a few months. Looking at the list they had, this game would be fun, right?

A few months later, they jumped from the alpha version to the full release. All the promised features are gone.

Now this game is a half-broken joke.

And Double Fine has put a huge dent in the Early Access model...

Look at Massive Chalices. They claimed to have fully funded their Kickstarter campaign,

and yet they're trying to cash in on the Early Access campaign.

People are wondering if this is just another crippled DF-9.

The official claim is, ""This game is nearly finished and different from the DF-9.""

They say you can't teach an old dog new tricks.

But Double Fine is trying to cash in again.

Damn Tim Schafer... I was fooled by his Kickstarter video!

Maybe Massive Chalices... It will have a completely different fate than the DF-9.

I storm down to the storefront where I bought the not-brew only to find the signs down, the windows shuttered, and a note on the door: closed due to lack of customers.

Meine Cew prügelt sich selbst tod ständig, viel zu viele raider ( egal wo man startet)
die forschung funktioniert nicht richtig.

Man hat zwar als entschuligung ein anderes spiel noch bekommen, aber das macht es nicht besser.

My Cew constantly beats itself to death, there are way too many raiders (no matter where you start).

They did give us another game as an apology, but that doesn't make it any better.

In early Alpha, I did recommend it because it showed great promise and looked like it was going to be improved greatly as development continued.  As it was Double Fine - I had high hopes.  Admittedly, I probably shouldn't have gotten my hopes up for any game that is early access.  I highly encourage you to buyer beware for any early access games you may wish to fund in the future.

A note on the current status of Spacebase DF-9: It is considered, by the developers, to be complete enough for a full release.  Currently they're bug squashing and finishing some other small details on their development list.  That's it.  They're done after that.  There will be no future development done to this game for the foreseeable future, according to the developers.  They may not get back to it for at least 2 years, at minimum.  Buyer beware.

On to the review:

I have only played it for about 2 hours since it's official release.  While it still retains the charm and brutal difficulty as most games of this genre (ala Dwarf Fortress), there hasn't been that much added since the last builds of the early access Alpha.  

The graphics are passable, the sounds are passable, the text and artwork definitely has the Double Fine touch that many love and enjoy.  The actual game play and game design is a hollow shell, crying for more.  Should you survive for at least an hour to hour and a half, you will have built everything that is needed.  The rest of the game is simply adding more space for more crew members, taking care of their needs, fighting off the occasional raider/parasite, researching the lack-luster tech tree, and preparing for the “end game” fight with the raider mega-fleet (which also completes the game; I believe).  I'm unsure if the raider mega-fleet actually ends the game or just scores you as I simply got too bored waiting for the mega-fleet to show up.  I built everything I wanted, I raided derelicts for tasty materials, and I threw the troublemakers in my station in a brig or two.  Not to mention dealt with some of my own bugs that are still hanging around since the Alpha builds.

Amongst some of the issues with the game: No varied save slots for more than one base at a time, vague tutorial, unrealized or fully implemented concepts, inability to clean up blood stains (at least no way I have found out), questionable fairness (random spikes in difficulty or events that have no lead up; bad things just happen and they're absolutely devastating), and AI having no way to prioritize important tasks (so they just stand around building the room while they suffocate instead of building the single oxygen recycler they need to survive).

Elaborating on the unrealized/fully implemented concepts: There are a great deal of the beginnings of production chains, rooms, etc. - But they're just lacking.  All those things you would normally build in other games to fully flesh-out a production chain just aren't there.  You just build a room and get the end product immediately.  For example, instead of building a whole bunch of different machines and making an actual factory that takes raw ore, crushes it, purifies it, refines it, and then makes it into usable construction components – You just get a single shot “matter” resource that you use for everything.  The developers didn't want the game to be too bogged down in these systems, but you never need more than one type of room with their setup.  There's not enough décor for the rest of your base, so you're just stuck with single blocked out rooms at a minimum size to hold just what you want and that's it.  It just leads to boring designs and an uninteresting base to look at.  It's visually boring.

If you're dying for another Dwarf Fortress game, set in space – I highly recommend checking out Rimworld or even looking into Gnomoria for your Dwarf Fortress needs.

I'm talking about builders not building airlocks and dying from it, Techs not maintaining their oxygen recyclers, panicing when the lack of oxygen makes them suffocate, and then dies flailing around in circles - going into a raider/monster infested derelict one after another for the sole purpose of greed; the overwhelming desire to pick up some stupid, worthless toy and dying for it in a pile of their greedy dead friends, stamping on a roaring fire the size of a house and burning to death in a huge mass instead of using the fire extinguishers directly outside and in said flaming room - walling themselves into small rooms and dying, refusing to tear down the wall to escape or build a door,   Downright refusing to maintain the station, their lives, their jobs, or anything relating what so ever to order, because they'd rather bash each others brains out in some psychotic fight, or they'd rather have a temper tantrum because they need to keep the oxygen recyclers operational and they can't play with their rubber duckies.

Turrets have too short of range
Enemies outside of their ship have just as much health as the ships do...why?
Sometimes the lights of the base do not light up when you come back online

I chose the perfect sector 22-31 where the crime rate was supposed to be extremely low, after a few minutes of playing I get swarmed with raiders.

The game was designed with minimal resources as this game has no goal other than sandbox mode and build until the raiders come to destroy you. And if you do manage to thwart off the ridiculous amount of raiders, when you build a decent sized base I got a raider message saying my base was too large and I got swarmed by soo many raiders that even with my base being completely built with turrets on everyother outside block on my base that even this wasn't enough to kill those raiders.

Eventually the game AI will always destroy you so very un even programming.

There are not many options to customize your base with
There are upgrades but you have to find the plans to them on derelicts

Besides raiders in between those raids you have people parking their so called ships on your base and you eventually have to continually play cleanup where you kill the people aboard, select and highlight their ship and try and dismantle it, and once your done finally clearing away their junk it seems another NPC wants to park their ship on your base where it become permanently attached until you tell again your workers to disasemble it.

It might have had potential if the game designers decided to spend more time polishing it and expanding the way the surfaces interact...as in raider ships come in at some wierd xyz angle that looks goofy and unrefined.

Anyways there is more I can complain about but I would rather throw money at a hole in the wall.

I chose the perfect sector 22-31 where the crime rate was supposed to be extremely low, after a few minutes of playing I get swarmed with raiders.

The game was designed with minimal resources as this game has no goal other than sandbox mode and build until the raiders come to destroy you. And if you do manage to thwart off the ridiculous amount of raiders, when you build a decent sized base I got a raider message saying my base was too large and I got swarmed by soo many raiders that even with my base being completely built with turrets on everyother outside block on my base that even this wasn't enough to kill those raiders.

Eventually the game AI will always destroy you so very un even programming.

There are not many options to customize your base with
There are upgrades but you have to find the plans to them on derelicts

Besides raiders in between those raids you have people parking their so called ships on your base and you eventually have to continually play cleanup where you kill the people aboard, select and highlight their ship and try and dismantle it, and once your done finally clearing away their junk it seems another NPC wants to park their ship on your base where it become permanently attached until you tell again your workers to disasemble it.

It might have had potential if the game designers decided to spend more time polishing it and expanding the way the surfaces interact...as in raider ships come in at some wierd xyz angle that looks goofy and unrefined.

Anyways there is more I can complain about but I would rather throw money at a hole in the wall.

In the beginning, there was Early Access. In its Alpha build, DF9 AI was rudamentary. It made bad, often comically bad decisions, and it was like watching a child grow and interact with a world we knew it would adapt to. Like parents, we told our friends the marginally interesting tales of how the children stopped to chit-chat about Moonbeef and whatever while oxygen recyclers caught fire and firefights happened around them. And it was funny because we assumed that it would improve with time, development, and attention.

Then DF noticed. They thought this is where the charm of the game came from, and they pulled the plug. Our AI children stopped growing, and were now going to stay stupid. ""You enjoyed the stupid AI"", they say, ""and now that's where we decided to leave it."" 

We enjoyed the AI because it was temporary and had some amusing quirks in its broken state. Being forced to deal with the game in the shape that it's in is not fun. Building a base for inhabitants who don't know how to live in it is not a sim, it's an exercise in futility.","I'm going to focus on the AI aspect here.

But here's the gameplay review, if you're still wondering if you should buy it or not : 

The game's idea is wonderfull imo : build a base in space, maintain it and welcome new colonists into it while fending off raiders and managing the jobs the citizens do. The way they did it was not bad at all, simple drag-build controlls and assigning the different areas by a simple click of a button and design the interior as you like with various props. Easy. Simple.
But the thing that made the game bad is the fact that it's unbalanced, buggy and just unfinished.
The A.I is pretty bad in prioritizing their tasks, and with the new mood system there is just no way of keeping them happy, even if you furnish every room and give them their favourite jobs. they all eventualy get depressed and start fighting over nothing, which screws up the whole base and delays tasks as they recover in the sickbay.
The gameplay is refined for an Alpha at the time, but there was no change in it whatsoever when it went to V1.0 .

I wouldn't recomend the game to someone who disliked game-breaking bugs and dumb A.I , but if you just like building a base and dont mind using mods to fix all of the vanilla game's problems, it is worth buying whenever it gets on sale.
But otherwise, i sadly can'r recommend it, sorry Double Fine, but ya kinda screwed it up here.

The game it self has left early alpha and has became a full game already, now i will emit this game could of been worked on alot more then it currently is. The game many 'preset' areas that you can pick from, but each area is actually randomized as to how it's looked. i played in the same area two times before and the asteriods was layed out different, i had different encounters and much more.

        Now alot of people are non-recommending this game simply because they don't see it being complete. now i do slightly agree there, but there is alot in this game you have to spend time playing to actually find. one example would be there is more research than the ones you can get at the begining once you build a research lab. Random data cores can spawn with derelict ships which have random chances to apear. so you could get a late game research earily on or just get a low grade research.

        When double fine released this into full game, they had said it wasn't to the level they wanted, they wanted to do so much more with this game but they wasn't able to do it. So instead of just scrapping the game entire like some people believe they've done. They have actually given it to us... to the people of the modding community to create things for it that they would like to have seen in it. Many games have been made alot better thanks to the modding community, games that have had more things than this one even. Yet Double Fine has still been doing updates to the game to balance the game and less bugs to the game.

        As for actually gameplay, the game runs fairly smooth and there use to be many annoying things that happened in the game. But the game does have random generation, so you wont have the same game twice. one game you could have an entirely peacefull game, never running into Raiders, or Aliens let alone other things. while one game you could get hit near the begining and get slaughtered, Which this is slightly factored by your chosen start location, for some has more likely hood of one thing than another would. Example: One section has tons of asteriods and rare encounters, while another has medium asteriods and very common encounters. 

        all in all, i actually believe it's a good Space Station Building simulation game, that many people wouldn't of thought to make, the only real bad thing of this game is the Ai i will emit mainy on the builders, if you want to remove spot in a room or anything be prepared for massive pausing and quick selection, for they will try to kill them selves at times, though i have never had to unbuild anything, because i never seen a reason to do so unless i was doubling a room, which was easy to save my builders. If You think when placing security markers that something is wrong and your security isn't going to the location, it's because either 1. their asleep. (you can't wake them up you gotta let them sleep for as long as they wish). 2. you actually don't have any (pay attention to the jobs you assign) or 3. There is no phyiscal way for them to reach the location.

    I will emit this is the first time i've done a review for any game, but i believed i needed to after seeing so many negative reviews that was for reasons that in my opinion didn't fit as a good full on review of the game. This game is still a nice game to play on the side, and in my opinion once the modding community actually starts making mods and more if they haven't already, this game could become even more interesting just like Double Fine is trusting us to do.
i personally would rate the game, but i'm not good at picking right numbers to what i feel it should be, it's not a game you'll want to just spend hours apon hours playing, though sometimes when you start you'll get a bit addicted.. untill your space station is killed and you rage. but you can't live forever.","        This game was made by an interesting company called Double Fine.

So why don't I recommend it?
It's simple.  It's far too unpolished for a finished game.

Missing text, UI errors, and dodgy AI prioritisation.  The AI is good most times, but it has glareing holes where it puts things like ""stomping out fire on the other side of the raiders"" above ""the raiders are shooting at me, run away"" and you end up with ""look a fire behind those raiders that they just set that doesn't affect anyone, let’s get every civilian to run over to the raiders and stomp out a fire while they shoot us all""

My personal favourite is ""the oxygen recyclers are breaking?  No, don't fix them, lets panic for two hours while the oxygen slowly runs out""

Now you can put most people down to blind panic in situations like those, but out of a crew of 64, 52 of them went to stomp out the fire (they ran all the way from a safe section of the base, past security and into the raiders, most of which were assigned to security and tasked with killing the raiders.  You just wouldn't get a situation like that in real life.

I understand the reasons behind it, and the bug fixing is ongoing.  However in its current state it is still very very difficult to play smoothly, and I don't mean that the game is hard, I mean the game visibly holds you back when you want to play it and a single bug can be a game breaker.

If you like the look of this game, feel free to get it, back up your saves MANUALY on a regular basis, and don't be surprised if a sudden bug/glitch wrecks your experience.  However please don't buy this game if you are thinking it will be epic.  It's epic until a bug kills it.

Une brêche dans la soute? Tout le monde panique, même les réparateurs courent dans tous les sens et crêvent d'asphyxie.

Une attaque de pirate? Envoyez donc votre sécurité s'en occuper, ah pardon les devs ont oublié de leur donner des flingues, ou du moins ils ont oublié de coder comment tirer avec.

Vos bots trouveront le luxe de mourrir de faim dans la salle ou vous avez implenté un restaurant, vos mineurs ne rentreront jamais par le sas de votre base, préferant tenter leur chance en fracassant un mur, sans succès malheureusement. S'en suivra leur mort.

A breach in the cargo hold? Everyone panics, even the repairers run around and die of asphyxiation.

A pirate attack? Send your security team to take care of it. Oh, sorry, the devs forgot to give them guns, or at least they forgot to code how to shoot them.

Your bots will have the luxury of starving to death in the room where you've set up a restaurant. Your miners will never enter through your base's airlock, preferring to try their luck by smashing through a wall, unfortunately without success. Their death will follow.

In short, SpaceBase DF-9 shares one thing in common with Alien: in space, no one can hear you scream.

But as an objective player, you have to admit that you can have many fun hours with the game for little money, even if there's unfortunately not enough content to keep you entertained for the long term (20 hours or more). Hopefully, the community will help with that, too.

If you like to build things and enjoy the hustle and bustle on the screen (hello Settlers), you won't go wrong here for under €20.

Development ran out of steam (heh) in early access and developers pushed the game out the door instead of completing it.

The citizen simulation is half baked, they arrive on the station with set friends and enemies and then negative or positive interactions with set friends and enemies just serves to increase or lower mood. A few promising features were half implemented but went nowhere. Others, like religion, trading, burial based on religious preferences never materialized.

The bare bones structure is there, but for a game that tried to be Dwarf Fortress (DF-9, heh), it's missing alot. One resource to collect, there won't be any traders or materials to trade for. If you look at it as a tower defense game, it can sort of work, as random waves of boarders and raiders can test your defenses and one bad hull breach can doom your entire base, but that alone isn't worth it.

Exploration and randomly generated content is nonexistant. You get hostile raiders, meteor showers, maybe 12 different canned derelict ships will appear to explore, and immigrants. Features that never materialized: Sending citizens on missions to nearby planets, traders. You'll see it all in ~2 hours.

Overall I mostly enjoyed this game on the potential that it'll get better and seeing the new content in the monthly updates that used to come.

Wie andere Spieler bereits schrieben wurde das Spiel veröffentlicht, obwohl es sich kurz vorher noch inmitten der Alpha befand. 
Der Grund dafür scheint simpel. Spacebase DF-9 war finanziell nicht mehr tragbar für Double Fine. Das lag aber weniger an den Verkaufszahlen, als viel mehr am Missmanagement von Double Fine, was leider bereits mehrmals vorgekommen ist.
Ich war bereits ein Early-Access Käufer und bereits dort waren die verzögerten Updates und die Intransparenz ein Warnsignal. Schade es dieses Abenteuer so geendet.

As other players have already written, the game was released even though it had just been in the middle of the alpha phase.
The reason for this seems simple. Spacebase DF-9 was no longer financially viable for Double Fine. This was less due to sales figures, but much more due to Double Fine's mismanagement, which has unfortunately happened several times before.
I was already an Early Access buyer, and even then, the delayed updates and lack of transparency were a warning sign. It's a shame this adventure ended this way.

Und auch wenn es jetzt von der Alpha in die Finale Version geht, das Spiel macht nun mal echt viel Spaß...
Der Humor passt, die Grafik ist auch angemessen und auch die bisherigen Möglichkeiten sind ganz ok.
Und wenn die Mod-Community nach dem Release dann auch noch Content nachlegt, der ursprünglich geplant war, dann könnte es auch noch was mit Spacebase DF-9 werden.

Alles in allem ist Spacebase DF-9 jedoch nur zu empfehlen wenn es im Angebot ist bzw. wenn man echt Lust drauf hat und keine Alternative kennt.","I don't know why all the reviews here are negative. After all, we're not judging the business model or the developers' approach to funding their game, but the game itself!!!

The humor is fitting, the graphics are decent, and the features so far are quite good.
And if the mod community adds more content after the release that was originally planned, then Spacebase DF-9 could still be a success.

All in all, Spacebase DF-9 is only recommended if it's on sale or if you really want it and don't know of any alternatives."

Developers promised a lot of things, new features, customization, and a vast amount of gameplay.  Unfortunately, none of these promises were delivered.  I bought the game because I enjoyed Double Fine's Brutal Legend.  They seemed like a trustworthy developer that could get a fun quirky game done and make it worthwhile. 

After months of no updates and no communication I began to lose heart.  The minimal amount of playtime (logged 0.6 hours) was due to the lack of a tutorial (which they have since added, and it's sub-par) and (I assume) a bug that prevented my characters from entering the base I built.  I started another game, and again they wouldn't enter the base I built and ended up suffocating.  Started another game and I finally got them to enter the base, and that's where more bugs appeared.  Just read the forums to get an idea of how frustrating the bugs are and how broken the game is, despite it getting a full release.  

Very disappointed in Double Fine.  Their lack of communication regarding the game's development, refusal to be honest with people who bought their product (e.g. not letting us know they planned to stop development and leave the game as is), and the fact that they had the gall to release the code and tell the community that if they like the game, then they have to fix it.  Come on.  

To conclude, I'd say avoid this game, it will receive no further updates, and as it stands it's an incomplete mish-mosh of ideas.  Even for $12 I'd say skip it.  Hopefully they update Gang Beast, which I also purchased before this fiasco, although it hasn't received an update since the day I bought it (2 months ago).

Update: Source code has been released...and there are still parts of the code that are hidden, as one person on the forum mentioned, the Oxygen Recycler.  One of the most basic units of the game.  It's used to prevent your base from losing oxygen, thus preventing everyone from suffocating.

Update #2: Price has changed to $20.01 (from the sale price of $12), and that's about it.  Tried playing the game again and it wouldn't let me complete the tutorial (was not allowed to place a second airlock door where it indicated).  Still have yet to build my own base.  They supposedly also fixed some bugs on October 30th.  This is what one user had to say:

 ""crlsniper Nov 1 @ 2:30pm 

Glad to see your working on fixes, though the bigest fixes need to be AI fixes, Mostly for doctors and security. I lost an entire base just because none of the doctors would go help people who where incapacitated, neither would soldiers go arrest and move raiders who where incapacitated either.""

Multiple counts of the same complaint.  Furthermore, despite where you establish your base, you will have near constant attacks from pirates/raiders.

Some brave souls have attempted to mod the game (essentially having to rebuild the game from the ground up), check this thread out: http://steamcommunity.com/app/246090/discussions/0/613940477963640858/

It outlines a lot of the bugs and problems with the game, such as faulty oxygen recyclers (e.g. too many people in a room would cause dramatic decreases in oxygen no matter how many recyclers you had, thus everyone in that room eventually would suffocate).

Update #3: Free copies of Hack n Slash were provided to buyers of this game (myself and a few others received a copy), however it strikes me as more of a political ploy than a genuine apology.  This is because people who purchased Hack n Slash got a copy of this game.  As far as I know, Hack n Slash purchasers weren't spat upon and kicked to the curb by Double Fine, so this move makes no sense to me.

Now it's a year after the release date. they're advertising their 6th alpha which is already less than they previously stated and unless they offer an incredible amount of content in their next release they're offering a game that will let your base be built and let the residents lock them selves out and suffocate to death over the course of about an hour and a half.

So yeah, save your money, go to the cinema, for once it's better value for money."

The game itself is awesome. You run your own space station, and the game is executed with great sense of humour and is a truly fun game. However, at this stage it is not up to par with other management and RTS games. Main problem is the prioritising: if you said you want to build a room and a piece of equipment in another room. The game will build the room first and there is no way of manually prioritising actions. Also if a builder makes a bed and he is tired he will selfishly go to bed instead of finishing other beds, in some cases it is annoying. As a way of fixing the problem the workers should be clickable so that you can assign specific task to a specific worker if you want to. Also clicking on the equipment should show what it affects(i.e. oxygen in surrounding rooms) and how well it does it. Cancelling your actions is very hard, claiming wonky and if you assign a room with reactor to a farm or other type it will destroy the reactor instantly and kill everyone in the station if you have one reactor. Also the research projects seem to be impossible to start at this point. 
All in all the game is very detailed, nicely done, pretty and funny, but it is very unfinished and lacking in some of the most basic features such as prioritisation and control.
Sorry for bad spelling and idea expression.

If I were in Double Fine position, id drop the price to $5 and see if that could help generate sales.

This is why you shouldnt buy this game.
NOW as for why you shouldnt even play it. 
Its undercooked and unfinished and will never be finished,
the core gameplay that is here is lacking, and there are much better
management sims available than this, go play SimCity instead, 

The worst thing is, whats here isnt bad, its a fun game ( not £18.99 fun however) 
and there clearly was a lot of promise here, but it lacks a cohesive and complete design
a victim of the early access nature of the game, very basic systems were in place here
with no real central mechanics, while it is noticably graphically superior to 
the amnesia fortnight prototype, mechanically it is almost just as under developed and
after 18 months of development, a lot of promised features are completely missing.

interesting games, they absolutely shouldnt not start making a game that they cannot 
gauruntee to finish. Spacebase DF-9 should have never been greenlit, I love the idea but
the project completely failed, and Double Fine didnt gamble their own money on this, or 
even their investors money on this, they gambled OUR money on Spacebase. The game made 
its initial investment back pretty quickly, but due to a high price and lack of features

In any case, if it's the game that's having this problem, it should have been fixed a long time ago, and I think it's crap that it hasn't been done.

There was so much potential here, but as it stands the AI is a mess & it isn't possible to prioritise tasks so DF-9  becomes an exorcise in frustration.

Raiders are also occasionally very overpowered, a raider single handedly killed everybody in my base because all of my crew members seemed to just flap about and let themselves die.

Even if you get round these issues, there simply isn't enough to do to warrant a purchase, especially at the frankly ridiculous price of £18.99. I will never buy another Double Fine title again.

We'll leave a few nails and boards around, if someone wants to improve on things, though. Also, the president of the company is just as bummed about this as you guys are, except not really, because he's got a bit more money out of this deal!

DoubleFine was looking to cash in on games like Prison Architect. They even said as much themselves. They got investors involved (and successfully paid them off with the huge volume of Steam customers) and then when it wasn't as hot as they wanted, they cut development, did some more sales to lure in a few more suckers and then pulled the plug.

Most of the people who hadn't bought it yet were waiting for beta or full release, but DoubleFine wanted to make all their money up front. Their business model for this title depended on it, and it is a flawed and presumptuous business model that screws over the consumer.

Il gioco è rimasto in versione alpha per circa 1 anno e in questo arco di tempo non ci sono stati significativi sviluppi se non piccolissimi miglioramenti,giusto per rendere il titolo un minimo giocabile.
Non esiste un tutorial e nemmeno una ""storia""da seguire,cosa che a lungo andare(già dopo un'ora a dire il vero) rende il tutto veramente noiso.L'assenza di obiettivi rende il tutto davvero snervante ed è un vero peccato visto che se la Double Fine avesse fatto almeno un decimo di quello promesso sarebbe stato davvero un titolone!
Ultima nota proprio sulla casa sviluppatrice(per modo di dire)del gioco.
Sono stati davvero una delusione.Io come tanti ho acquistato il gioco appena reso disponibile su steam ed ho speso una bella somma,quindi sentirmi dire a distanza di circa 1 anno che non ci sono fondi e che lasciano il gioco in questo stato mi fà parecchia rabbia e di sicuro non acquisterò altri titoli della DF.
Dovrebbero vergognarsi e restituire i soldi spesi a tutti.Ora come ora questo è un gioco da non pagare più di 5 euro.
Vergogna!
Peccato...","This is my first review. I wanted to write it to let Italian gamers know more about this title.
A game that, at least on paper, could have had enormous potential.
Potential that, unfortunately, wasn't fully exploited. Actually, not at all!
The game remained in alpha version for about a year, and in that time there were no significant developments other than very small improvements, just to make the title at least minimally playable.
There is no tutorial or even a ""story"" to follow, which in the long run (after an hour, to be honest) makes the whole thing really boring. The lack of objectives makes the whole thing really unnerving, and it's a real shame, since if Double Fine had done even a tenth of what they promised, it would have been a truly great title!
A final note on the game's developer (so to speak).
They were truly a disappointment. Like many others, I bought the game as soon as it was released on Steam and spent a considerable sum, so hearing about a year later that they're out of funds and leaving the game in this state makes me very angry, and I definitely won't be buying any more DF titles.
They should be ashamed and refund everyone's money. Right now, this is a game you shouldn't pay more than 5 euros for.
Shame!
What a shame..."

First of all, this is practically a demo that absolutely does not capture what makes this genre ""fun"". Generally the interesting thing about base building games is not about how you can create a utopia where nothing goes wrong, but how your base will eventually come to its inevitable end. 

Spacebase DF-9 fails to spark any continued enjoyment because of how quickly one can create a stable base without having to worry about anything bad ever happening. One playthrough was all it took to figure out all the kinks for the next time, where it is entirely possible to reach a state where everything simply balances itself out. This can be attributed to the fact that the game has a very [b]short[/b] list of features.

The [b]short[/b] list of rooms have an incredibly [b]short[/b] list of items one can add to it, so constructing a base on the second playthrough provides almost the exact same experience. It is not surprising how shallow this game feels compared to other games from the genre, even before you are hit by the realization that the learning curve is really just a horizontal line.

The random events and the citizens ""dynamic"" behavior do not add a lot of variety, which is something that also quickly realized as you build your base. Understanding the patterns of the [b]short[/b] list of events the game throws at you does not take a lot of figuring out, which is not surprising given the fact that you can count these on one hand. To make things even worse, any negative event that can happen is easily preventable with the aforementioned [b]short[/b] list of items at your disposal. 

The only challenging element this game presents, is the incredibly stupid AI that is set on destroying itself as early as building the very first airlock for the base. God help them if they are apart of your mining crew and there happens to be two airlocks to your base, because they are more likely to asphyxiate in space than they are picking which one is closer so they do not die.

Again, all these negative aspects can be attributed due to the fact that this title is feature [b]INCOMPLETE[/b] and will probably remain so, unless it builds a decent modding community (which is incredibly unlikely to happen given the current state). The keyword here is [b]short[/b], as in the feature list, the amount of time this game was given development time until its ""full"" release, and any enjoyment you can get out of it.

I guess the project could be described as ambitious, but then again the same would be true for games like Prison Architect and Rimworld, both of which have been able to maintain some level of consistent narrative over a large number of releases (without needing to re-release every single version several times to provide hotfixes).

Some reviewers have said DF made the mistake of treating a supposedly indie, crowd-funded project as if it were another big team big publisher triple-A title.

If the game needs more than this kind of cash just to make it to 1.0-as-intended, maybe DF shouldn't have attempted to follow through with this idea.

В описаниях игры чаще всего пишут, что это симулятор космической базы и песочница. Ребята, не верьте этим людям - они в неё не играли. DF-9  - это Симсы в космосе. 

Игра сыровата, выглядит недоделанной, но не падает. Основной недостаток - крайне мало контента. Мебелей и шмотья, понимаешь, не хватает. :)

Второй серьёзный недостаток - отсутствие у игры цели, благодаря чему игра и попала в ""песочницы"". 
Это сначала, когда на базе шесть обитателей и всякий налётчик обидеть норовит, кажется, что есть куда расти и что делать. Но всего через пять часов у вас будет двадцать пять человек в команде, жить станет скучновато. Киллботы всё равно будут убиваться слишком сложно, а все остальные - слишком легко...  Впрочем, можно начать игру заново в более сложном районе, где рейдеры нападают чаще, а мирные путешественники, желающие обрести у вас на базе новый дом - и глоток кислорода - прилетают реже... Ну хорошо, вместо двадцати человек будет у вас пятьдесят. Кардинально от этого ничего не поменяется.

Игровой процесс начинается с того, что надо построить маленький космический домик на троих, причём успеть сделать это за восемь минут, пока не кончится запас воздуха в скафандрах персонажей. При этом надо уложиться в довольно ограниченное количество материалов. Лишняя площадь комнаты может вас внезапно подставить... и придется начинать заново. И не раз. На мой взгляд - это основной челлендж игры, что огорчает. Но читать туторы не советую - так будет совсем неинтересно!
Вики на сайте разработчиков почитать не помешает (потом, когда построите домик), но она слегка устарела, и это  тоже огорчает.

Впрочем, не всё так печально. Думаю, что со временем разработчики добавят в игру недостающее. В любом случае, мне она понравилась.","So, Far Frontier Space Base 9. Welcome!

The game's descriptions often describe it as a space base simulator and a sandbox. Don't believe those people, they haven't played it. DF-9 is The Sims in space.

The game is a bit rough around the edges, looks unfinished, but it doesn't crash. The main drawback is the extremely limited content. Furniture and clothing are missing, you see. :)

The second major drawback is the game's lack of purpose, which is why it's considered a sandbox.

At first, when there are six inhabitants on the base and every raider is trying to hurt you, it seems like there's plenty of room to grow and do something. But after just five hours, you'll have twenty-five people on your team, and life gets a bit boring. Killbots will still be too difficult to kill, and everyone else too easy... However, you can restart the game in a more challenging area, where raiders attack more frequently, and peaceful travelers looking to find a new home—and a breath of fresh air—arrive less frequently at your base... Okay, so instead of twenty people, you'll have fifty. It won't change anything fundamentally.

The game begins with you having to build a small space house for three people, and you have eight minutes to do it before the characters' air supply runs out. You also have to make do with a fairly limited number of materials. Excessive room space can suddenly give you a hard time... and you'll have to start over. And more than once. In my opinion, this is the game's main challenge, which is disappointing. But I don't recommend reading tutorials—it'll be completely uninteresting!
It wouldn't hurt to read the wiki on the developers' website (later, after you've built the house), but it's a bit outdated, and that's also disappointing.

It's not all doom and gloom, though. I think the developers will eventually add the missing features. In any case, I liked it."

This is a great start on the game so far. It can be a lot of fun, or really frustrating, but overall a satisfying experience if you are into roguelike games... and can handle some bugs that absolutely will kill you when they happen. Development of the game is a bit slow, but it's steady. I'm definitely a supporter of the game, and I definitely recommend it... so long as you're patient enough to deal with such an unforgiving game.

I don't think it will ever be an *easy* game, but due to some current bugs it can be overbearingly hard. The above video is the longest living base I've built so far. I played about an hour longer after the end of this video, and probably could have kept playing indefinitely... but due to some kind of bug my technicians just refused to do any serious work to repairing the base, and I got fed up with it. I've played a few more games since then, but most games don't last longer than an hour. When you do get that one game like this though, it can really make it feel like it's all worth it.","http://youtu.be/TH_L0-q7jiI

It can be a lot of fun, or really frustrating, but overall a satisfying experience if you are into roguelike games... and can handle some bugs that absolutely will kill you when they happen. Development of the game is a bit slow, but it's steady. I'm definitely a supporter of the game, and I definitely recommend it... so long as you're patient enough to deal with such an unforgiving game.

I don't think it will ever be an *easy* game, but due to some current bugs it can be overbearingly hard. The above video is the longest living base I've built so far. I played about an hour longer after the end of this video, and probably could have kept playing indefinitely... but due to some kind of bug my technicians just refused to do any serious work to repairing the base, and I got fed up with it. I've played a few more games since then, but most games don't last longer than an hour. When you do get that one game like this though, it can really make it feel like it's all worth it."

I bought into the Early Access alpha version of this game because at the time I looked forward to the initial concept of the game as advertised and had faith in Double Fine, developers notorious for several well-received cult classics including Psychonauts and Brutal Legend (controversial but in my opinion a very underrated game), to complete it on-schedule and more or less in a finished form of the advertised concept.

It seems apparent, that with the sudden push from 0.6 Alpha to 1.0 Release, that this will not be the case. From my experience, the game as-is is interesting but very buggy and sorely lacking in features. The base-building is somewhat simplistic, which, while partially due to the visual format of the game, is not enough to keep me interested in it. The AI for both friendly and enemy NPCs is very glitchy, hard to control and frankly suicidal at times. The user interface is clunky, incomplete and apparently designed for touchscreen support at the expense of UI size. The game has fullscreen support bugs, occasionally crashes without warning and lacks a tutorial.

Resource management is laughably simplistic, relying simply on the presence of basic station necessities (walls, furniture, life support, matter refineries, etc.) and NPCs in enough of a quantity to satisfy some invisible mysterious ratio (with the exception of oxygen/life support-based crew capacity, this is prominently displayed on the user interface, a very good thing). 

The long-term gameplay suffers when you take into account that there's a very finite amount of natural resources (called matter in-game) with which to build infrastructure and feed NPCs, which means you generally have to rely on proper choice of starting location in order to ultimately dictate how long you'll be able to keep your base going and how much harassment from raiders you'll get. In my opinion there's something wrong with the game when raider attacks are a promising sign of long-term survival after a certain point.

If derelicts are part of your chosen starting location, then, yes, ostensibly I could see you breaking them down for matter for self-preservation, perhaps indefinitely, but I have yet to succeed at this, either due to a lack of experience or simply because it takes too long, I don't actually know personally because it's completely up to the AI-controlled crew NPCs to do this after the order's given. 

NPC deaths (which happen often, due to only security officers being capable of self-defense if I recall correctly, and hardly capable at that) affect nearly the entire crew's morale directly and drastically and how useful they are in performing their tasks. This is apparently impossible to remedy (again, I may be mistaken). 

Even beyond these problems there's just not all that much to do, just survive as long as possible and assign new/current NPCs to station tasks and watch them utterly fail to perform them. Or starve to death because they can't find their way to the cantina because they're depressed and oversleeping. Or open up an interior door into a hallway with an oxygen leak and asphyxiate. Or catch themselves on fire and avoid several nearby, conveniently placed fire extinguishers, relying on other NPCs to actually see that their compadres are on a painful path from the psych ward to the burn ward and put them out. This all creates a bit of a death spiral for the NPCs, which is an interesting but infuriating and uncontrollable part of Dwarf Fortress, a game which Spacebase: DF-9's apparently inspired by.

To Double Fine's benefit, survival was one of the game's main selling points. Sadly, in its current state and potential state when released in 1.0, this may be impossible, or indeed, utterly futile and pointless to attempt from the outset.

Hopefully the game will improve once ""mod support"" is implemented, but it shouldn't take mod support for basic implementation of features and bugfixes to occur. 

It seems like the general consensus is that the game has been abandoned. I'd disagree with that verdict and give the developers the benefit of the doubt if it weren't so d**n obvious.

I do recommend to all early access payers, however, to recognize how frequently we receive products that are not even identified as ""alpha or beta"" and to be kind to double fine. I would suggest most players refer to many battlefield and call of duty releases to see how beta's can be pushed out as ""final projects"". Double fine has to begin to regain some form of capital from this project and the only way they can is by releasing the game.

+ Concept well thought out and fun

There is no real tutorial or guide. I had to go to the Wiki to figure out how to really get started. Part of this is not really knowing what to do and part is many of the things the game asks you to do are hidden about 4 menu layers down without telling you WHICH menu trees they are down. Once you know the trees, they make some sense but it is puzzling for new players.

The menu options need A LOT of work. It is not easy to understand what you need to do or how to do it. After you suffer through a few bad games of learning how to build an airlock, life support and the associated gear it starts to become fun.  Having the bulk of what you need to do hidden under several menu levels makes the trree feel lop sided. If I wasn't building a floor or wall, I was forever going down additional menus. 

Once you get past the start, it gets fun. Until you get a larger crew. Even if you give everyone the job they love to do, build all the comfort items and have everything you possibly can, your crew still gets depressed and sad. The crew want to be assigned their own beds but keeping track of who has what bed for 60+ people is not easy. Add to that the new people who come in and the people who die to raiders (or suicide in space) and you never know who needs what. The interface is increadibly clunky in this aspect. 

There is no way to direct anyone other than security and even then sometimes they just don't respond to a beacon. Critical structures that need building will often be overlooked for unimportant ones, equipment will remian broken while an army of technicians ignore them to chat with each other in the bar. This means the simultaneous building of objects is either best avoided (to direct workers to where you want them) or thrown to chance if something important needs to be done. Maintainence is best done by changin all technicians to builders and then reclaiming (destroying) degrading equipment and rebuilding it. When raiders approach, there is no way to direct non-security personnel away from an area. To be able to direct a worker to a specific task is such a basic tool it is amazing it has been overlooked.

There are some notifications (information) that should be alerts (clickable). What good is it warning me that I have an airlock somewhere I haven't built something in if you won't take me to it? This leaves you hunting down building errors, that may not be your fault, when it should be a simple click and fix. 

The AI is very stupid at times. Workers will starve to death while standing in front of a food dispensor. Builders will build themselves into a room and then suffocate because they can't get out. You can't even pull them out before they finish because you can't direct them. 

There is no screen rotation. Sometimes you will get missing floor tiles hidden behind walls. They may have been missed in construction, they may have come about from damage (fire, space debris). You can drop the walls most of the way but sometimes they can still hide. Being able to rotate the map would help this significantly. 

For something that borrows so much from RTS games, it is a game that fails to learn from lessons RTS games had to learn as they matured. As a result you get a game that could be (and at times is) increadibly fun but is severly hindered by its lack of basic features.","I've given this game a lot of time and it has the potential to be a lot of fun. It sufferes from some very serious flaws however. 

There is no real tutorial or guide. I had to go to the Wiki to figure out how to really get started. Part of this is not really knowing what to do and part is many of the things the game asks you to do are hidden about 4 menu layers down without telling you WHICH menu trees they are down. Once you know the trees, they make some sense but it is puzzling for new players.

The menu options need A LOT of work. It is not easy to understand what you need to do or how to do it. After you suffer through a few bad games of learning how to build an airlock, life support and the associated gear it starts to become fun.  Having the bulk of what you need to do hidden under several menu levels makes the trree feel lop sided. If I wasn't building a floor or wall, I was forever going down additional menus. 

Once you get past the start, it gets fun. Until you get a larger crew. Even if you give everyone the job they love to do, build all the comfort items and have everything you possibly can, your crew still gets depressed and sad. The crew want to be assigned their own beds but keeping track of who has what bed for 60+ people is not easy.

Builders lock themselves in rooms. Cannot place a door until room is built.

In one game got raided every 10 mininutes or so, astroids the same. It's not really fun after first 5 attacks, just annoying. I picked average for density and like almost low for (dont remember wording) for raiders. 

Tells me I dont have any doctors when I do have a doctor assigned. Tells me I dont have a tech when I have one assigned.

A pirate ship ""docked"" with me. I could not get inside the ship no matter what I did. I endeded up having my builders tear down half way.  The game crapped out on me before I could finish the rest.

I ""pacified"" a raider instead of killing him. I dont have a brig yet. He is now sitting in the hall way just staring at everyone. Everyone and a while I get an alert saying I am being raided. After this happened everyone started doing stuff even slower than before so I had to restart :(

People spend lots of time doing nothing. Right now I have 6 out of 9 people doing excerises and chatting in hallway. When I need something done in a hurry I just assign everyone. Like when a dude is about to starve because of being locked in a room. 

In the you tube videos people were joining left and right. I just have 7 people and no new people are coming :( I picked near to space gate or whatever when starting. 

Cannot scroll when constructing... This really sucks, literally need to cancel to close construction, scroll, and then start all over :(

The starting area selector thing is no good. Why cant it just be like minecraft where you can just pick easy, hard, flat, etc. Its adds no value whatsover having that picker thing with the map. Just annoying each time you restart and want to experiment with different world type.

The description of magnetic interfernce is caught off, cannot scroll, and I have no idea what it means in the game.	

Wanted to change roll of hallway. Building first generator, room was tool small, knocked down wall, built generator and built new wall that extended one block into hallway. Hallway become ""reactor room"". Tried to click on and change, instead clicked on unclaim by accident. Couldnt reclaim after that, lost all power and had to restart.

Builders get stuck in rooms behind objects. Need to knock down the wall to free them.

Twice at start of game, I finished my base with working airlock and life support but not everyone comes inside. They die outside.

A weird green line tripod/triangle thing appeared in the middle of base. Save/quit and restart and it went away.

In one game the refiner didnt work? The tech came around and repaired it but miners just came, stood next to it, and then threw there rocks on the ground :( Had to tear down and rebuild.

Twice this has happened, a reactor I built just disappeared. I placed in construction tool and confirmed. Didnt pay attention to see what happened.

It would be nice to have more than one save? Especially with a super buggy game like this.

Si tratta di una vera e propria occasione sprecata e nonostante gli sviluppatori abbiano deciso di rilasciare il codice sorgente del gioco per permettere ai modder di creare nuovi contenuti, tale comportamento non è affatto giusto, poiché non è compito di chi fa mod aggiungere quello che manca al gioco, ma degli sviluppatori, che continueranno comunque a vendere Spacebase DF-9 all'improponibile prezzo di 19,99 euro, come se fosse un gioco completo; tra l'altro, il prezzo della ""versione finale"" è inferiore di tre euro rispetto a quello pagato da chi ha deciso di supportare questo progetto fin dal suo approdo tra gli Early Access di Steam, e questo fa ben capire quale sia stata la qualità del lavoro svolto dallo sviluppatore, dato che le versioni ad accesso anticipato sono sempre meno costose di quelle finali.[/i]

[i]Spacebase DF-9 is a seriously inadequate title, not because what's there is poorly made, but because it's truly too little. It's a truly wasted opportunity, and although the developers have decided to release the game's source code to allow modders to create new content, this behavior is completely unfair, since it's not the modders' job to add what's missing from the game, but the developers', who will continue to sell Spacebase DF-9 at the unreasonable price of €19.99, as if it were a complete game; Furthermore, the price of the ""final version"" is three euros less than the price paid by those who have supported this project since its arrival in Steam Early Access, which clearly demonstrates the quality of the developer's work, given that Early Access versions are always less expensive than the final versions.

Double Fine dropped the game without finishing it. I enjoy the game and will keep playing it from time to time but I wish I could put a review up for Double Fine itself. Thanks to how they treated this game and their fans, they are black listed for me. I am more likely to pirate their programs rather than buy them but then again, I don't want anymore of their products in my libary.

First Review:

This game is a great time killer. I will fire it up, start playing and when I look at the clock i've lost 3-4 hours with out noticing. I'm not gona lie, this is one of the few games that can get me hopping mad. My tech guys will look at a broken reactor and walk away as the base loses all power. yM builders will go to the air lock get their space suits on, head out and look at the hole in the wall that I told them to fix, go back inside (with out fixing it) get out of their suits head to the pub and get sucked out into space. I'll have a hull breach with out a breach so all the oxygen gets sucked out and by people die. I've been pounded on my space rocks every minute on the dot. My people have lost their minds and started destorying the base. Raiders will bust in and shoot up the place without mercy... Yep. This game can get me really mad, but I still have alot of fun. Its in Alpha, there will be bugs and there will be progaming errors that make ya guys go mad. It all adds to the flavor of the game.

Man baut sich eine Basis im Weltall und wird insbesondere zu Beginn für jeden Fehler hart bestraft - baut man einen Raum zu klein oder zu groß passen entweder die Lebenserhaltungssysteme nicht hinein oder einem geht das Geld aus ... für Lebenserhaltungssysteme. Hat man es jedoch geschafft, die Lebenserhaltung und eine Raffinerie einzubauen, gehts entspannter zur Sache. Man baut also von Weltraumschrott und Spacepiraten geplagt, nach und nach eine Basis auf und dann? Das wars eigentlich, denn mehr passiert nicht. Hat man alle Räume gebaut und mehr als 10 Bewohner, ist so eine Basis fast ein Selbstläufer und man fragt sich, wofür man das alles macht. Die Bewohner bei Laune zu halten, sollte zwar ein Ziel sein, das Spiel gibt sich aber keine Mühe, einem zu sagen, was die Bewohner noch brauchen, dass es ihnen besser geht (das Interface ist in dieser Hinsicht auch die Hölle - um die Moral der Bewohner zu sehen, muss man mühsam jeden einzeln anklicken und oft weiß man danach nur, dass sie traurig sind, nicht aber warum). Klar, mit 1.0 kommen noch Ziele dazu und man kann sich einen schwereren Sektor suchen. Aber im Grunde fehlt dem ganzen Spiel die Tiefe. Da Double Fine ab Oktober die Betreuung des Spiels einstellt, ist auch nicht davon auszugehen, dass da noch Tiefe hinzu kommt. Wer einfach nur eine Spacebase bauen will und sie einfach immer größer machen will, der kann hier einen Blick riskieren. Alle anderen sollten eher auf Rimworld warten oder sein Geld in Prison Architect oder Startopia investieren.","What to expect: Basically, it's supposed to be a Dwarf Fortress in space with decent graphics, but it's far from that. You build a base in space and are punished harshly for every mistake, especially at the beginning - if you build a room too small or too big, either the life support systems won't fit or you'll run out of money... for life support systems. However, once you've managed to install life support and a refinery, things become more relaxed. So, plagued by space debris and space pirates, you gradually build a base and then? That's it, because nothing more happens. Once you've built all the rooms and have more than 10 inhabitants, a base like this practically runs itself and you wonder why you're doing it all. Keeping the residents happy should be a goal, but the game doesn't make any effort to tell you what the residents still need to feel better (the interface is hell in this regard, too – to see the residents' morale, you have to laboriously click on each one individually, and often all you know afterward is that they're sad, but not why). Sure, with 1.0, objectives are added and you can seek out a more difficult sector. But fundamentally, the entire game lacks depth. Since Double Fine will stop supporting the game in October, it's unlikely that any more depth will be added. If you just want to build a spacebase and keep making it bigger, you can take a look here. Everyone else should wait for Rimworld or invest their money in Prison Architect or Startopia."

Derlict games (a community team) has picked up the task of fixing what Doublefine left for us.
Progress is slow but allready with v1.07 and v1.071 the game is noticably improved. Many bugs are fixed and there are quite a few new structures avalible.

Unfortunately becuase Doublefine only released the Lua Scripting what can be done is very limited in nature and many aspects of the game are being rewritten from scratch to make them more eaisly worked with.

I dont reccomend buying Spacebase DF-9 [i]yet[/i]. In time that will change but there still are better games out there like Startopia.

Origional Review:
I previously had a negative review of the early access for this game due to various bugs, quicks and gamebreaking issues. I went into 1.0 with the intent of  viewing the game as a clean slate and giving it a fair chance at a positive review.

Unfortunately though nothing has changed.

The AI is terrible, and incapable of even the most basic levels of prioritisation. Crew will get stuck behind objects which is a new issue for the game this sort of thing wasent a problem in previous alpha releases. The initial seed powering system is still buggy. I had to rebuild the room around it 3 times before it registered leaving me with very little resources left to actually continue my station. The predicted resource gains from mining is completely inaccurate. It gave me an estimate of around 1000 or so and i got maby 200. The event system is still stupidly unforgiving and 9 out of 10 new game attemps will fail because of massive ammounts of meteor showers hostile invaders or generally just incompetent AI.

The only thing i can tell they did add was a tutorial that nobody wanted or needed. For all intents and purposes the description of the 1.0 update is nothing more than a lie, there have been no bugfixes, there is no new content.

Do not buy this game. No matter how much of a fan of this genre you are this game is not worth the cost. Dont make the same mistakes myself and the rest of the community that bought into this project.","Post v1.06 Update:

I had been following the progress for a while, and was hoping for a more finished product, but when I watched the Alpha 6 video from Double Fine, it looked like this update finally added some more content and there were also certain assurances from JP, the lead developer, that they would strive for better communication in regards to content and issues in the future. I decided to pay up and try it out. 

Well, it was still very broken. Aside from the known bugs that weren't resolved, the new ""mood system"" introduced some hugely game breaking bugs and it was hard to progress very far at all in the game without having to restart for one reason or another.
I frustratingly put the game down for the weekend, and only played it a few more times until they ironed out some of the more severe mood bugs by 6e-f.

The breaches could be a very fun aspect of the game, but instead balance issues make them either ridiculously easy, or painfully hard with no real explanation as to why one way or another.

This lead me to decide (as I have done with other Early Access titles) to ""put the game down"" for a bit, and come back later when they have added some more content to make the game more interesting and challenging to play.

This is a woefully unfinished game that is severely lacking in content. While the idea and core features seem real enticing, the truth is there really isn't much at all to do and I dont see the developer adding that much more before actual release.

I bought it late in the year 2013, maybe a month after it was available through early access. Initially the game was fun even though it was still broken in many ways.  However I'd just play a game once every month or so to see what they had added or fixed since my last run. 

I played around the middle of last month for the last time. When I played they had added a total of three new room types into the game since the barebones they had at launch. These rooms were excercise, science and medical. 

Excercise like it sounds was a gym, but it only has one single item you can place in it, a very boring gym machine, literally nothing else can go in there that actually helps your people excercise.
Science was pretty much the same. One big machine that is all you need, and some research projects that are very few in choice, and really don't add anything new to the game once completed.
And finally nmedical. Exact same deal, one structure can be built and only one, and its effect is negligible at best.

Long story short is this game barely had a years worth of development put into it, and is being released for a tag of $25 !?!?

Die Aussichten waren großartig: Eine Simulation sollte entstehen, in der man irgendwo in den ewigen weiten der Galaxie eine Raumstation bauen, Vorräte anlegen, Forschung betreiben und sich seine eigene kleine Welt aufbauen kann. Große Ziele und viel Content waren versprochen, und das Potenzial war grenzenlos.
So trat auch ich in das Early Access-Programm ein, um den Entwickler zu unterstützen.....ein Fehler?.....

Ich möchte ehrlich sein: Ich war von DF-9 begeistert, und bin es im Grunde auch immer noch. Für eine EA-Version war es schon ein recht ausgereiftes Spiel, dessen Coresysteme schon gut funktionierten, aber immer noch viel Erweiterungspotenzial boten. Das Anlegen von Räumen für die verschiedenen Bedürfnisse geht einfach von der Hand und lässt auch viel Platz für außergewöhnliche Strukturen. Das Ressourcensystem ist einfach gehalten, funktioniert dafür aber auch bei Anfängern. Die zufälligen Events wie die Ankuft neuer Crewmitglieder (sowohl freundliche als auf feindlich gesinnte) oder das Erscheinen anderer Raumstrukturen sind einigermaßen balanciert, und auch das Forschungssystem ist mehr Funktional als Schick. Die Bewohner der Station wirken schon einigermaßen intelligent und führen die ihnen aufgetragenen Arbeiten auch meist pflichtbewusst aus.
Natürlich, es gibt auch noch viele Balance-Probleme, unausgereifte Mechaniken und zahlreiche Bugs, Aber hey, das hier ist Early Access, da ist das vorprogrammiert und sollte nicht so viel Einfluss auf die Bewertung haben....oder?....

Warum es trotzdem keine Empfehlung von mir gibt? Ganz einfach; weil ich mit dieser Bewertung auch warnen möchte. Denn dieses Spiel wird die Alpha leider schneller verlassen, als uns allen lieb ist.
Am 17. September hat Entwickler Double Fine nämlich beschlossen, die Community auf den baldigen finalen Release vorzubereiten. Zuerst dachte ich, dass das eine GROßARTIGE Nachricht sei...bis ich endlich realisierte, was das bedeutet:
Es bedeutet nämlich, dass ein Spiel, welches zwar funktioniert, aber noch nicht annähernd perfekt ist, einfach so abgeschlossen wird, ohne Beta, ohne ausreichende Tests.
Das mag sich zwar nicht so schlimm anhören, es bedeutet aber das entwicklungstechnische AUS für das Spiel. Die komplette Liste der geplanten Features wird verworfen, und auch beim Bugfixing wird man sich wohl nur noch das nötigste erledigen. Stattdessen legt man das Spiel lieber in die Hände der Community und veröffentlicht den Sourcecode.

Man kann lange versuchen, sich diese Enzscheidung irgendwie schönzureden, aber am Ende kommt man nicht daran vorbei zu sagen, dass das alles wohl nur eine schöne Umschreibung der Aussage ""Wir haben keinen Bock mehr, macht ihr mal!"" ist. Böse Zungen gehen aber eher von ""Wir haben euer Geld schon, also Tschüss!"" aus.
Dazu kommt, dass diese Ankündigung nach EA-Version 6 kommt, die noch stark fehlerbehaftet und verbuggt ist. In einer Early Access darf sowas passieren; für die Tatsache, dass der Final Release bald bevorsteht, ist das wohl eher ernüchternd, und hinterlässt noch einmal einen stark negativen Eindruck.
Dazu kommt auch noch, dass das Spiel, was ab dahin wohl nur noch von der Community gepflegt wird, trotzdem wohl weiterhin 23 Euro kosten wird, was angesichts dieser Nachricht mehr als ungerechtfertigt erscheint.
So bleibt der Eindruck, dass man auf einen betrügerischen Entwickler reingefallen ist.

Ein abschließendes Fazit möchte ich an der Stelle noch nicht geben; nur soviel sei gesagt:
Double Fine hat sich mit diesem Schritt keinen Gefallen getan. Sie haben mit er Entscheidung, ein Early Access-Spiel so früh zu releasen und danach ""fallen zu lassen"" nicht nur ihren, sondern auch den Ruf des ganzen EA-Programmes nachhaltig geschädigt.  
Man kann nur hoffen, dass die oft erwähnte ""Betrugsabsicht"" doch nicht so stark beabsichtigt war, wie es sich jetzt für die meisten User anfühlt; sonst müsste man wirklich fast von Betrugs ausgehen.....trotz Early Access.
","After the fantastic game Costume Quest, which had kept me entertained for a long time, I was excited to see what Spacebase DF-9 had to offer. The prospects were great: a simulation where you could build a space station somewhere in the vastness of the galaxy, store supplies, conduct research, and create your own little world. Big goals and a lot of content were promised, and the potential was limitless.
So I joined the Early Access program to support the developer... a mistake?...

I'll be honest: I was thrilled with DF-9, and basically I still am. For an EA release, it was already a fairly mature game, with core systems that worked well but still offered a lot of potential for expansion. Creating rooms for different needs is easy and leaves plenty of room for unusual structures. The resource system is simple, but works even for beginners. The random events, such as the arrival of new crew members (both friendly and hostile) or the appearance of other spatial structures, are reasonably balanced, and the research system is more functional than fancy. The station's inhabitants seem reasonably intelligent and mostly carry out their assigned tasks dutifully.
Of course, there are still many balance issues, immature mechanics, and numerous bugs. But hey, this is Early Access, so that's inevitable and shouldn't have much of an impact on the rating...or should it?

Why isn't there a recommendation from me? Quite simply; because I also want to warn with this review. Because this game will unfortunately be leaving the alpha sooner than any of us would like.
On September 17, developer Double Fine decided to prepare the community for the imminent final release. At first, I thought this was GREAT news...until I finally realized what it meant:
It means that a game that works but isn't nearly perfect will simply be shut down, without a beta, without adequate testing.
That might not sound so bad, but it means the game's development is over. The entire list of planned features will be scrapped, and bug fixing will likely only be done to the bare minimum. Instead, they'd rather put the game in the hands of the community and release the source code.

You can try for a long time to sugarcoat this decision, but in the end, you can't avoid the conclusion that this is all just a nice way of saying ""We're fed up, you do it!"" But malicious tongues are more likely to say ""We already have your money, so goodbye!""
On top of that, this announcement comes after EA version 6, which is still heavily flawed and buggy. This kind of thing is normal in Early Access; Considering that the final release is imminent, this is rather sobering and leaves a very negative impression.
On top of that, the game, which will likely only be maintained by the community from then on, will still cost €23, which seems more than unjustified in light of this news.
This leaves the impression that we've been duped by a fraudulent developer.

I don't want to offer a final conclusion at this point; suffice it to say:
Double Fine hasn't done itself any favors with this move. With the decision to release an Early Access game so early and then ""abandon"" it, they have permanently damaged not only their reputation but also the reputation of the entire EA program.

One can only hope that the often-mentioned ""fraudulent intent"" wasn't as intentional as it now feels to most users; otherwise, one would almost have to assume fraud...despite Early Access.

It has a few clever ideas in there, and there is a very lovely amount of polish to the product--which is why it seems like such a waste.

I wish DoubleFine the best of luck for their other projects."

As it is right now, Spacebase DF-9 shouldn't be called anywhere near completed.  I mean, the game works and all but there are a lot of glaring problems with it.  After a few runs through the game, I couldn't help but notice that every space sector you play in has almost zero differences between them.  The astro density determines how much asteroid is in your area to mine from, which is appreciated, but it hardly makes up for everything else.  The threat level has very little difference, as it apparently suggests how often your base gets showered on by meteors and debris, while warpgate proximity indicates how often you get potential new residents passing by.  What is evidently missing is where Raider occurrences would be placed, since they happen fairly regularly.

The Raiders themselves are stupendously overpowered.  The raiding parties vary between one and three Raiders that *will* decimate your population, no matter how well-trained your Security staff is.  The reason for this is because they tank damage like it's nothing while killing a majority (if not all) of your residents in less than five shots each.  The defensive turrets don't offer much by way of defense.  As the camera is locked to only one perspective, you only have the option to face the turrets downward (i.e. towards the bottom of the map) to either the left or right directions.  Seriously, you can't really use them to shoot at the approaching vessels since they have to be *inside* the base.

The base amenities are also a joke as follows:
- Despite having oxygen capacity for X number of people, the second I fill the base to capacity, the oxygen recyclers eventually fail as if I was overbooked (despite each recycler to be working perfectly at roughly 80-85% durability).  This caused my residents to panic and run around, abandoning all jobs and waiting until they either starved to death (because they used up all of the matter in stock) or waited until the next Raider party exterminated them all.
- The bar doesn't offer much, since it's the only thing that works in the Pub zone.  I have seen neither the fridge nor stove used at all so they're essentially useless.
- I set up a Reserch Zone and set a tech to research but my Scientist was busy doing everything else while on duty rather than actually research anything.


Overall, the game pretty much sucks since each playthrough is just the same thing: see how big your base can get before Raiders kill them all.  And given how Double Fine's treating the game now, I'd have to agree with everyone else.  The developers are basically dropping the project and turning the rest of the game's development over to the community after announcing that they're releasing the source code for the scripts and pushing the game out the door with a 1.0 full release version.

I like that the game does not take itself too seriously. You got funny dialogues, weird aliens, and spacebook. It makes for a comfortable feel too it. The colors are vibrant and the interaction between crew members are kinda funny. 
The ability to create your own base and style it the way you want is also very interesting. It makes for a unique base layout each time you make a new game. 

And then there are the things that bother me. First, for a base that supposed to feel like home, there's very little items you can put in a room.

There isn't even any way you can recolor it so you're stuck with the same items in every room. 
Second, You can only rotate the camera from north to east facing. That will apply to every item too. It's really frustrating as it limits your design option.
Third, There are still a lot of bugs or unfinished issues (that they might address in the future) No matter what you do at the moment, your base will fail either due to depressed crew members that results into raging and destruction of rooms and equipment or raiders killing everybody even if your security personel had all the upgrades available.

""Double Fine has lost all of my faith. There is nobody to blame but myself, and I accept that responsibility, but I am also formally stating that I will not be buying any more Double Fine games. I should have seen the problem during the Broken Age development cycle. Even after fleecing thousands of backers on their Kickstarter project and earning an unprecedented amount of money for a single game development (ie. through Kickstarter, making millions of dollars), they failed to deliver a complete game. That was the first and only sign necessary, and I should have known then. 

Then, through their association with The Humble Bundle, they started making numerous other lofty promises - which I did not support based on the fact that they couldn't even finish Broken Age. However, somewhere in between all of that, and before the announcement that Broken Age was going to be released in two parts, I discovered Spacebase DF-9 and I really liked the look of it. Obviously, the folks at Double Fine were giving away keys like candy to every major reviewer and YouTube gamer out there, and the game looked like it would turn into something good. Unfortunately, although the game has evolved over that time since its somewhat buggy beginnings, Spacebase DF-9 still feels unfinished.

In the end, I realize now that I should not have supported Double Fine even though I believed that they were a studio of like-minded game creators and developers who loved games and were passionate about what they do. I was wrong, and spending money on their games is nobody's fault but my own. I do regret it now, but I've also learned from it and I promise never to make the same mistake again. I won't buy any other games made by Double Fine. I have nothing against the individuals at Double Fine, but it's blatantly obvious that Double Fine as a company, a studio, and a publisher, has mismanaged and misappropriated both their time and their money.

To think that Tim Schafer was waving wads of cash around (jokingly) after the first big Kickstarter, leaves me thinking that perhaps it wasn't a joke after all. Perhaps starting projects and then abandoning them, was all part of the plan. Maybe it was naive marketing and projection based on unrealistic sales forecasting. Or maybe it was the millions of dollars that were given, not only through Kickstarter but also The Humble Bundle, and at least a dozen other online gaming portals and retailers (including Steam), by the passionate gamers and hopeful individuals that wanted to see the ""small company in a sea of big fish succeed"", maybe all of that got to the heads of the people who are behind the decision making at Double Fine. Maybe it's one of those, or maybe it's none of the above. 

Either way, Iesson learned. I'm not going to cry about getting my money back, I'm just never going to buy another Double Fine game. There are too many other ""small"" games studios that thrive under tight budgets and that could actually use the support of enthusiastic fans and customers.""","This is not a review of Spacebase DF-9, this is a review of Double Fine and their recent practices.

So please, before judging solely on the fact that development was cut short, hear me out. If you wanna skip the points i will have a final verdict at the end

Pros
1. No preset rooms, you build how you want

2. Dialogue is rather humorous and reading people's thoughts normally gives me a good laugh.

3. The resource management is just right, not too complex, but not too easy either.

4. Since there are no templates you can really make your base yours. If you want the center of your base to be a nice dorm room thats totally doable. If you want to make it a huge club, all up to you!

5. The game keeps you on your toes and often provides great stories such as when one of my engineers went crazy and caught an oxygen recycler on fire and had to be taken down by security!

6. People interact and all have different opinions of each other. They may become best friends or end up knocking each other out!

7. Passing ships will signal you, you may recruit a bunch of aliens waking from their cryo chambers or tell raiders you're gonna kick their butts!

Cons
1. Raiders get a bit overpowered in later stages of the game

2. Morale is hard to regain after it drops and often leads to the end of your base

3. dialogue, while funny is quite limited. You will definitely see the same phrases more than once.

4. This game had insane potential, unfortunately many concept ideas that would have been great will now never be included

Final verdict: While it isnt a perfect game, spacebase possesses a lot of charm and an amazing amount of freedom. If you are a fan of sim games and think this may interest you, at least grab it on sale. Its a great sim game that has many disappointed fans who look at it for what it could have been rather than what it is","Though this game had its development cut short, which was admittedly disappointing, its is still a solid game and one of the better city sims I have played in a while.

For what little it is now worth, I did enjoy playing the game and exploring the changes in each new Alpha update. This game had a lot of potential and was very exciting. With gorgeous artwork, a decent attempt at UI design, atmospheric music, and an absolutely delightful sense of humour, all of which contributed to an interesting universe of different species and way of life. But the fact remains that this game was abandoned, never finished properly, and at the time of writing can not be considered a complete game.

They did go in and include a tutorial for the game, and I was very impressed with the tutorial until it suddenly ended. Although it felt like it ended abruptly and too soon, I can see why they did limit the information provided. If they don’t leave you to figure out the other rooms and the way the spacebase generally functions then you would have played all there is to play of this game in the tutorial. Ultimately the tutorial just seems to highlight the lack of depth to the game.

Spacebase has a rocky history so far, and I feel I really must include a discussion of this so that you can make an informed decision. However, as you will see with the format of my reviews, there are plenty of sections which allow me to consider the game for itself regardless of the surrounding drama.

In the interests of full disclosure: I was an early access purchaser, and yeah, I did get burned with this game. My experience with Spacebase truly set my mind to never buy an early access game ever again, no matter how wonderful it looks and tempting it seems. Nothing is a sure bet, and I will only be spending my money on finished products from now on. I can accept that I took a risk by purchasing an EA game and that it did not pan out in this case, but the end result is still a bad experience with Spacebase and Double Fine by extension. Things did get very dramatic, but I don’t think the company did a very good job of handling things. I’m not going to go on about it, so suffice it to say that I’m not an admirer of Double Fine any more. If you want more information regarding the drama I refer to, please check out TotalBiscuit’s discussion on the subject.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
This is a base building game. You build a space station from basic building blocks (floors and walls) and zone different rooms. You fill those rooms with things like oxygen tanks, plants, beds, exercise equipment, tables, food, defence turrets, fire extinguishers, science labs, and matter converters. Mine asteroids to refine into matter, the basic building block/currency of the game in order to build everything else.

There isn’t exactly a tech tree to this game, and there aren’t any crafting recipes (although there is scientific research). It seems to be more about the simulation of how people interact with one another, but there are so many characters that join your base that it’s impossible to really follow many interactions in a very meaningful way. So I end up concentrating on building the base and trying to see just how big I can make it. Once you get a vast crew though, things start lagging up and the bugs start to get obvious. Ultimately you will find that there is an imposed limit on how big a base you can create and keep running not by design, but because (I'm afraid I must repeat) this game wasn't really completed.

I really desperately wish that there was a blueprint function (like in prison architect) so that one could plan their base out before starting construction.

[h1]Controls[/h1]
Although you can use the mouse to do everything, there are thankfully plenty of hotkeys. Some of them aren’t as intuitive as I might like, but I got used to them over the course of many hours of play. I found the camera controls to be fairly good, with my most appreciated camera functionality being the ability to pan around. It’s also always a plus to have a simple pause/start button to hit, which is good old spacebar.

[h1]Storyline[/h1]
I can’t say there is much of a storyline. I think the original intention for the game was to immerse yourself in the lives of the different people on the base and sort of imagine your own story. However, there isn’t sufficient depth and breadth to the rest of the game to allow you to direct any sort of imaginary storyline. It was an interesting concept which didn’t really get developed or thought through well enough.

[h1]Sound[/h1]
I really like the sound in this game. The music is quite atmospheric (appropriate to the universe they created) and interesting to listen to. It may get repetitive after a while, but it is more like it fades into the background of your awareness rather than becoming irritating. Meanwhile, the sound effects are pretty much functional, nothing much to warrant remark.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
The artwork in this game is really very good. It’s certainly got a specific style to it, however that style is stuck to throughout and that consistency helps to establish a weird and wonderful universe. I really only have good things to say about the graphics, it’s a shame that all this creative work is now trapped in the wrapper of the rest of the game. Alas.

For those that are interested in seeing more of my reviews, I have set up an archive of them at an external website. I don't earn anything off of this at all, it's just a little side project that I add to when I can. Steam won't let me create a direct link though, so you'll need to make your own way to the URL I describe now: [b]rothana dot weebly dot com[/b]

In short, we feel betrayed. Not the end of the world, okay. We'll move on eventually. But we won't forget.

He did so, and although it didn't addrerss every issue I had with the way things were handled, it did address a lot of them and was an apology I felt was sincere. 

The harshness of my previous review was due to anger seeing an early access game come to a sudden halt (Tim Schafer does address the lack of communication and the lessons learned from this experience. He specifically apologizes for the communication issue which was my main problem. Had there been communication about the state of things before hand, I would not have been upset. I would have been sad, but not angry. So I appreciate the fact that Double Fine realized their mistakes and apologized for them.) -- it was not, and I feel bad for not making this clear in my past review, but anger clouded my communication skills... -- it was not a negative review targeting the quality of the game.

In fact, I really enjoy Spacebase, which is why I became angry. It's a game that from the beginning of early access, was getting things right. Yeah, there was rough patches, but the core of the game and vision was there and I was excited. And whether or not the finished game met all the ""features we want in the game"" dev list or not was not an issue for me. And my anger was not really aimed at the devs of Spacebase, really. I was angry at Tim Schafer. I'm stating this due to the amount of anger that has been directed at the developers. I think they've done a great job developing the game. Communication was not there. But that was an issue with Double Fine as a whole, not just this one development team. 

So, going from a thumbs down to a thumbs up becaue of an apology might seem odd to some people. And that's my fault for not being clear as to why it was getting at thumbs down. It's a good game. As it stands. And I'm sure it will be better when they release the last update. Am I sad that they weren't able to achieve what they wanted to? Yeah. But is the game bad because they weren't able to work on the game actively for a few more years? No. It's a good game.

I'll be curious to see what happens when the community has the ability to create mods and etc and curious to see how if Double Fine keeps an eye on things and maybe works out a way to be there in the form of a helpful guide to the community down the road.

Its fuckin horrible. Still buggy as hell. Still very little to do. The goals are pointless and more like achievements (get 50 people, kill 50 raiders, build every object).

My 45 minute experience on the new 'release' included such highlights as:

My best tech sufficating because they were outside shooting at nothing, and nothing that I did stopped them (changed role, cuff, send to infirm/brig)

The 'holdables' littering that map from the countless people that just 'died' for bugger all reason.

A part of my station catching fire, and 5 people dying because I locked the room down and opened it to space to clear the O2. What did everyone do? Jump in their suits and go around through the open door, start fighting the fire AND THEN GET OUT OF THEIR SUITS IN A ROOM WITH NO O2.

Fire animation remains after the fire is extingished. Now my base has a bunch of camp fires around it.

In a area with 'Very Low' raiders, had 10 raids between new colonists (not including the potental raids in the form of message that I know the answer to to make them not raid)

Colonists are still stupidly difficult to please. I have to click through 3 or 4 menus to figure out whats wrong with them.

Construction workers die pulling down a wreak because it had a alien in it. The alien attacked and killed a construction worker (who, I would like to point out I cant control to make him run away) dispite that fact that the 'room' the alien was in was open to space along the entire lenght of it. About 15 squares open to space. After killing my construction worker the alien ran FURTHER into the room, and only then was sucked into space.

Raiders still use the airlock, which means to beat them: wait until the raiders desuit in airlock > pause > unzone room > lock door to base > open door to space > they get sucked out. There is no reason at all to ever fight these raiders. This is the single best way to beat them. And it sucks.

Honestly Ive got like 100 more gripes just from the last 45 minutes I've been playing the new update, but I can sum it all up with:

Game sucks. Feel half finished (because it is). Wish I didnt buy it. Dont buy it.","Review for version 1.01

Spacebase DF-9 is an interesting play on the Dwarf Fortress formula.  Instead of carving out a kingdom from rock you are inversely adding a ""kingdom"" to the vacuum of space.  Similar to Dwarf Fortress you are given little control over your citizens.  Instead you play the role of macromanager, assigning citizens to tasks and watching them go about their day.  Certain events will trigger at random times forcing you to deal with raiders, parasites, killbots, and meteorites.

While all of this sounds fun in theory the problem is that Spacebase DF9 is competing with 10 years of Dwarf Fortress development.  As of Alpha version 6 there is still relatively little to do.  You can speed run through an hour of gameplay and basically see all that Double Fine has to offer, afterwards the game offers little reason to continue playing.  Unlike Dwarf Fortress, Spacebase misses the boat on simulated empire building.

Don't let my number of in-game hours sway you, 40 of those hours are from idling the game while I did work.","Developer Double Fine has posted that the final release of the game will be version 1.0 and that no more versions will be released.

You don't control the citizens directly, but instead you put down work orders, and the citizens will handle it on their own.  You sketch out rooms and order furniture and so on and your citizens place it.

The first few mintues of the game were a lot of fun for me.  You're kicked out of your life support pod drifting in deep space and have to build a little self sustaining environment with an airlock and some life support systems before your citizens run out of air (about 5 mins).  This was an encouraging first glance for me, because it's pretty hard and will probably require a few resets if you don't know what you're doing, and the systems seemed interesting and complex.  Eventually, though, I figured it out and started branching out, putting up a refinery to allow my miners to mine nearby asteroids, using the materials to build a residence and a bar and a garden and a lab and stock it with furniture.

And then the game ended.

I don't mean it dumped me to a ""game over"" screen or anything, there just wasn't anything left to do.  Once you've got a half dozen rooms down and functioning, which takes maybe an hour, there's nothing else you can do except wait for your science team to sloooooowly research some unnesescary upgrades, or maybe have your security team scrap with some raiders (note that this isn't an RTS, combat in this game is just a matter of setting a point for your security team to defend and maybe they will if they're not on break or hungry or tired or sad).  Sometimes a derelict will show up and you can... well, tear it down, nothing else to do with them really.

If you've ever played Dwarf Fortress, basically imagine that game but with no workshops.  You can make rooms and designate areas and place furniture, but there's no crafting system, no economy, no trade, resources are all boiled down to a single currency which is used to buy everything from walls to furniture.  The game just has no depth at all, and it's competing with some of the most complex and deepest simulations on the market right now.

The devs seem to have responded to this by ramping up the challenge, which makes things a bit frustrating.  Colonies can die from parasites before you get a doctor, waves of raiders can annihilate an underequipped security force, and once things start to fail, it's pretty much a chain reaction to an abandoned base.  Colonists freak out and refuse to do their jobs so vital equipment isn't maintained or repaired so colonists freak out even harder and things just spiral downward.  For example, if the air supply gets low, colonists will freak out rather than do their jobs, so if the area with the life support systems has air problems, you can't ever fix it because whoever goes in there is going to panic instead of fixing the air generator, and the problems get worse.  And this doesn't really do much to fix the problem with the game being short, because once you've got whatever it is you need to counter them, then they're not that big a deal.  

The 1.0 update added a lot of nice features, but the game still has serious issues with longevity.  There are still occasional glitches with draw order and some AI issues, but the game works pretty well mostly.  I've only played a bit, but pathing does seem improved and the interface does make things clearer now.

I don't want to sound excessively negative, this isn't the worst game ever.  I had a lot of fun with it.  It's just really short, and the asking price is kind of high.  On sale, for $5, I'd say this is a good deal.  At full price, I don't think it's worth it.  I'd recommend looking at something like Startopia or Space Colony or grabbing something like Gnomoria or Dwarf Fortress if you're not in love with the sci-fi aesthetic.

All of these games are cheaper, deeper, and more fun in the long term than DF-9."

I guess i should update this review now that the game has been released and has been updated to 1.05.

I still play this game, and at the time of the edit to this review, i've invested about 70 hours into countless new games. 

The updates have helped a whole lot, but the game still has some playability issues: 
Doctors will often ignore corpses, which leads to bad morale, which leads to violence which leads to drastic crew loss.

Raider events are too randomised, and can often lead to base failure in the very early game, or general drastic crew loss.

The added raider mega-fleet event is a good idea in principal, but is vastly over-powered.

Construction crew often take huge detors to the next block to be built when in space, which can lead to a new base failing, or causing unrecoverable crew loss in the very early game.

Even with my reasonable system spec and the relative simplicity of the game, it tends to lag-out far too much.

Generally; Base failure seems to be down to chance rather than skill.

[b]There are positives, however[/b]
There are mods appearing now, which is great. The community is addressing balence issues and adding reaseatch and similar. 

Workshop support is still very much missing, sadly.

[b]Overall:[/b]
Has the potential to be a reasonable casual game, but really isn't worth the full price at all. Perhaps at a quater the price, it woulnd't be so bad.","This game will never-ever be worth the full price now that DF have announced that they're abandoning development.

It simply does not work as a game. Stuff happens and your base will die, and there's nothing you can do about it. Just after the latest patch version, I lost an entire base to one raider, because the security team was either standing around and getting shot, or running away (and getting shot). None of them ever bothered to attack the intruder. Not even once. Your base will catch fire from asteroid impacts and your inhabitants will gleefully panic-run right into the flames and die, instead of grabbing the fire extinguishers you've placed across the base and actually doing something constructive. Someone will decide that they absolutely need to do floor pushups right in your airlock door, and then everybody will suffocate to death.

These things are quite forgivable in an alpha game. Frustrating, but understandable. It's alpha, I get it. Things might be broken or unfinished. I'm fine with that. But if ANY of this crap manages to slip into the 1.0 release? That's just garbage.

Do not give support (either financial or social) to companies that make bad decisions. And especially not companies that make bad decisions, then try to tell you how great their decisions actually were."

The devs just bailed on the game, leaving me with mixed feelings. Releasing the source code is kind of nice, and at the same time is quite useless in itself.

This is a game which was ""prototyped"" in a fortnight. Which meant it was written on a language enabling quick prototyping. In this particular case, Lua, which I don't think is precisely the best programming language to develop a project so ambitious as this one was sold to us as being. What sold me the early alpha back in October 2013 was the vision. If I knew the vision was backed by that, ehm, [i]questionable[/i] technological foundations, well, certainly my scepticism about the whole enterprise would have been higher.

On the other hand, the writing was on the wall for all of us to see. The development team promised monthly major updates and a continuous stream of bug fixes between updates. That development wasn't going quite right for this title was obvious when those updates started to lack regularity, at some point after February 2014, right after the ""Amnesia Fortnight"". 

Indeed, Double Fine seemed to forget about this one, since the fortnight turned out to be a couple months. Since then there have been ""major updates"", but to be honest, I am not sure that the new features added since May are that interesting, well thought out or functional, as the ""backbone"" of the game. Which I now reckon hadn't changed much between February 2013 and February 2014.

I'll look forward to the source code release. It will be good to see how things were implemented, and probably will inspire others to take up the concept. It will also, to be blunt, allow to rewrite the f*cking thing using tools actually meant for this kind of job (say Unity and C#, or Unreal/Cry Engines and C++). In that sense, hats off to the devs of Spacebase DF-9 and to Double Fine for putting this into the public domain. 

Of course, this last paragraph will only make sense to people like me, who understand and appreciate the real hackers' ethics. 

What I don't appreciate [i]at all[/i] is that this comes out of the blue, without saying a ""we're sorry but the early access revenue wasn't enough to support development"". Which would have been a very a straight way to approach the community, without giving excuse to people to think that they have been duped. I also see some astroturfing going on: it seems like some community management person is trying very hard to spray a giant smiling emoji on top this. And failures like this one are sad.

Очень жаль, но разработчики решили плюнуть на своё творение, и выпустили игру такой же сырой, какой она и была на момент ""раннего доступа"". Добавить к обзору, написанному тогда, мне нечего. Лишь то, что после её выхода я бы строго её не рекомендовал к покупке - выброшенные деньги, да и только.

[i]Данная часть обзора написана до официального выхода игры:[/i]

К сожалению, игра всё ещё очень сырая. Суть и идея интересны (естественно, тем, кто любит такой жанр игр), но слишком много мелких, но раздражающих недостатков. Нет более-менее детального обучения, которое позволило бы понять что к чему, иначе действительно приходится несколько раз начинать сначала и пробовать по-разному, прежде чем придёшь к какой-то стабильной модели развития.

Жители, отправленные на какую-либо работу, рано или поздно перестают её выполнять, даже при наличии острой необходимости. Брошенные шахтёрами на пол куски материи, которые после этого намертво привариваются к полу и не убираются, становясь частью интерьера. Охранники, которые при появлении вторженцев первыми кидаются наутёк, оставляя шанс сразиться мирным докторам и ботаникам (которые, при этом, умудряются побеждать!).

Перечислять можно много. В целом, игру можно порекомендовать, но как мне кажется, лучше дождаться выхода хотя бы Beta-версии, потому что это желание возникает почти сразу после пары часов игры.","[i]This part of the review was written after the game's official release:[/i]

It's a shame, but the developers decided to abandon their creation and released the game as unpolished as it was when it entered Early Access. I have nothing to add to the review I wrote back then. I would strongly advise against purchasing it after its release – it's a complete waste of money.

[i]This part of the review was written before the game's official release:[/i]

Unfortunately, the game is still very rough. The core and concept are interesting (naturally, for those who enjoy this genre of games), but there are too many small but annoying flaws. There's no detailed tutorial to help you understand the basics; otherwise, you'll have to start over several times and try different approaches before you find a stable development model.

Citizens assigned to a particular job sooner or later stop doing it, even when absolutely necessary. Pieces of fabric thrown on the floor by miners, which are then welded to the floor and cannot be removed, becoming part of the interior. Guards who, when invaders appear, are the first to run, leaving the peaceful doctors and botanists a fighting chance (who, incidentally, manage to win!).

There are many more to list. Overall, the game is highly recommended, but I think it's best to wait for at least the Beta version, as the urge to play kicks in almost immediately after a couple of hours of play."

It was really hard deciding whether to recommend it or not. Here's why I decided not to (followed by what I like):

At its current state (Alpha 6e) there are a few bugs I consider gamebreaking.
1. When exploring a derelict that for various reasons doesn't refill it's oxygen, citizens will walk around and even go there (!) - like technicians wanting to fix something, botanists if there is a garden, etc - until the oxygen is low at which point they start running around panicked. With no way to add oxygen, they do this until they die, often wiping out most or all of my security crew, along with a couple of other idiots who went there.

2. I can't seem to get them to calm down after throwing a tantrum. Most of the time, they wake up (or when they're released from the brig) and throw another. Rinse and repeat until someone kills them.

3. Technicians are quite useless at their work (which goes for all citizens, really, but it's most noticeable with the technicians). It takes forever to fix something.

4. (Related to 2) It's too damn hard keeping your crew happy. I just can't seem to do it, at all! 

Ok, so that's why I would not recommend the game at this point. If these things are fixed in a coming update, however, I would definitely recommend it! Here's why:

I really like the challenge it is to build a base in space. Things like broken or incomplete walls are suddenly a major deal. It's fun with the research letting you get better and I like that there are derelicts appearing that you can explore. I see much promise in this game and think it can get really good once the team has had a chance to develope it a bit further.","Edit: I just found this amazing game Space Haven that has the potential to be everything SpaceBase DF9 should've been, and more!

Принцп прост. Построй свою космобазу, засели ее существами, назнач их на определенную должность и сохрани им всем жизнь и развлекать не забывай. Звучит просто. На деле нужно запороть как минимум 4 базы, чтобы понять как именно все здесь работает. Потом немного развиться и опять все запороть.
Проиграть в этой игре очень просто. У вас всегда куча проблем. 
Если вы думаете, что назначив человека или курицу, или еще кого-нибудь на должность охранника - это не значит, что он не станет убегать в панике от злобных пиратов, которые ворвались к вам на станцию и расстреливают всех (да-да еще одна запоротая база)...
А может у вас пол экипажа свихнулись и устраивают драки? Все хорошо, пока они не попадут в отсек жизнеобеспечения и не разломают там все к чертям (да, еще один рестар)
Не смотря на то, что играть еще только в альфе, она уже генерит кучу забавных историй и не заставляет вас скучать.
Также хочется отметить хорошее чувство юмора у авторов (ну естественно это же Double Fine) и приятную графику в игре.
Буду с ждать полную версию игры. 
Считаю, что игра полностью стоит своих денег!
Кстати, если вам вдруг показалось, что игра banished сложная, то эта игра вам покажется полным хардкором ;-)","If you remember and love the game Evil Genius, you'll love this one!
The principle is simple. Build your space base, populate it with creatures, assign them to specific positions, and keep them all alive and entertained. Sounds simple. In reality, you need to screw up at least four bases to understand how everything works. Then, develop a bit, and screw everything up again.
It's very easy to lose in this game. You always have a ton of problems.
Just because you think assigning a human, or a chicken, or anyone else to a security position doesn't mean they won't run in panic from the evil pirates who've broken into your station and are shooting everyone (yes, another screwed up base)...
Or maybe half your crew has gone crazy and are starting fights? Everything's fine until they get into the life support module and wreck everything (yes, another reboot).
Even though it's still in alpha, it's already generating tons of funny stories and never lets you get bored.
I'd also like to point out the developers' good sense of humor (it's Double Fine, of course) and the game's pleasing graphics.
I'm looking forward to the full version.

They claim they're going to fix bugs, but as I made clear in the review below, they couldn't even finish the A.I. during thier ""Alpha"" stage.

This game is like an incredibly dumbed-down Dwarf Fortress in space. Key word being dumb. 

The AI has incredibly complex inabilities to solve their problems. They would rather let themselves asphyxiate in the cold of space than finish constructing the airlock that is filled with oxygen. Why? Because the unfinished part is a space suit locker. They were in space suits already.

In a previous run, the builders refused to add onto the life support section because oxygen was running low (for some unknown reason) and so the whole crew suffocated. 

Another run, I had to tear down a door I placed. That destroyed the wall and converted the next room from an airlock into a reactor, and while trying to fix that, the builder simply never finished construction. The crew died because they had no airlock to exit and expand and there was a hole into space.

The security have no sense of uniformity and would rather walk one at a time into a derelict and die continuously to the same thing.

You can't place objects in 4 directions, only two. I don't know why 4-view camera controls aren't implemented yet, but its frustrating to deal with as you have so much unused space. 

It's a neat concept and can become a good game, but it is not at all worth your time or money. It is bug-ridden. It has very stupid AI.

And now, ALMOST A YEAR HAS PASSED...
During this time, only six minor updates have been released. The gameplay hasn't been updated at all. There's basically nothing to do in the game :(

I don't recommend it yet, I have a feeling it'll be abandoned :(

PS: Play the magnificent RimWorld instead – the progress is obvious, and it's already fun to play, even though it's still alpha 6.

PS: They've finally abandoned the game, announced version 1.0, followed by a modding toolkit, and off we go... Oh, DoubleFine, that's not good... And at the very beginning, they promised to at least add a third z-dimension to the beta..."

However, this game: Spacebase DF-9 is not a good game. Why? Several reasons, but most relate to really bad controls. To build stuff or select or anything is really fiddily because it has a hard time registrating where the mouse is pointing on the grid - so you have a really hard game just controlling the damn game. Also the UI is hard to understand sometimes. The citizens all have their own individual ""twitter feeds"" where they write what the think of your space station, but the problem is that it's hard to understand exactly what their problems are. The game is also very unbalanced so it's hard to get a space base running and the nature of space means that it's important to make sure that you build correctly the first time. More so than in dwarf fortress where you can occasionally correct mistakes or convert rooms. Here your items often take more than 1 space on a grid so you'll find that its harder to convert rooms to other things. Also the rooms needs to be substantially bigger and you cannot put stuff like beds beside walls because they need all of the bed's adjacent squares to be free.

EDIT: It has been a long time since the developers decided to abandon this project. I think I speak for all of us who bought this game when I say that we're all deeply disappointed in them. We all think it's a scam, and that it was not finished like it should have been. They never fixed the interface or the controlling problems. Stay away from this scam if  you  know what's good for you.","First let me say this: I have a very deep love for Dwarf Fortress.

Alles an negativen Kritikpunkten kann schon wenige tage nach veröffentlichen der Kritik hinfällig sein. Bedenkt das also.

Nun zum spiel. Es ist ein bissel wie Dungen keeper mit dem ganzen räume bauen. Es hat viel potenzial und ich finde bisher es war kein fehlkauf. Natürlich gibt es nach einen update wie aktuell mit version 6 viele probleme. vieles muss eingestellt werden und ausbalanciert werden. aber die Entwickler sind dran und arbeiten sichtbar dran. Also nicht gleich aufregen wenn nach einen updatet mal alles mist ist. Einfach einige tage warten und das meiste gibt sich schon.

Of course, there are a lot of problems after an update like the current one with version 6. A lot of things need to be adjusted and balanced. But the developers are working on it and are clearly working on it. So don't get upset if everything is crap after an update. Just wait a few days, and most things will improve.

Personally, I don't see that I wasted money on a bad game."
12012174,german,2014.08.07 16:10,❌,✅,0.5,0,"Die Idee des Spiels ist super, aber die Umsetzung...wo fängt man da nur an.
Ich möchte gar nichts über die Grafik, Musik, Soundeffekte oder die Steuerrung schreiben, denn alle diese Punkte sind ganz gut umgesetzt. Das Problem ist die Spielmechanik! 

Ein paar Beispiele (aus der getesteten Alpha 6c - Version):

* Für die Sauerstoffproduktion muss man Sauerstoffaufbereitungsanlagen bauen. Pro drei Bewohner eine. Diese gehen mit der Zeit kaputt (alles geht viel zu schnell kaputt) oder werden von den Eindringlingen beschädigt und müssen von Technikern repariert werden. Die machen aber praktisch nie etwas, sind immer sauer, depressiv, traurig oder reden und essen den ganzen Tag. Kommt es dazu, dass der Sauerstoffpegel unter 50 % sinkt, laufen die Bewohner der Station hysterisch herum bis sie am Sauerstoffmangel sterben. Auch die Techniker. Keiner kommt auf die Idee eine Anlage zu reparieren. Zudem sterben sie alle gleichzeitig. Spielende.

* Eine Speicherfunktion gibt es nicht bzw. sie funktioniert nicht. 

* Angreifen sind überstark. Zwei Angreifer können 20 Bewohner und damit die ganze Basis (3 Stunden Spielzeit) in 2 Minuten auslöschen. Das Problem ist, dass die Bewohner dumm sind und einfach panisch durch die Gegend laufen und sich nacheinander abknallen lassen. 

* Eine monstermäßige Kanone mit drei Läufen als Verteidigunsanlage kann keinen Angreifer oder verrückt gewordenen Bewohner stoppen. Die Kanonen gehen nach ein paar Treffern oder Schlägen kaputt. 

* Einige Bewohner infizieren sich mit Krankheiten und können sich in Monster verwandeln, die alles zerstören. Das gleiche wie mit Anfreifern - kaum zu töten. 

* Alle paar Minuten gibt es ein Meteoriteneinschlag auf der Station. Mehrere Räume fangen Feuer oder der Boden wird zerstört. Die meisten Bewohner laufen panisch umher, einige greifen aber zum Glück zum Feuerlöscher. Oft bleiben sie dann aber irgendwie stehen und sterben trotzdem.

* Das Gefängnis funktioniert überhaupt nicht. Das Sicherheitspersonal macht nichts, außer essen, reden und schlafen. Verrückt gewordene Einwohner laufen in Ruhe um zerstören die Einrichtung oder sie werden von anderen Bewohnern getötet. 

* Allgemein macht auf der Basis kaum jemand etwas. Geregelte Arbeitsläufe sind nicht zu erkennen. 

Das waren nur ein paar Punkte, die mir schnell eingefallen sind. Man könnte diese Liste noch mindestens doppelt so lang machen. Würde das Spiel 5€ kosten, könnte man das ganze noch verkraften, denn das Spielprinzip ist echt fesseld. 

Meine Empfehlung für alle Leute, die überlegen sich dieses Spiel zu kaufen: Wartet auf eine spielbare Version und spielt in der Zwischenzeit Startopia! Gibt es auf Steam für 5,99 €. DF-9 ist bis jetzt in weiten Teilen nur ein schlechter Klon von Startopia.

Sollten die Entwickler sich mehr antrengen und doch ein spielbares Spiel abliefern, werde ich meine Bewertung natürlich ändern.","The idea of ​​the game is great, but the execution...where do you even begin?
I don't want to write anything about the graphics, music, sound effects, or controls, because all of these aspects are implemented quite well. The problem is the game mechanics!

A few examples (from the tested Alpha 6c version):

* To produce oxygen, you have to build oxygen processing plants. One for every three residents. These break down over time (everything breaks down far too quickly) or are damaged by the invaders and have to be repaired by technicians. However, they practically never do anything; they're always angry, depressed, sad, or talk and eat all day. If the oxygen level drops below 50%, the station's residents run around hysterically until they die from lack of oxygen. The technicians too. Nobody thinks of repairing a plant. Moreover, they all die at the same time. The game is over.

* There is no save function, or it doesn't work.

* Attacks are extremely powerful. Two attackers can wipe out 20 residents, and thus the entire base (3 hours of gameplay), in 2 minutes. The problem is that the residents are stupid and just run around in a panic, getting shot one after the other.

* A monstrous three-barreled cannon used as a defense system can't stop an attacker or a resident who has gone mad. The cannons break after a few hits or blows.

* Some residents become infected with diseases and can transform into monsters that destroy everything. The same as with attackers - almost impossible to kill.

* Every few minutes, a meteorite strikes the station. Several rooms catch fire or the floor is destroyed. Most residents run around in a panic, but luckily some grab the fire extinguisher. Often, however, they somehow stop and die anyway.

* The prison doesn't function at all. The security personnel do nothing except eat, talk, and sleep. Residents who have gone mad wander around quietly, destroying the facility, or they are killed by other residents.

* In general, hardly anyone is doing anything on the base. There are no discernible regulated workflows.

Those were just a few points that quickly occurred to me. This list could be at least twice as long. If the game cost €5, it would still be bearable, because the gameplay is truly captivating.

My recommendation for anyone considering buying this game: Wait for a playable version and play Startopia in the meantime! It's available on Steam for €5.99. DF-9 is largely just a poor clone of Startopia so far.

If the developers put more effort into it and deliver a playable game, I will of course revise my rating."

Lo unico malo que le veo es que tiene poco contenido pero eso
se irá arreglando con el tiempo.
Lo que me sorprende es que aunque sea early acces no tenga bugs.

This game has been classified as hazardous space debris.  Set your navicomps to avoid this sector at all costs, lest you find yourself wasting space credits.

UPDATE: Developer has released the game as ""done.""  Oh, but we'll get the source code so we can finish it ourselves, right?  Right??  Well, let me say this:  Tim Schafer is the new Peter Molyneux.  *drops mic and walks away from Double Fine forever*

UPDATE 2:  Just played 1.05, the ""release"" version of the game.  Some of the bugs I've mentioned have been addressed, but only a few.  Now features a ""tutorial"" level that is basically just a pre-built base with some lame text overlays telling you to perform a few tasks.  I played the level after the tutorials were complete, and was immediately swamped by a continous stream of raider vessels.  Base went from 12 occupants to just 1, and when I saw that last ""Raider breach vessel incoming!"" message I just quit the game and un-installed it again.

Pros:

☑  Er.  I wish it were a good game that had potential?  Cuz I would love me a Sim Starbase game.

Cons:

☒  Very buggy user interface.  I commonly had to ""trick"" the game to build an item by building another and then canceling it before completing it in order to get it to build the second item (which is the item I wanted in the first place).  If items overlap, then it is impossible to click on one or more of the overlapped items.  (Say if you have a claim-territory flag that is overlapped by an oxygen generator.)

☒  Obtuse needs and wants system.  My crew fights and kills each other, and I am never sure why without carefully inspecting each cluttered needs/wants screen for each crew member.

☒  I've lost dozens of crew without even really knowing why.  The notification bar fills up with tons of ""XXXX needs medical attention"" and ""XXXX is dead"" messages before I can even react to whatever is putting my crew in danger.

☒  Your first base is going to result in dead astronauts.  So will your second, third, fourth and likely fifth.  Margins are extremely thin at the beginning of the game, so if you screw up in the least (such as build a room too small to hold a refinery, without knowing how big that refinery is) you have to start over.  There is no way to undo or fix a build mistake, so if you make any at the critical first few minutes of the game, then kiss your space-butt goodbye.

☒  Zoning system is clunky and requires you to build a special-purpose room to simply place one item.

☒  Annoying fixed view that cannot be rotated, nor is there a ""fade behind"" effect when someone or something is behind another object, so it's easy to lose people or things.  This will likely never change either, because while the crew are rendered as 3D models, it's clear the walls and objects are static sprites, and if the devs didn't account for rotating views at this point in the dev cycle, they probably never will.

☒  Overall quite buggy.  UI elements end up becoming corrupt, crew get stuck in rampaging loops and can never be subdued, miners will drop ore in the middle of space during a crisis and never pick it back up, etc.

☒  Feels very unpolished, and like an early WIP.  Expected more progress for this game since the last time I looked at it (about a year ago).","☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰☰

11996265,english,2014.08.06 11:52,❌,✅,0.5145630836,3,"I used to like this game. Post version 6 release, it now totally sucks.

Why?
Specifically the AI doesn't seem capable of managing the new functionality. Also the threat system is totally broken. For some reason in my ""extreme low"" hostility sector I get constant pirate raids (and I do mean constant. Like... 30 seconds after beating the last one there's another).  Or a meteor impact. The ""game"" (if one can call it that anymore) has gone from a space colony sim to a constant crisis. 

But more fundamentally... the brig system doesn't work right, nor the tantrum system. So first the brig system: enemies can often get ""subdued"" where they just stand there endlessly until they starve. If you have a brig, you can store them there instead. There doesn't appear to be any reason to do this that I can see. There is no benefit. Its preferable to let enemies starve, especially because sometimes captured enemies lose their ""subdued"" flag and simply walk out of the brig to shoot up your base again. Seriously... WHAT IS THE POINT? Also... did you guys even test this release?? Its almost entirely unplayable.

Okay so now to the tantrum system. Colonists can get freaked out, wreck the place up, and fight with fellow colonists. Yet for some reason this happens to happy colonists sometimes. I suppose one could say they ""just snap"" or something but... once again, what is the point of happiness if it doesn't do anything? Bigger problem is after a tantrumed colonist is subdued they lay there and nothing happens. Even if you have doctors on staff, they don't seem to treat the person like... laying there in the hallway injured. It appears that the primary role of doctors is simply corpse disposal, rather than anything doctor-y.

If steam had a numeric rating system, I'd give this 1 of 5 stars. Its really abysmal and should never have been released with the numerous game-breaking bugs. At least it was playable before.","I used to like this game. Post version 6 release, it now totally sucks.

Story is non-existent it relies on your attachment to your base inhabitants which at this moment is little to none but the game is constantly being updated, new AI and character interactions are making your inhabitants a little bit more entertaining or quirky and eventually you wouldn't be able to live without 'randomly generated name' for fear they maybe sucked out into the coldness of space. Random encounters become more of a tedious burden after the many hours I have played this game however more and more events, new interactions, content, game dynamics are constantly being updated and worked on, to keep me coming back each time to test out all the new content.

Conclusion is I loved games like Theme Hospital, Space Colony, Startopia and I love this game! There is enough to work with to classify it as a functioning game now and it constantly gets better. It has incredible potential and I can see the vision the Dev has in mind, its very bright.

I recommend this game because I believe in Double Fine and really want it to work out. I played the super early super basic demo a long time ago and it's came a long way from that, but still has a lot to go. At this point in early access, you're paying to help support the game's creation as well as beta testing it. There's a lot that needs work, but you can see where it's going.

Some very weird things that happened:
-A room got hit with a meteor, caught on fire, and they would just kind of use the room normally. I thought ok, I'll put a fire extinguisher in there. The guy walks into the fire, builds the extinguisher, walks out, room stayed ablaze until I quit for the night. They would seriously walk in, use the console to research something, and walk out. Hilarious, but buggy.
-Ships would dock with mine, then nothing would happen. Nobody would come from the ship, nobody would go into the ship. Nothing. One time one of my people had a panic attack and ran into all the rooms of the docked ship that allowed me to claim them, but there was nothing in there. 
-I had to rezone the Brig to something else so prisoners would maybe leave there and get food instead of starving to death. 
-I had an incapacitated invader just kind of chill out in my main room doing nothing. I eventually forced the cop to put him in the brig where he slowly converted to being a member of society, but couldn't figure out how to unbrig him so he also slowly starved to death. Added food processor in the brig, they kind of just decided death was better, and died. 

I mean really? Those are bugs, but they're also pretty hilarious.

2mal ein Early Access... SpaceBase DF-9 (Wertung:Ungenügend) und Prison Archtect (gut mit tendens zu sehr gut)

Spiel von Double Fine nocheinmal? 
NEIN nie wieder...","Warning!

I think this game has potential, which is exactly why I got into it.
Unfortunately, there's almost no development, and at this stage, the game is nothing more than a nice idea...

Now this unfinished ""garbage"" is being dumped on the market as a final release...
For my part, when I look at Double Fine's roadmap, I feel absolutely BETRAYED!

Twice in Early Access... SpaceBase DF-9 (Rating: Unsatisfactory) and Prison Architect (good, leaning towards very good)

Play Double Fine again?
NO, never again..."

The way the power usage on base works is unblanced, hostiles can plow through your whole base in nothing flat, the illnesses are unblanced; frankly everything is unblanced. For a supposedly finished game it is terrible. Don't waste your money.


EDIT: (9/23/14) Don't buy it. Just don't waste your money on it. The bugs are still there and pathfinding is still horrible, possibly worse than ever. I can't play more than 30 mins before I rage quit over some stupid bug that is seemingly never going to be fixed.

I was very hopeful when I reviewed originally, but with the annoucement the game is leaving Early Access still as broken as it currently stands is extremely dissapointing. I will not be buying from this developer in Early Access ever again.

Original (8/23/14):

Each update it gets better, but it has some bad bugs in it. I play on Mac and for me the most annoying bug is that the door images are never doors sometimes they blink between a chickenhead in the shape of the door that should be there and nothing at all. 

In this game you run a spacebase that's constantly falling apart around your ears. If the workers aren't killing themselves the raiders will do it for them.

Currently you can only play one game at a time. If you start over you lose the base you were building. You usually lose the base to something stupid before you get to the point you would want to start over anyway.

Everything needs worked on. AI, pathfinding, how the spacewalkers handle their oxygen timelimits (they ignore them and die last I played), how often metors strike, how the bartender wants to eat which jams up everybody as they wait on the bartender to be served who can't serve himself (only fix I know is to change the bartender's job to nothing which unsticks everyone and then change him back until the next time), how the builders decide what to build next, just everything.

The game looks promising and when it decides not to kill me within the first 15 mins of gameplay I usually can have fun until the door images being wrong get to me or raiders invade while the turrents do nothing and I get mad. I open it after an update, start a new base, play until I rage quit, and wait for the next update to try again.

My suggestion is to put it on your wishlist and check it early next year. See if the bugs have been fixed and even then only buy on sale.","EDIT: (12/24/14) This game still has very annoying bugs.

Leider hat Double Fine beschlossen von der Alpha 6 direkt zum Full-Release überzugehen. Seit der Alpha 5e wurden noch ein paar Bugs gefixed und ein paar Ergänzungen gemacht, für einen Full-Release ist es jedoch noch viel zu früh. Ein paar Stunden Spielspaß bleiben garantiert, mehr aber nicht. Angebracht ist also der deutliche Hinweis, dass in Punkto Potential, Spieltiefe und Features vieles vieles unentwickelt bleibt. Hunderte angedachte Features wurden vor dem Full-Release gestrichen und das Spiel durch die Veröffentlichung des Quellcodes in die Hände der Community gelegt. Künftige Community-Mods werden die vielen Lücken, die die Entwickler hinterlassen, vermutlich nicht auffangen. 

Double Fine hat dem Ruf der Early-Access Spiele hiermit keinen Gefallen getan. Schade um die 23 Euro die in der Hoffnung auf ein ""großes"" Spiel investiert wurden. Viele Spieler dürften sich zurecht ""abgezockt"" vorkommen. Ich werde diese Spiele-Schmiede künftig meiden!","[b]If you're interested in Spacebase DF-9, it's best to wait until the game is significantly discounted.[/b]
Unfortunately, Double Fine has decided to go straight from Alpha 6 to the full release. Since Alpha 5e, a few bugs have been fixed and a few additions made, but it's still far too early for a full release. A few hours of gameplay are guaranteed, but nothing more. It's therefore appropriate to clearly point out that much remains undeveloped in terms of potential, depth, and features. Hundreds of planned features were removed before the full release, and the game was placed in the hands of the community with the release of the source code. Future community mods will likely not fill in the many gaps left by the developers.

Double Fine hasn't done the reputation of Early Access games any favors with this. It's a shame about the €23 invested in the hope of a ""big"" game. Many players may rightly feel ripped off. I will avoid this game developer in the future!"

Using your starting materials, you must build a makeshift shelter in space (not on a planet, mind you, I'm talking about outer space, the void, the nothingness).

A pressurization compartment, doors, an oxygenation room, a food dispenser, and an indoor or outdoor walkway to house an ore processing machine.

Once that's done, you'll have to:

- mine
- build bigger
- check your oxygen
- survive pirate attacks
- welcome other survivors
- choose each one's specialty (among miner, scientist, engineer, doctor, bartender (cook), guard, etc.)

Your creativity will be put to the test... and your patience will be tested!

I loved playing this game (check out some screenshots).

You have to build airtight rooms, produce oxygen, defend your base against unscrupulous pirates, get rid of the parasites that unfortunately came along with your colonists, whom you saved from a stranded ship. Passing stellar debris can set your base on fire, or breach your beautiful station...

Game entirely in English, forum in English.

!!! Warning: no further development planned!!!

Graphics: 15/20
Music: 15/20

Gameplay: Tough at first, hard to put down afterward <3

I would recommend it if you don't blame the developers for abandoning the game...

I'm sad... but it's still a good little game (try it).

The game promised a lot but was short from delivering even the bare miniums. Modding options were released but I think it was too late. The game is now most likely dead. Keep searching, there are other options for fans of base building and space.

Original review:

Many good things and many promises, it just needs time to grow. It is playable and enjoyable already, but if you get it consider it an investment for something that will surely be much better and polished. I have great faith in Double Fine's uniqueness to tackle their games though for now what you see mostly are the mechanics and some glimpses of geniality.

Nicht zu letzt  wird man immer wieder  heim gesucht von überfällen von Piraten!
Was  auch mal sehr heftig sein kann. Kaum denkt man  wow  endlich  läuft die Station.
Schon kommen Piraten, wenn mann nicht auf passt  metzeln  die Piraten  alle  deiner Bewohner nieder  und man  kann nur hoffen das  neue Bewohner  nach einer zeit  auf tauchen. ^^ 

Hier bei   muss man  dann selber  entscheiden  kann man die kurve kriegen oder   sollte man Lieber gleich neu Starten.
Die über fälle sind am Anfang noch  leicht werden aber zum Spiel verlauf schwere.

Es gibt auch  Erkundungs Phasen.
Plötzlich Taucht  nicht weit von  euer Station eine ander  auf  oder dockt wohl möglich an eure an.
Hier bei kommt schon  eine gewisse endecker laune  auf was wohl auf der anderen Station ist  sind es Feinde  oder neue Crew Mitglieder?

Wo ich mir schwer tat  war der Abbau an Rostoffen. Am Anfang war  noch recht viel  in der nähe der Station.
Wenn man diese  dann aba Abgebaut hatte. Sind meine jungs  ab zum den nexten  Felden. Problem ist  die Luft in den Raum anzügen. Wenn ihr nicht auf pass ! Fliegen sie zwar hin  aber kommen nie wieder zurück  und liegen,
 erst bewusst los und dann sogar Tot an der Abbaustelle. =)

Fatzit:

Mir hatt es sehr gefallen das man eine Station  bauen kann wie man möchte und  es wird nicht lang weilig .
Wo ich dazu sagen muss . Wäre schön wenn bald noch mehr Möglickeiten eingefürt  werden. denn wenn man alles  erforscht hat und auch alle Module mal durch gebaut  wurden. Kommt das spiel nur noch halb wegs  rüber.
Mir fehlt dann  das ich zu wenig machen kann. 
Es bleibt dann nur auf seine Bewohner auf passen und piraten Abwehren.

Ich finde wenn man noch mehr  optionen  des Stations ausbau mehr Möglichkeiten mit ein Bringt wie  dekoriere ich usw 
wird das spiel  noch intensiver. 

paar Evtl Quest. ^^
Händler besuch  zum kauf und verkauf .
Weltraum artefakte usw 
Eine Bio Modul wo man  Park Landschaften erstellen kann. (Mit Jahres wechsel: Sommer, Winter ,Frühling, Herrbst )
Für die Bewohner ein Shop wo  man sie  ein kleidern kann  vlt  ein enditor 
Waffen Shop um seine  Sicherheits kräfte auch  schwarz markt waffen  zukaufen.
und und und 

Da es aber noch nicht Fertig ist. finde ich den preis zu hoch  gesetzt,
denn man bezahlen muss.  Für ein Spiel das nicht Fertig ist  zu Teuer. 
Muss man so  sagen. 

Ansonsten hatte ich  viel Spaß und wurde auch Spielerisch  kurz weiße  gefanngen bis zu dem punkt wo ich alles erfoscht habe und  das man zu wenig Abbaufelder hatte. 

Am Ende  alles Erforscht und alles Abgebaut.  Die einzige geld einnahme Quele war ich  sammelte die Leichen  der Toten Piraten  und  hab sie zu geld gemacht, ist aber lang wierig usw .

Es ist ein gutes spiel  sollte aber  noch mehr  Möglichkeiten  bieten  denn so ist  es nur ein kurzes vergnügen von sagen wir ma 2 bis  8 Sdt . 

Ein spiel  für zwischen durch halt. 

Danke  schön""

Mfg Cap.","It's difficult at first. But once you get the hang of it and you've gotten used to the menu controls, which are a bit cumbersome here and there, it's a very exciting experience that demands a lot of planning, etc. the further you go.

Last but not least, you're constantly being attacked by pirates!
Which can be quite intense at times. You barely think, wow, the station is finally up and running.
Pirates are already coming. If you're not careful, they'll slaughter all your residents, and you can only hope that new residents will appear after a while. ^^

Here you have to decide for yourself whether you can get the hang of it or whether you should just start over.
The attacks are easy at the beginning but become more difficult as the game progresses.

There are also exploration phases.
Suddenly, another station appears not far from yours, or perhaps docks next to yours. This really puts you in a certain mood of discovery. I wonder what's on the other station—are they enemies or new crew members?

What I struggled with was mining raw materials. At the beginning, there was quite a lot near the station.
Once they were mined, my guys went off to the nearest fields. The problem is the air in the spacesuits. If you're not careful! They fly there but never come back and end up,
first deliberately leaving and then even dead at the mining site. =)

Summary:

I really liked that you can build a station however you want and it doesn't get boring.
I have to say, it would be nice if more options were introduced soon. Because once you've researched everything and built all the modules, the game only feels half-baked.
I miss the fact that I can't do much.
All you have to do then is watch out for your residents and fend off pirates.

I think if you add more options for station expansion, like decorating, etc., the game will become even more intense.

A few possible quests. ^^
Visiting merchants to buy and sell.
Space artifacts, etc.
A bio module where you can create park landscapes. (With a change of season: summer, winter, spring, autumn)
A shop for the residents where you can dress them, maybe an editor.
A weapons shop so your security forces can also buy black market weapons.
And so on.

But since it's not finished yet, I think the price is too high,
because you have to pay. Too expensive for a game that isn't finished.

You have to say that.

Otherwise, I had a lot of fun and even got briefly caught white until I reached the point where I had researched everything and there weren't enough mining fields.

In the end, everything was researched and everything was mined. The only source of income was collecting the bodies of dead pirates and turning them into money, but it's a long process, etc.

It's a good game, but it should offer more options. As it is, it's only a short-term pleasure of, say, 2 to 8 cities.

A game for in between.

Thank you.""

I'm offering up a cautious recommendation here. This game is very promising, while still being far from a complete experience in its current state (Alpha 5d). I bought it on the strength of it being made by Double Fine, who I think have a habit of putting out some really fun games. The recommendation is partially based on their reputation.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the UI is great and the overall aesthetic brings to mind 70s/ 80s SF such as Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy or Dark Star. Having said that, the devs should really set about implementing some goal-based gameplay soon enough. It seems an odd move to put it out in its current state since there's not the level of freedom for it to act simply as a light space survival sim. There isn't really enough depth at the moment for the player to come up with their own objectives beyond not dying for long enough to build a space-pub.

Knowning this game is early access, I bought it back in January expecting that it would have bugs, lack of content and be a work in progress. I also expected steady progression on the games development. In half a year of owning it I have seen two full alpha revisions and maybe seven or so minor patch/bug fix updates. There is no posted schedule or hint at when updates can be expected. It feels like this game is on the back burner and a one man team is working on it. All the while the rest of company is putting time and effort into they 5-6 other games listed for release this year from DoubleFine. In short, if you are looking for a game with a set alpha release time frame and/or constant status updates this is not for you.

This, is exactly why. You cannot properly review an Early Access game, since most of the games content is not present. It is like Minecraft in Alpha, its a proof of concept with not much context, polish or content.

And thats why, i cannot write a review about it...

What ? Dont look at me like that, when you think about it properly. You'l see exactly what i mean, it would be like reviewing something just based on its trailer. [spoiler] *Cough* Colonial Marines [/spoiler].

But allright... 

Spacebase DF-9 is a game, where you try to build a working Deep Space outpost. 

This is only hampered by the AI and its questionable prioritisation. Multiple times, my only technician thought it would be more important to talk to Johny the SpaceSlug than to, lets say, repair the Life Support systems.

And this is one of those games where there is a certain build plan. And deviating from it will just result in failure.
That is, if you can get the builders to do everything in time.

And speaking of ""doing stuff on time"". That is an ironic statement/joke, that i hope several of you will get. The citizen of your station are complete and utter lazybones.. 'ses.

Most of their life consist of eating food and talking to others. And this they will do even if they have other, more important stuff they need to do. Like maintenance to make sure the station wont disintegrate like a clown car.  Another rather ironic thing to say about this...


So to compress that all:

Spacebase DF-9  is like Minecraft in Alpha, very lacking in content. But the concept is easy to get, now it just needs some care and attention to make it a full game. And for gods sake, repair the AI.","What can be said ?...: Spacebase DF-9.

Unfortunately, the alpha (as of July 2, 2014) is far too small in scope. After about two hours, the game is completely grasped and offers no more surprises.

4. Random Debris fields are not really a challenge.  Add a couple of fire extenguishers and you can over come them.  
5. Infirmary is useless.  Needs a serious look to make it a worth while room
6. add action menus to the right click of a resident.  example:  Right Click > take corpse to refinery/dispose etc. 

I am anxious to see what this game can become. You are on the right track!"

Прилетели рейдеры, турельки и секурити их перестреляли. 1 рейдер оказался ранен, валялся корчился от боли. Пришел доктор и вылечил его! Рейдер встал и убил доктора, а потом еще и все оборудование в комнате переломал. Прибежал техник чинить, рейдер и его угандошил.
Вот еще одна ситуация. Начал строить базу, 3 рабочих, построил штуку для производства воздуха. Прилетели еще 2 чувака, а штука расчитана на троих.

The most frustrating thing is when you have 10 guys in your base, each with their own skill level up to 5, and then two raiders show up and shoot down two-thirds of the staff. There's no tutorial; I ruined five bases before I learned how to control everything.

Regarding intelligence:
Raiders arrived, turrets and security shot them down. One raider was wounded, lying on the ground writhing in pain. A doctor came and healed him! The raider got up and killed the doctor, and then broke all the equipment in the room. A technician came running to fix it, and the raider killed him.
Here's another situation. I started building a base with three workers, built an air production thing. Two more guys showed up, and the thing was designed for three. I ordered a second one to be built for air, but instead they ran around the base in a panic that they were running out of air, and they ran like that for about 3 minutes until they all died."

Unfortunately, it hasn't had a significant content upgrade since I initially saw it months ago on an Evening with Sips episode or short series.  What is in this game is a wide gamut of bugs combined with sheer stupidity when it comes to the AI, arguably the most important part of the game, and they screwed it up.

Not being able to build rooms, place objects, or cancel construction orders without having to move the camera around until the game sees fit to finally let your commands go through was the most common bug, and it persisted in being terrible from the moment I tried to start building a base to my eventual giving up on the game.  Random events seem to pull from a pool of maybe 5 different things, the most frequent of which was a ship encounter that featured a squeal along the lines of ""EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!! WE FINALLY FOUND YOU!!!!!!!!  WE'RE COMING ABOARD THIS INSTANT!"" to which no matter whether you select to allow them on or not, you are forced to take on additional crew members, all of which will be more of a liability than a help due to their universally crap skills.  This will culminate in your base having to constantly expand its oxygen suppliers and eventually even building a second reactor, just to provide for these new idiots while avoiding losing your valuable crew members to oxygen deprivation as the wastes of space use it all up.

Oh, and if you want to expand your oxygen room to make space for more recyclers, or any room in fact, make sure you set the entire station to become builders.  Because when you have four builders dismantle a wall, immediately head back into the base to go to sleep, and refuse to build the floor in place of the wall you just tore down, your entire base will asphyxiate and your builders will sleep themselves to death, dooming the entire station.  Absolute rubbish prioritizing and programming.

By GMCamulos

Genre: Simulation, Indie, Strategy
Platform: PC / Mac / Linux 
Publisher / Developer: Double Fine Productions

From the Devs:
“Spacebase DF-9 is a simulation game in ongoing development at Double Fine Productions. Alpha 3b version is available right now for Windows, Mac, and Linux.”

Gameplay:
So the first simulation strategy game I ever played was Theme Hospital, and I am SO glad that the basics have stayed the same.
Spacebase DF-9 still being in early access alpha stages at the moment means there are still some bugs that need fixing, but that is not to say that the game is not engaging and fun right now, because it very much is! 
From the get go you start where you want to. You pick the location to start from the galaxy map which has different indicators as to how that area will play. From how many minerals will be there for you to mine when you arrive, how close you are to warp gates for new visitors (good and bad) and even the areas magnetic field levels. 
Once you find an area you like the looks of, you travel to that area in your trusty SEED Capsule with your three starting inhabitants in your roster.

You start off with 6 minutes of air in their space suits so it’s a good idea to build your beginning base as quickly as possible.

From there the game progresses with new rooms to build onto your ship, the need for food and clean air. Refineries to turn your mined resources into useable material and the delight of new people arriving at your station and the pain of having raiders try to destroy your base.
The main issue I currently have with the alpha (which I assume will be fixed pretty soon) is that half the time I need something built quickly to stop bad things happening… my builders decide that they have other more important things to do (which has resulted in everyone on my base dying from starvation about four times now).
But if you have played any simulation game in the past, it’s a quick pickup to learn how the game mechanics work and no trouble from there on in.

Graphics:
For an early access Alpha release, the game clearly shows it has had some graphical polish sought early in development. 
The rich backgrounds and effects used in the game provide a very crisp and clean alpha. Not much variation once you start building, but you never know, the developers at Double Fine may add some randomisation when building rooms in a later release?

Sound:
The game does have a nice background track playing and there are some audio assets in the game, but nothing that really stood out or shocked me. I look forward to more sound assets being added in the future, but in alpha development that is not something you really wait with baited breath for.

Skill Levels and Controls:
As I stated at the start, I have been playing simulation games for a while now. And most gamers would be able to tell you the jist of what happens in The Sims. 
So its not hard to understand that the game runs pretty smoothly for most gamers. 
Each hotkey is listed on the action in your GUI menu for building and assignment of rosters, so no trouble there. Camera is a quick to grasp control setup as well. You basically zoom in and out and use the W,S,A,D keys to move around the map.
I think a veteran simulation player would have the best bet of survival in their first base run. But it is not 100% clear at first what is needed when and how much of something is a good idea to start with. 
So expect a bit of restarting as you work things out. Which leads to:

Replayability:
Like most simulation and strategy games, there is a metric tonne of replayability, even at this alpha stage. 
The maps are randomly generated when you start based on the map level indicators when you pick your base local from the galaxy map, BUT you get to choose where on the map you build your first room, and from that first room, the choice is all up to you how you want to build. 
The random encounters of new inhabitants and raiders also helps determine what to build next. 
But I dare say, no two bases will ever be the same!
At the moment though you can only have one base saved at a time. You start a base, then save and exit. If you start a new one and then save and exit it DOES overwrite the old base, so be careful.

Last thoughts:
I spent a bit during the last STEAM sales, but I am very very glad I picked up this little gem. It’s a fun take on space base simulation, and holds a lot of potential.
I will be keeping an eye out for future dev plans for this one and recommend that if you have the $24.99 then you should pick this one up for your library.

I must say, the fact that the devlopers ignored a lot of feedback of the Community is very true.

Even I tried to help out, finding bugs, bringing feedback how to make specific core mechanics more fun... but most of them got ignored.

Alpha 5 should have shown us, that it goes down:
Even the Healthsystem didn't work in the beginning!
The game has three parts connected to health, Injuries, Illnesses and ""HEALTHPOINTS"".

So Doctors were able to heal everything except the later, permanently injure personnel.
Another critical aspect were bodies which never got cleaned up.

After all: The new Sickbay went completely redundant due to the simple fact that firefights always ended up deadly. ""Phazer Rifles"" shoot several projectiles at one person and even in the case the intruders got killed, all those bolts hit the Character, killing them immediately.


The feeling of building a Spacebase with a social structure also failed massively.
Morale is a simple factor that drops and raises just because of silly things (How much nice ""Stuff"" is around a character... seriously?) and while the Death of your Crew also drops the morale, you can be sure they will always be depressed.

Content that makes the Spacestation feel more alive is fully missing, useless content got applied to the game as much as the developers could.

So brawls happen very often, incapacitating (yes, only here people get not killed) the other ones and in the end you are struggling to hold up with tons of angry, depressed people which get slowly killed by raiders.

The last update (that included a push from Double fine onto the Steam Mainpage), was probably the most frustrating. As stated above the brawls.
It also implemented Items, that get dropped by raiders and personnel, which in the end is rotting on the floor for eternity.
While some stuff sounds like weapons, some are armours, some are absolutely useless objects.

In the case of low morale, people go now insane, making them aggressive and destorying property... and get them brigged or killed in most cases.
While the brig was actually a nice Idea, it was the same like the medbay.

Double Fine's Devs or Conceptors didn't really think about the gameplay, they just kicked another Update out with features that are less then half working and this all under the cloak of Early Access.
While EACC-Games are indeed not finished and can have bugs, they gave us mostly core features that are buggy, imbalanced and never fixed them, going on with a silly routine until they canceled the Project.
While the Community always brought up Bugs, they automatically produced even the most obvious bugs without fixing it before a release.

In general: I am disappointed with Double Fine and their product. It is still very expensive (22€) on Steam and therefore I absolutely do not advice buying it unless you are ready for a buggy game that has barely potential for fun.

You would be better off looking to ancient games like Space Colony, or Startopia for a game of this genre that works.

But it is obvious to me that Double Fine isn't investing many resources in this game, and probably have no intention of doing so either.

My prediction? A halt in development by Fall of 2014 when the dev team gets recalled to work on what is seen as more 'profitable' ventures.

Each charecter in the game has their own little quirks as well, which certainly makes you feel a little more attatched to your charcters. You'll find yourself mourning the death of your favorite miner who got locked out of the base because of an airlock malfunction.

Sebbene sia ancora una versione alpha (allo stato attuale alpha 4d) ho trovato questo piccolo gioiello ipnotizzante.
Sono ancora presenti alcuni bug, alcuni grafici, altri di gameplay, ma il potenziale è enorme.
Consigliato ai fan del genere, della Doublefine e a tutti quelli che possono guardare oltre quallche piccolo bug di gioventù.
Sconsigliato a chi cerca un gameplay privo di bug o con poca pazienza. In tal caso meglio aspettare.
Giudizio comunque molto positivo.

AGGIORNAMENTO:
A seguito della decisione incomprensibile di DoubleFine di interrompere lo sviluppo del gioco, non posso che cambiare il giudizio della recensione. Rimangono validi i punti espressi precedentemente, ma pubblicare un gioco in stato di alpha (attualmente alpha 6e), aggiustando qualche bug e scartando tutte le feature che avrebbero potuto rendere il gioco un ottimo prodotto, a mio avviso è un colpo davvero basso nei confronti degli utenti che hanno pagato in anticipo, dando fiducia ad una software house del calibro di Double Fine. Questo può solo insegnare quanto segue: diffidate dai prodotti Early Access di software house blasonate. Le politiche interne prevalgono sempre sui desideri dell'utente finale. Meglio finanziare le produzioni Indie. Non vi è certezza nemmeno in quel caso che il prodotto venga completato, ma almeno lo sviluppatore ci mette la faccia.
Evitate pertanto di acquistarlo, se non ad un prezzo inferiore di €8. Una grossa delusione.","WARNING: PLEASE SCROLL DOWN FOR A CORRECTION FOLLOWING DOUBLE FINE'S DEVELOPMENT CEASE.

Although it's still an alpha version (currently a 4D alpha), I found this little gem mesmerizing.
There are still some bugs, some graphical, some gameplay-related, but the potential is enormous.
Recommended for fans of the genre, DoubleFine, and anyone who can look past a few minor early bugs.
Not recommended for those looking for bug-free gameplay or those with limited patience. In that case, it's best to wait.
Overall, a very positive review.

UPDATE:
Following DoubleFine's incomprehensible decision to cease development of the game, I can only change my review. The points made above remain valid, but releasing a game in alpha (currently alpha 6e), fixing a few bugs, and discarding all the features that could have made the game a great product, in my opinion, is a truly low blow to the users who paid in advance, placing their trust in a software house of Double Fine's caliber. This can only teach us the following: be wary of Early Access products from well-known software houses. Internal politics always prevail over the wishes of the end user. It's better to fund indie productions. Even then, there's no guarantee that the product will be completed, but at least the developer is putting their face forward.
Therefore, avoid purchasing it unless it's under €8. A huge disappointment."

This charming little strategy sim is easy to play, but does have its own pitfalls.
The first few times you play you'll most probably end up dead before you get the chance to do much, this is because if you don't follow the set pattern required to survive your poor little space men will suffocate and there is no warning about this, yet! (remember were still in early access here).

To start out ensure you get your room setup, airlock (which requires doors form object menu not the airlock menu?!)
and some oxygen generators and do this asasp as this is the only thing that can save you from dying before you begin.

Once your past that you can actually begin to play, your space men all have their own skills and personalities and require a variety of elements to keep them from going space crazy, but in addition to this issue you will have to deal with invaders, meteor storms and rogue stations that appear, so make sure to get some technicians, security and fire extinguishers.

The gameplay currently is pretty limiting but the constant influx of travellers does make it last as long as your willing to keep playing for, in a constant struggle to feed, water and generate oxygen to keep them all alive.

The graphics are a great deal better than the original alpha released in the amensia fornight 2012 but still is nothing head turning.

As far as value for money currently to play alpha I would say no but then theres a long road infront of the devs between now and final release, so lets hope it improves.

For now I think this is one to watch but don't buy until its much further down the road.

We provide an insight into the game and explain the first base building and the most important events.

Update: Unfortunately, a lot has changed for the worse since the early alpha review. The developers released the game too early and declared the unfinished game ""finished."" The enormous number of bugs simply makes it less fun to play. It's a real shame for the game's many loyal fans, as real potential was wasted here."

Seit Ende 2012 (Prototyp) in der Entwicklung, steckt das Spiel immer noch in einer Alpha-Phase, die man ihr auch ansieht, da immer noch einige elemenatare Funktionen nicht richtig funktionieren. Die Entwicklung läuft so schleppend, dass man den Eindruck gewinnt, die Entwickler ruhen sich auf den bereits eingesammelten Einnahmen und ihren Lorbeeren aus der Vergangenheit (hinter Double Fine Productions stecken immerhin so klangvolle Namen wie Tim Schafer etc.) aus. Schaut vielleicht nochmal in einem Jahr rein, vielleicht gibt es dann eine anständige Beta, die man präsentieren kann, denn wie schon erwähnt: es KÖNNTE ein richtig tolles Spiel werden. Aktuell werden jedoch höchstens Leute damit glücklich, die gerne Tester spielen. Spätestens nach einer gewissen Spielzeit/Größe der Raumbasis wird es unspielbar.

Bis dahin empfehle ich euch das grandiose und sehr ähnliche Spiel ""Space Colony HD"" von Firefly Studios und hoffe inständig, dass dieses Machwerk hier irgendwann eines Tages an diese Vorlage herankommt (oder gar übertrifft), dann gibt es auch wieder eine Empfehlung. :)","As much as I'm sorry about the potential behind the game, at this point, I can't recommend putting any more money into this development through crowdfunding (Early Access). In development since the end of 2012 (prototype), the game is still in an alpha phase, which is clearly evident, as some basic functions still don't work properly. Development is so slow that one gets the impression that the developers are resting on their laurels from the revenue they've already collected and their past laurels (after all, Double Fine Productions is backed by such renowned names as Tim Schafer, etc.). Maybe check back in a year; maybe there'll be a decent beta to present, because as I mentioned before: it COULD be a really great game. Currently, however, it's only going to be fun for people who enjoy playing testers. After a certain amount of play time/size of the space base, it becomes unplayable.

Until then, I recommend the terrific and very similar game ""Space Colony HD"" by Firefly Studios and sincerely hope that this creation will one day come close to (or even surpass) the original. Then I'll give it another recommendation. :)"

Ich mochte das was ich in der Alpha spielen durfte. Es hat mir sehr viel Spaß gemacht und ich habe mich super auf die weitere Entwicklung des Spieles gefreut.

Update:

I liked what I was able to play in the alpha. I had a lot of fun and was really looking forward to the game's further development. Now Double Fine has released this game unfinished, which is a huge disgrace, and right now Steam needs a money-back guarantee for fraudulent developers.... I actually really like Double Fine and their games... but this is simply unacceptable. 1. It damages Double Fine's reputation, 2. It's very unfair to the customer who trusts the developer....

Im Moment ist es noch nicht durchgängig Spielbar. Es sind sehr viele Detailfehler vorhanden, Optisch sowie in technischer Hinsicht.
Das schlimmste was mir Heute passiert ist, das ab einem Punkt das Spiel immer abgestürzt ist und ich komplett von vorne anfangen musste.
Gruselig finde ich die Menü-Tasten. Warum nicht einfach eine Menüleiste machen, wo die Hauptkategorien abgebildet sind. Darunter klappen dann die Untermenüs für die Objekte auf. Aber vieleicht wird das noch verbessert.
Die Wegfindung ist auch manchmal eher merkwürdig. Vorallem wenn die Ausserhalb gebaut wird, da fliegen die einfach durch die Wände.
Man kann auch nur auf einen Spielstand zurück greifen. Zwischenspeichern und evtl. wieder laden, wenn was schief geht ist nicht möglich.
Ja es muss noch sehr viel gemacht werden.
Aber ansonsten machte es mir wirklich Spass und hoffe auf mehr.

TIP: Wer ein vergleichbares Spiel sucht und mit weniger Fehlern kämpfen möchte, sollte sich Rimworld mal anschauen!","Caution! I recommend this game, but with the expectation that it will be expanded. Especially so that all the bugs are fixed.
At the moment, it's not fully playable. There are many minor errors, both visually and technically.
The worst thing that happened to me today was that the game kept crashing at one point, and I had to start all over again.
I find the menu buttons creepy. Why not just create a menu bar with the main categories? The submenus for the objects then open underneath. But maybe that will be improved.
The pathfinding is also rather strange at times. Especially when building outside, they just fly through the walls.
You can only access one save game. Saving and possibly reloading if something goes wrong isn't possible.
Yes, there's still a lot to be done.
But otherwise, I really enjoyed it and hope for more.

Basically you build a space station or as the name suggests a Spacebase. You do this by laying out rooms and zoning them for specific tasks. At first you'll need an airlock and a life support system so that your virtual Spacebase residents can breath. As you play, you'll discover that you need to expand, and that takes resources. You'll need to build more rooms and different types of zones to make your Spacebase function. Things like refineries, sleeping quarters and pubs. Yes, they have pubs in space.

As they get better at their tasks the station starts to hum along nicely.

Sometimes you can weasel your way out of sticky situations but eventually something is going to rain on your Spacebase. You'll need to prepare for that eventuality and defend your Spacebase if you want to hold onto it. 

This is an Early Access Game and it’s in Alpha 4b as of this writing. Even so, there is plenty of fun to be had with this game. Double Fine Productions, the developer, is actively releasing updates. They are shooting for updates on a monthly basis and that’s good.

9717963,brazilian,2014.03.04 02:32,❌,✅,0.5,0,"A premissa do jogo é bastante promissora, mas por enquanto ele está muito, mas muito cru mesmo. Definitivamente não vale a pena comprá-lo agora se você estiver atrás de diversão, salvo no caso se você estiver mais disposto a ajudar os desenvolvedores do que jogar mesmo. Isto porque não há praticamente nada a se fazer a não ser construir salas e mais salas repetidamente, com pouquíssimas opções, fazer pequenas explorações e agregar novos membros a sua tripulação.  

Para além da questão custo-benefício atual, o jogo tem uma mecânica que é bem irritante e que pode arruinar o jogo caso a IA não seja bem trabalhada: você não controla a tripulação! Esteje sempre com isso em mente ao ponderar a compra do jogo, não é um FTL com uma base espacial. A jogabilidade pressupõe que você enquadre os tripulantes em determinadas funções, e conforme você for construir algo ou fazer mineração de alguma eles vão obdecer de acordo com a própria IA. Se eles tiverem cansados, com fome ou tristes vão demorar para realizar as tarefas propostas. 

Por enquanto isso é catastrófico na questão da segurança da base, você não controla os seguranças nem a equipe de abordagem de outras estações que aparecem, a única coisa que você faz é selecionar um local para ser patrulhado. O que funciona muito, mas muito mal. É impossível, por exemplo, retirar os tripulantes de uma ameça que eles não possam enfretar, ou alguma base que fique despressurizada, vão morrer. Pelo menos por enquanto é catastrófico. 

Além disso há funções como técnico, bartender, botãnico e cientista (e segurança, praticamente) que você não tem o mínimo de controle sobre o que eles fazem, os equipamentos estarão lá e eles vão atuar conforme a IA. 

A princípio isso é interessante, é outro tipo de jogabilidade, mas por enquanto está funcionando mal, muito mal.","The game's premise is quite promising, but for now, it's very, very raw. It's definitely not worth buying right now if you're looking for fun, unless you're more interested in helping the developers than playing the game. This is because there's practically nothing to do other than build rooms and rooms repeatedly, with very few options, do some small exploration, and add new members to your crew.

Beyond the current cost-benefit issue, the game has a mechanic that's quite annoying and can ruin the game if the AI ​​isn't well-designed: you don't control the crew! Always keep this in mind when considering purchasing the game; it's not a space-based FTL. The gameplay assumes you assign crew members to specific roles, and as you build or mine something, they'll obey the AI's instructions. If they're tired, hungry, or sad, they'll take longer to complete the tasks.

For now, this is catastrophic for base security. You don't control the security guards or the boarding team of other stations that appear; the only thing you can do is select a location to patrol. This works very, very poorly. It's impossible, for example, to extract the crew from a threat they can't handle, or if a base depressurizes, they'll die. At least for now, it's catastrophic.

Furthermore, there are roles like technician, bartender, botanist, and scientist (and security, practically) where you have no control over their actions. The equipment is there, and they act according to the AI.

In principle, this is interesting; it's a different kind of gameplay, but for now, it's working poorly, very poorly."

Hallo, 
nun nach einigen Std. Spielzeit... man glaubt es kaum das es so extrem fesselt,
bleibt doch das ganze mit dem glibbrigen Beigeschmack der Alpha.

Frustrationsanfällige sollten definitiv noch die Finger davon lassen, 
da vielerorts noch extreme Bugs sind welche den Frustlevel in ungeahnte Höhen treiben kann ^^

Beispiele seien genannt:
In einer unachtsamen Minute kommt es plötzlich vor das die gesamte Crew
in der Bar sitzt und auf essen wartet das niemals kommt, weil die werten Barmännlein allesamt auch 
an einem Tisch stehen und auch auf essen warten :) 
Das Chaos perfekt zu machen Arbeiten die Mechaniker nicht (weil genau sie auf essen warten) und sämtliche Ausrüstung geht zu Schrott.. Luftfilter fallen aus ..Panik  und schlussendlich das finale Röcheln der Crew :(

Ebenso die Feuerbekämpfung gestaltet sich recht Frustrierend ... Feuerlöscher hängen zu hauf im Raum rum aber die Leute wollen die Feuer austreten...geraten dadurch in Brand und rennen wild ins nächste Feuer... tja der tot freut sich ^^

Auch die weg Findung der KI ist noch extrem anpassungswürdig... an Ecken passiert es bei den Luftschleusen des Öfteren das die leutchens durch die Wand glitchen und im unendlichen Vakuum enden ^^

Alles in allem ist das spiel absolut lustig und macht auch einen Heidenspaß solange die Bugs nicht einen auf den Boden zurück holen...

Ein paar Patch'e später könnte daraus durchaus ein witziges Game für zwischendurch werden.

Viel Spaß und vergesst nicht die Luft im All anzuhalten ;)","
Hello,
now after a few hours of playing... it's hard to believe it's so addictive,
but the whole thing still has that slimy aftertaste of the alpha.

Those prone to frustration should definitely stay away from it,
as there are still extreme bugs in many places that can drive frustration levels to unimaginable heights ^^

Examples:
In a moment of inattention, the entire crew suddenly finds themselves
sitting in the bar, waiting for food that never arrives, because the bartenders are all
standing at a table, also waiting for food :)
To complete the chaos, the mechanics don't work (because they're the ones waiting for food), and all the equipment goes to pieces... air filters fail... panic, and ultimately, the final gasp from the crew :(

Firefighting is also quite frustrating... fire extinguishers are hanging around in abundance in the room, but people want to put out the fires... they catch fire as a result, and run wildly into the next fire... well, death is happy ^^

The AI's pathfinding also needs a lot of fine-tuning... it happens at corners near the airlocks of the Often, people glitch through the wall and end up in an infinite vacuum ^^

All in all, the game is absolutely hilarious and a lot of fun as long as the bugs don't bring you back down to earth...

A few patches later, this could definitely become a fun game to play in between.

Have fun and don't forget to hold your breath in space ;)"

Slow dev, NO communication now, and after nearly a year and maybe 5 updates a complete waste of your time, money, and sanity.

This game will never ship - it'll just drag on at a third of the pace of any other game (with a pro studio, I might add) while the devs make excuses like some kid who lost their homework.

I'm done screwing around with this - Doublefine may be a good studio but this team is a bunch of slow, excuse making hacks who are in absolutely no rush to make this game (and I suspect the money for it is going to other projects.)

Don't buy this game, even on sale. It's not worth it - there are MANY better Dwarf Fortress style games out there who's devs are actually engaged in their craft/jobs. 

Doublefine screwed the pooch on this one, hard."

Quelques bugs néanmoins : des sols qui restent noir après création, petits glitchs graphiques, l'exploration des ""derelicts"" est assez foireuse (les soldats restent dans le sas et impossibilité de placer le ""Bacon"" où on voudrait dans celui ci, ou alors les soldats tournent autour de l'épave). Je précise que ces petits bugs mineurs n'empechent pas d'y jouer ;). Y'a du potentiel et même dans sa version actuel il est plaisant.

Some bugs though: floors that stay black after creation, small graphical glitches, the exploration of the ""derelicts"" is quite messed up (the soldiers stay in the airlock and it's impossible to place the ""Bacon"" where you want in it, or the soldiers turn around the wreck). I should point out that these minor bugs don't prevent you from playing it ;). There's potential and even in its current version it's enjoyable.

The game play is fun for a while, but the unpolished pathfinding and job queueing makes a decent obstacle to large bases.

In SpaceBase DF-9, there's no micro-managing. The A.I. take on a life of their own once you give them a task so it can get rather frustrating. And most of them are very, very moody, which affect their work ethic severely (ugh). They're fairly stupid at their current stage of development, so you can expect to lose a base very quickly - regardless of whether you're playing the game correctly or not. And if your base doesn't fall apart right away, it will eventually. It takes quite a while to understand how each A.I. functions (due to their personalities) and how to work around them. 

Even with all that said, it's a very fun game. I have fun, anyway. It helps that I enjoy simulator games. It's space sims! Sorta.

Ein paar Asteroiden schweben in unsrer Nähe... ihre Materie könnte sich später noch als nützlich erweisen.

Eine Raffinerie, sowie 3 Sauerstoffrecycler und ein Essensreplikator sind schon konstruiert. Als Nächstes planen wir ein Schlafzimmer, da der kalte Boden unserer Basis nichts im Vergleich zu einem echten Bett ist.

Spacedate 9158: Das Schlafzimmer steht. Endlich schlafen! Der Bordcomputer zeigt an, dass sich ein unbekanntes Flugobjekt nähert, aber das ist mir egal... ich will mich nur kurz ausruhen.

Spacedate 9159: Cheeseness und die anderen sind tot. Ich habe mich im Schlafzimmer versteckt und die Türen aus Panik abgebaut. Das Flugobjekt war das Schiff dreier Weltraumpiraten. Oh mein Gott... das wird mein Ende.

Spacedate 9160: Als die Piraten mit ihrem Raubzug fertig waren und sich in die Luftschläuse begeben hatten, habe ich diese sowie die Tür zu den Sauerstoffrecyclern geöffnet und sie ins All geblasen, noch bevor diese ihre Raumanzüge anziehen konnten. Cheeseness, das ist für dich. Mögest du in Frieden ruhen.

Außerdem haben sie ihre Freunde angerufen, um auch hier mitzumachen. Ich glaube, dieses Raumstation wird doch noch ein richtiges Zuhause.

Spacedate 9155: Cheeseness and the others are currently vaporizing nearby asteroids to acquire enough matter for further construction. A refinery, as well as three oxygen recyclers and a food replicator, have already been constructed. Next, we'll plan a bedroom, since the cold floor of our base is nothing compared to a real bed.

Spacedate 9158: The bedroom is finished. Finally, sleep! The onboard computer indicates that an unidentified flying object is approaching, but I don't care... I just want to rest for a bit.

Spacedate 9159: Cheeseness and the others are dead. I hid in the bedroom and dismantled the doors in a panic. The flying object was the ship of three space pirates. Oh my God... this will be the end of me.

Spacedate 9160: When the pirates finished their raid and went into the airlocks, I opened them and the door to the oxygen recyclers and blew them into space before they could put on their spacesuits. Cheeseness, this is for you. May you rest in peace.

Spacedate 9161: I'm lonely. The matter is running out, and I don't have time to get more because I have to take care of the engines. The onboard computer shows another approaching flying object. If they're pirates again, I'll probably join them. Better than starving here.

Spacedate 9164: The craft was a SEED! Just like the one we came here with. The occupants were very friendly and immediately wanted to join my base! They even called their friends to join us. I think this space station is going to be a real home after all.

Spacedate 9166: There are already 21 of us... Amazing. And the best part is: We even have our own bar! I can hardly believe my luck.

Spacedate 9167: An asteroid storm destroyed our bar and sucked seven crew members into space. The whole crew is mourning.

Spacedate 9169: Pirates successfully repelled.

Spacedate 9171: Things are looking up again. We've taken in a Terran named Sato, who seems to be a gifted scientist. He's currently researching pirate-proof doors.

Spacedate 9173: Sato is dead. Parasite infection. The parasite is currently running amok. Our security guard was murdered in his sleep, and the other crew members have no combat experience whatsoever. Everything's ruined. I'm sitting in the bedroom again, dismantling the doors. Maybe afterward I'll go into the airlocks and just let myself drift into space..."

The final version will definitely be great! But as I said, it's simply not worth the approximately €20 at the moment. There are definitely other DF games that are more worthwhile for the price!
Game bugs not yet mentioned:
- Beacon doesn't work quite right
- Space Airlock Doors are sometimes very odd (the display just goes up and down without the door being used)
- AI is still a bit silly :)

While the page fully warns people that this is still in its alpha stages it should not have been allowed to until at least a better running beta. As of right now the game is computer destroyingly broken as there are multiple problems with the game.
The Intro: As of right now there is not even a full bare bones intro to this game. While when first picking the area you will settle in you see multiple aspects in the upper right corner which mean nothing to you. However it does give the player some heads up after picking it what everything means. That is the only good thing I can say about the intro as is. The next second you are placed in space with three aliens and a pod which can be broken down for scrap and a few minutes of oxygen for each to try and figure out how to build a base. While I understand people hate the idea of tutorials that really drag on I would have preferred at least something to give me more information. My first time playing my entire crew died because instead of building as I instructed they mostly floated around space and then began to panic when their oxygen got low because no one worked.
The AI: Ok… Day One: Garry’s Incident I feel is one of the best examples of bad AI… this nearly reaches the same level of incompetence. In order for a crew member to do anything you must assign a job and where they will be in regards to some of the jobs like mining and building. While that’s fine by itself the AI doesn’t know what to do often times. They will lounge about the base or flat out ignore build orders or security beacons for when intruders come in guns blazing or fires because… I have absolutely no idea. The AI is unresponsive and more lazy than helpful and I feel like this would have been aided greatly by being able to tell them what to do The Sims style but the AI of course has free will… the free will to walk around doing nothing while I have set up a build order for oxygen recyclers which they need to live while their oxygen quickly is used up.
Building: There is barely any direction as to what to build when starting but common sense plays a part here. Of course they need oxygen, food, and a way for more resources and while all those work when the AI actually does their job… the rest is very lacking. There is no explanation as to why a pub, or a reactor, or really anything is important beyond just common sense guiding my actions to make me build them because, they are there so they must be useful. After all if they can make their own food they stop eating the same stuff from the food replicators.

Addendum: The game won't be finished and is an absolute insider tip for a waste of money. Clearly: Don't buy it."

Once you have your Seed placed you will go into the space base part where you will have 3 crew and 2000 matter (Currency) to start out with, but be warned as your crew only have a limited ammount of time until there oxygen runs out so you have to be quick building a simple foundation and a good amount of oxygen genorators. Now getting more crew is as simple as waiting for a ship to come by but be warned as it could be pirates who will latch onto your ship and try to kill your crew one by one unless you have a good defence, but it could be just people wanting to be crew of your station. Mining is also a main thing that you have to be checking as if you don't mine you will slowly runout of matter and have no more.

Your crew has needs such as; sleep, food and morale if any of these get low it can cause them to do their job slower, sleep longer of worse die so you do have to farm and have food replicaotrs to counter act this. Apart from the pirates being a thret  meteors can also hit the station and kill your crew so you have to be on the ball if you have a large station and have emergancy alert systems in place to get your crew out of danger.

So I watched as my worker scrambled to build the suit locker that would save his life only to be a few seconds too late.  He and the rest of my crew succumbed to the cruelest of fates; I can only hope it was painless.  Armed with new experience and a greater understanding of the fragility of life in space I took another bold step forward and my second base was born.  Things went much better for much longer.  The basics were established with ease and in a very timely fashion.  Mining operations were going smoothly and I was about to establish a pub for recreation and relaxation.  My builder was ordered to remove some interior walls in order to expand a room and it was hoped that he would finish the exterior walls first (you know the ones keeping the cold empty death void that is space outside of my lovely base.)  Alas this was not to be and as the second crew member was pulled into the blackness of both death and the cosmos I knew I had learned another valuable lesson in the fragility of life in space.  

With just these few experiences I must say that Spacebase DF-9 has a lot to offer even as an early release.  It is a little rough around the edges and your workers will tend to aggravate you with poor decision making, but stick with it and you will be proud of your accomplishments in time.  Failure and loss is a part of this game so don’t be too frustrated when you need to start over from scratch.  If you enjoy building and management games you should at least give this a shot.

First of all, there's very little you can do at the moment.
Build and maintain a space base.
And that's it.
And it quickly collapses.

You can't safely increase your population, and those you lose can only be replaced by tramp ships.
Once you reach about 30 people, you'll have more leeway, but until then, each person is extremely important.

There's no way to defend against meteorite (or debris or asteroid belt) impacts.
If a hole opens, anyone approaching will easily be sucked in and lost.

As for enemies, if they enter, everyone except the guards is completely defenseless and has no chance of escape, so they'll just be killed.
You basically have no advantage, and if you don't defeat them, everyone will be killed.

Because it's still in Alpha mode, it's safe to say the gameplay isn't quite there yet.
It's unclear how many additional features will be added in the future,

Game has a lot of potential! However it is still lacking.

For so reason security officers wont move to the beacons you place, but when they do they usually go outside under the base at the spot the beacon was placed instead of inside so it's VERY hard to defend your base. Works wont work half the time. Lastly in regards to bugs my middle room for no reason what so ever went down to 40% O2 and all my guys got stuck in the room next to the air lock (which had 70% O2). So I quite and came back hoping that would fix the bug, and every single room suddenly went to 0% O2 and half the people were already dead. the other 98% suffocated. saved and went back now my rooms are back to 98% O2 and 2 people survived. then one became a parasite and everyone died can't retake.

This is definitely a promising alpha, and many of the issues I'd mentioned in the previous version of my review have been fixed or improved.

- The technician AI is very much improved.
- I haven't run into issues with bartenders holding up people at the bar, except when I didn't have enough bartenders assigned, which seems reasonable
- Intruder defense seems more manageable now, though the actual mechanics don't seem to have changed.
- Haven't seen any more accidental depressurizations in a while

The only part that is still somewhat frustrating is the builder sequencing. While building walls and floors still seems to be prioritized above everything else, tear down or vaporizing unused areas is still prioritized above building other objects. I'd love to see a queue that I can prioritize, but failing that, at least making tear down/vaporizing last in the priority list would be an improvement. Even better than that would be only deprioritizing those tasks if they're part of unclaimed structures.

Some other issues I've noticed:
- Occasionally people will get stuck in airlocks and eventually suffocate
- There are sometimes odd placement issues with room objects randomly getting removed from the building queue, or sometimes not being able to place an object in a place that you should. I've had this happen with research consoles, beds, and rugs

--------------------------------------
Original Review
--------------------------------------

This looks promising, but in its current state, is not very fun to play. Most of the issues center around not-very-effective AI:

- In order to keep your base functioning, you need technicians to keep all the systems in repair. However, the technician AI is TERRIBLE, and there's no way to force a technician to repair a specific machine. The only way I've been able to play is to keep my base relatively small. Once a hostile docks with my station and as a result, adds more machines, it's an unrecoverable downhill slide to all machines eventually breaking down, no matter how many technicians I add. I've also seen my technicians attempting to repair broken machinery in areas I'm deconstructing, which is a huge waste of time.

- Your citizens need to eat. They also need to sleep. If they go to the bar to eat or drink, and the bartender isn't on duty, they'll wait until he is. Even if the bartender is, himself, waiting to eat or drink. The bartenders will not serve themselves, nor is there any sort of timer that allows them to give up and move on to do something else. There's also no way to force a bartender to go on duty. When your citizens get stuck waiting on food, it makes it very easy to start a downward spiral (especially for technicians) since they obviously aren't doing their jobs if they're waiting for food.

- Defending against intruders is incredibly unreliable. From what I can tell, you're supposed to assign citizens to security duty, and use a beacon to make them congregate in a specific area, either to explore or defend against intruders. In practice, they seem to take an ""I'll get to it when I'll get to it"" attitude, even when their comrades are getting gunned down around them.

- Sequencing building instructions is irritating - things seem to happen only in the order you enter them in - once you put in a request, there's no way to prioritize it against other requests, except to erase it and do it again, effectively putting it at the end of the queue. The exception seems to be building walls - those seem to get built before anything else.

- Citizens coming in and out of airlocks will occasionally kill their comrades by an ill-timed depressurization

Given this is an alpha, I'm guessing/hoping these issues will be smoothed out, but as it stands, it is more frustrating to play than enjoyable.","Update:

- Occasionally people will get stuck in airlocks and eventually suffocate
- There are sometimes odd placement issues with room objects randomly getting removed from the building queue, or sometimes not being able to place an object in a place that you should. I've had this happen with research consoles, beds, and rugs

--------------------------------------
Original Review
--------------------------------------

This looks promising, but in its current state, is not very fun to play. Most of the issues center around not-very-effective AI:

- In order to keep your base functioning, you need technicians to keep all the systems in repair. However, the technician AI is TERRIBLE, and there's no way to force a technician to repair a specific machine. The only way I've been able to play is to keep my base relatively small. Once a hostile docks with my station and as a result, adds more machines, it's an unrecoverable downhill slide to all machines eventually breaking down, no matter how many technicians I add. I've also seen my technicians attempting to repair broken machinery in areas I'm deconstructing, which is a huge waste of time.

- Your citizens need to eat. They also need to sleep. If they go to the bar to eat or drink, and the bartender isn't on duty, they'll wait until he is. Even if the bartender is, himself, waiting to eat or drink. The bartenders will not serve themselves, nor is there any sort of timer that allows them to give up and move on to do something else. There's also no way to force a bartender to go on duty. When your citizens get stuck waiting on food, it makes it very easy to start a downward spiral (especially for technicians) since they obviously aren't doing their jobs if they're waiting for food.

- Defending against intruders is incredibly unreliable. From what I can tell, you're supposed to assign citizens to security duty, and use a beacon to make them congregate in a specific area, either to explore or defend against intruders. In practice, they seem to take an ""I'll get to it when I'll get to it"" attitude, even when their comrades are getting gunned down around them.

- Sequencing building instructions is irritating - things seem to happen only in the order you enter them in - once you put in a request, there's no way to prioritize it against other requests, except to erase it and do it again, effectively putting it at the end of the queue. The exception seems to be building walls - those seem to get built before anything else.

- Citizens coming in and out of airlocks will occasionally kill their comrades by an ill-timed depressurization

Given this is an alpha, I'm guessing/hoping these issues will be smoothed out, but as it stands, it is more frustrating to play than enjoyable."

7900354,russian,2013.11.04 00:01,❌,✅,0.7717231512,132,"В текущем виде игра максимум на пару часов. Хорошего в игре только начальная атмосфера, если к настоящему релизу она сохранится и геймплей поменяется в какую-то комфортную сторону, то возможно надо будет поменять оценку. Мне нравятся sandbox'ы, эта игра в текущий момент якобы рекламируется как таковой. Но сейчас у текущего ""sandbox'а"" не чувствуется никакого назначения кроме как декоративного. 

Вам дают небольшой начальный ресурс и вы должны строить базу. Главный ресурс — условные единицы конструкции, их можно добывать разбирая построенное или собирая из расположенных в локации залежей. На базе можно построить несколько типов комнат в которых размещать объекты совместимые с типом комнаты. Для обслуживания объектов в ростере команды можно назначать роли. 

Через некоторые промежутки времени случаются рандомные события, пока только одного типа ""к вам хотят присоединиться или на вас хотят напасть"". Если на первых порах это будут просто новые астронавты, то на более поздних с большой вероятностью пришельцы изуродует вашу базу тем что разместит свою рядом или пристыкуют к вашей.

Баланс не обсуждаю, у альфы его было бы странно ожидать. В чем же проблема геймплея? В том что по сути вся игра это реагирование на случайные события, ваша кривая развития базы дает пару ударов сердца и навсегда умирает через 20 минут игры. Судя по обновлениям обещают ее растянуть на несколько часов. Дальше будет реагирование на случайные события. В плоском двумерном космическом пространстве бесконечность ограничена маленькой шириной размера квадрата игрового поля. А дух бесчисленных сценариев приключений областью нотификаций о новых сценариях (сейчас в количестве 1 штука).

Это не Тераррия с множеством ресурсов, противников и крафта. Не Майнкрафт в котором есть режим свободного творчества. Это Sim в котором вы можете обставить комнату только кактусом и телевизором на стене и нельзя переодевать персонажей.","In its current form, the game lasts a couple of hours at most. The only good thing about the game is its initial atmosphere. If it holds up and the gameplay improves in a more enjoyable way by the actual release, I might have to revise my rating. I like sandboxes; this game is currently being advertised as such. But right now, the current ""sandbox"" doesn't feel like it serves any purpose other than being decorative.

You're given a small starting resource and tasked with building a base. The main resource is construction units, which can be obtained by dismantling existing structures or assembled from deposits located throughout the location. You can build several types of rooms in your base, in which you can place objects compatible with the room type. You can assign roles to maintain these objects in your team roster.

Random events occur at regular intervals, but so far only one type is ""someone wants to join you or someone wants to attack you."" While initially these will simply be new astronauts, later on, aliens will likely cripple your base by placing theirs next to or docking with yours.

I'm not discussing balance; it would be strange to expect it in alpha. What's the problem with the gameplay? The whole game is essentially reacting to random events. Your base development curve takes a couple of heartbeats and then dies forever after 20 minutes of play. Judging by the updates, they promise to extend it to several hours. Later, there will be reactions to random events. In a flat, two-dimensional space, infinity is limited by the small width of the playing field. And the spirit of countless adventure scenarios is limited to notifications about new scenarios (currently, there's only one).

This isn't Terraria with its multitude of resources, enemies, and crafting. It's not Minecraft with its free-form mode. This is a Sim where you can only furnish a room with a cactus and a TV on the wall, and you can't change the characters' clothes."

*Inital Alpha review*

This game is fun to play. However, right now, at the very beginning of alpha stages it's not worth the price. There isn't a lot of content at this time. Plus the crew's AI amounts to a lemming mentality. One wrong event could send your whole crew blindly walking towards their deaths. That said, there is a lot of fun to be had. People have personalities and some of the events can really get hectic. I'll update as this game develops.","So Double Fine is a bad developer.
