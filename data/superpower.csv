(That's the gist of it, but CNC4 is so bad you can't find a single beggar in the reviews.)

[hr][/hr] Let me start by saying the nice things I can think of: If this were the first game made by a new studio, and all the campaign text and cutscenes were removed, I think it would be a good game. Thanks to EA for providing an excellent resource library for various mods. Okay, enough with the nice things, let's get to the rant.

> To simplify gameplay, we've optimized away the most crucial aspect of RTS games: the economy.

> Two (or more) different colored turtles crawl around creating a mess of units pieced together from unknown materials, which then either grind against each other or get instantly killed.

> Campaigns where the protagonist is sacrificed for the sake of sacrificing the protagonist—classic ""Wow, the protagonist/important character is here, I'm so touched!"" type of storyline.

> You won't see more than 10 people in the entire public chat channel in a day (this game deserves it).

""Then why do you play?"" ""Because I'm the biggest idiot.""

[i]The Command & Conquer series is one of the few good memories I can bring back from my childhood. I remember that playing games was one of the few times my father was emotionally stable. He wouldn't hysterically force me to practice his ""all other professions are inferior except for studying"" philosophy, nor would he try to belittle me to maintain his family status. He would discuss with me how to defend against AI attacks, how to strategize on the battlefield, and how to achieve victory. Unfortunately, those precious memories are gone, ruined by EA's Command & Conquer 4. EA isn't some entity ""existing to create something wonderful""; it's just ""another game company that exists solely to make money."" This ""CNC4"" thing is like my life: ""I don't know what it's describing, I don't know what it's accomplishing, I don't know how I survived, I don't know how it was delivered, but it's something, it's passable, and that's it."" I don't know how to continue writing now; I'm numb. Let's just pretend this isn't a CNC game, but a prototype made by some unknown small studio; at least that way, we can both feel a little better."

Nothing in this game screams command and conquer at all. It's as if this game tried to mix elements of command and conquer, StarCraft, and MOBA, and miserably failed at capturing beloved elements from the 3 games.

Gameplay is horridly restrictive, forcing you to choose between offense, defense, and support MCVs, each with their own unique unit lineup, and any change of tactics requires you to stay incapacitated until the new MCV arrives. 

Units just pump out without the need of any resources, and you need to progress your levels to unlock said units.

Attacks don't feel impactful at all, you can have 50 units worth of airships hammering down on a single infantry and it still takes forever to eliminate them.

Unless you play defense MCV, there's no such thing as building a base in this game.

I know this has been released for a long time already, but EA should've made another franchise instead of sticking this experimental crap to the Tiberium series. 

If you're reading this, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME solo, unless you're purchasing the command and conquer bundle on sale.","Sorry not sorry, but this is the crappiest command and conquer game I ever had the displeasure of playing. Nothing in this game screams command and conquer at all. It's as if this game tried to mix elements of command and conquer, StarCraft, and MOBA, and miserably failed at capturing beloved elements from the 3 games.

Gameplay is horridly restrictive, forcing you to choose between offense, defense, and support MCVs, each with their own unique unit lineup, and any change of tactics requires you to stay incapacitated until the new MCV arrives. 

Units just pump out without the need of any resources, and you need to progress your levels to unlock said units.

Attacks don't feel impactful at all, you can have 50 units worth of airships hammering down on a single infantry and it still takes forever to eliminate them.

Unless you play defense MCV, there's no such thing as building a base in this game.

我玩过很多RTS游戏,但是这是我目前见过最差劲的一部作品.我最近刚购入C&C全系列,没想到这么快就吃到纯正大粪了!首先:steam上下载的资源是有问题的,不能直接打开;游戏本身玩法和质量有巨大的问题.删除了资源采集和电量但是只有人口上限是让我刚上手就感到及其诧异的设计,你能想象吗?超巨型坦克和一个工兵的建造只有时间上的差距;升级单位的设计很像魔兽争霸和星际争霸[b]可是傻逼EA抄袭都不会抄[/b],游戏本身服务器也极其不稳定,经常发生掉线,而且掉线就会导致我的战役白打;游戏对话没有字幕,没有简体中文(只有繁体中文),让新手教程就堪比仙家对话;cg便宜感十足,2010 年的游戏cg比不上2000年的红色警戒2,在演员服装设计,背景设计上就非常廉价简陋(而且捧读感很严重,气笑了);[strike] 单位艺术风格很奇怪(这条纯属主观看法).[/strike] 升级解锁科技就像星际争霸2合作战役,但是星际争霸2合作战役是他妈pve啊,你他妈pvp锁科技是哪个傻逼想出来的?!你是不是觉得通过打战役升级解锁单位比每关锁科技的设计精明很多啊云A???浪费我6GB校园网流量下载的一大坨狗屎,[b]还没到2062年,可喜可贺的是EA全体员工的父母已经濒临灭绝![/b]

I recently bought the entire C&C series, and I didn't expect to be eating pure garbage so soon! First of all: the resources downloaded from Steam are faulty and cannot be opened directly; the gameplay and quality of the game itself have huge problems. The removal of resource gathering and power, but only the population cap, is a design that surprised me from the very beginning. Can you imagine? The only difference between building a super-giant tank and an engineer is the time difference; the unit upgrade design is very similar to Warcraft and Starcraft [b]but the stupid EA can't even copy properly[/b]; the game server itself is extremely unstable, frequently disconnecting, and disconnecting means I've wasted my campaign time; the game dialogue has no subtitles, no simplified Chinese (only traditional Chinese), making the tutorial feel like a fairy dialogue; the CGs feel cheap, like something out of 2010. The game's CG in 2000 is inferior to that of Red Alert 2 in 2000. The costume and background design are incredibly cheap and simplistic (and the feel of it being presented in a poorly written way is ridiculous). [strike] The unit art style is strange (this is purely a subjective opinion).[/strike] Upgrading and unlocking technology is like StarCraft 2's cooperative campaign, but StarCraft 2's cooperative campaign is PvE! Who the hell came up with the idea of ​​locking technology in PvP?! Do you think that upgrading and unlocking units through campaigns is much smarter than locking technology in each level? Wow, that's ridiculous! I wasted 6GB of my campus network downloading this garbage. [b]It's not even 2062 yet, and thankfully, the parents of all EA employees are on the verge of extinction![/b]

1. When you want to change the graphics settings, the game will crash. It doesn't just hang and take a minute to change them, it straight-up CTDs. So you're stuck playing the first mission in 800*600 and minimum graphics, even if you change them using driver suite software.

2. The new mechanics force you to choose a class. Support, Offence, or Defence, and build units. Wouldn't be an issue but you only have a limited number of swaps per instance. So if you're playing solo and are new to the game, this will get you caught out at least once.

3. Camera zoom is way too high. This is personal preference, of course, but it doesn't allow you to really see much going on outside of the immediate zone of control, severely hampering tactical awareness.

4. Story writing is bad. Just poorly written, badly acted, and not immersive in the way the older games were.

- I'm forced to log in to launch the game, but the ""create an account"" button leads to a page that doesn't allow account creation.

- After finding my login details, I log in, and the game launches (in 800x600 resolution, lol).

- Cutscene
- Login screen in the game, with the same login details... why?

- I go into the options to change the resolution: the game crashes every time.

EA is showing its true colors once again with this game that simply won't launch."

[h2]História[/h2]
[b] Cerca de 15 anos depois Tiberium Wars e 10 anos depois dos eventos de Kane's Wrath.
Em 2062, o Tiberium espalhou-se de forma descontrolada e ameaça a vida na Terra, com previsão de tornar o planeta inabitável até 2068. 
A humanidade encontra-se à beira da extinção..
Kane líder Brotherhood of Nod (Nod), chega à sede da GDI com uma proposta irrecusável, com o artefato Tacitus e os recursos da GDI para construir uma rede que controla o Tiberium.
Assim juntos criaram: Tiberium Control Network (TCN), com o objectivo de controlar o Tiberium e transformá-lo numa fonte de energia barata. 
A campanha em si começa 15 anos após a formação da aliança, quando a Rede de Controle de Tiberium se aproxima da conclusão.
No entanto, extremistas de ambas as facções GDI & Nod começam a causar agitação, o que desencadeia a Quarta Guerra de Tiberium.
O jogador assume o papel do Comandante: Parker, oficial militar da GDI que recebe um implante óptico após ferimentos em batalha que teve uma perca total da visão. 
O jogador tem a possibilidade de ajudar os extremistas da GDI da Coronel Louise James ou as forças leais a Nod de Kane na Quarta Guerra do Tiberium.[/b]

作为命令与征服的作品，删去了资源采集加上了人口限制，我玩命征就是冲着你没有人口上限来的，再说命征的电力系统不也是另外一种博弈手段？你命征4直接不伦不类的，我玩的不是星际争霸，是泰伯利亚
EA这群家伙是怎么想出来的？作为2010年的游戏，质量甚至没2008年的红警3与2007年的C&C3泰伯利亚战争，甚至是2003年的命令与征服:将军强
我真的想不明白，我真的想不通为什么EA总是能做到取其糟粕去其精华的
致敬传奇IP毁灭者EA","I rarely criticize a game.

Even less often do I buy a game specifically to criticize it.

But C&C4 did it.

As the final installment of the Tiberium series in Command & Conquer, it successfully cemented one of the greatest RTS series, a classic IP on par with Warcraft, StarCraft, and Age of Empires, in its final resting place.

As a Command & Conquer title, it removed resource gathering and added population limits. I play Command & Conquer precisely because it has no population cap. Besides, isn't the power system another strategic element? Command & Conquer 4 is a complete mess. I'm not playing StarCraft, I'm playing Tiberium.

What were these guys at EA thinking? As a 2010 game, its quality isn't even as good as Red Alert 3 (2008), Tiberium Wars (2007), or even Command & Conquer: Generals (2003).

I really don't understand. I really can't understand why EA always manages to take the dross and discard the essence.

A tribute to the legendary IP destroyer, EA."

“Tiberium Twilight” is the last instalment of the famous Command & Conquer real time strategy series. Officially dubbed “C&C 4”, it’s actually number 9 if counting all the main games bearing the title (including the first-person shooter “Renegade” and excluding add-ons). Looking back at a long history and tradition of fast-paced base building, resource gathering and amassing big armies, at least in the 2D isometric games. The latest ones were trying to bring more of the “rock-paper-scissors” mechanics into the gameplay, with C&C Generals Zero Hour and Tiberium Twilight as the highest form of it. That also meant reducing or even eliminating the base-building and resource-gathering components. Generally speaking, C&C 4 is hence somewhat the last (yet in my view unfinished) step in a journey to adjust the series to a different play style with a potential reboot that was being discussed around the time of the release in 2010. The latter was dropped quickly after the commercial failure of C&C 4 and the demise of RTS in general.

The plot of the game continues and concludes the alternate future time line in which the world was dominated by two factions, Nod and GDI, picking up right after “C&C 3 - Tiberium Wars” quite well. Otherwise, unfortunately, the game itself feels incomplete and unbalanced on several accounts as well as falling short again on long-needed improvements on year-old problems such as a limited graphics engine and very low unit AI. Additionally, all the fans of the series who have loved the game especially because of the traditional mechanics might have their issues because of the new play styles. 

After about 13 hours of play time in a normal approach, here’s my pros/cons list:

Pros: 
+ seamlessly continues story after C&C3 and its add-on
+ high quality cutscenes and good quality actors
+ last and final appearance of Kane
+ interesting conclusion of the timeline, Tiberium infestation, the Nod cult and the legendary figure of Kane
+ great graphics
+ new strategic elements of mobile bases (= crawlers)
+ mutant area mission level design well done and detailed
+ interesting story in general
+ 3 tactics styles to choose from (offensive, defensive, support)
+ great unit detail
+ generally kept look & feel of C&C series

Cons:
-	Game mechanics feel like they were geared towards teams of up to 3 players cooperating in multiplayer matches against others, especially since some units and tactical advantages are missing when playing as single player
-	Kane by now definitely had many more lives than a cat
-	Apart from Kane, his cult and Tiberium conclusion, the plot remains shallow and rather bland
-	Rock-papers-scissors mechanics not working in single player missions due to missing variety in units available by only being able to choose 1 tactic at a time, limiting options drastically
-	Level-up to unlock higher units in most cases unobtainable and hence a player would choose a different approach --> balancing issue
-	Stealing big units from the enemy NPC can become main tactic in winning the single player campaign
-	Command points (= max unit number) limitation too low in single player missions to be able to stand a good chance against the enemy early on in many cases --> balancing issue
-	Missing option to tilt crawler position --> unfinished game element
-	Many missions are trail & error of each of the 3 tactical choices --> balancing issue
-	Unfair nuclear rocket behaviour in last GDI mission --> balancing issue
-	Super overpowered Arcus GDI enemy unit in last Nod mission making it nearly unbeatable --> balancing issue
-	Very unfair Nod pre-order bonus mission “Night Moves” --> balancing issue
-	Game is missing explanation of what the advantages are to capture some buildings on the map, players need to find out by themselves
-	Graphics engine is fixed to 30 fps due to necessary internal game speed regulation
-	AI of units still super low which requires lots of micromanagement (they can’t even pick the enemy which they are the strongest against or move in formations without blocking each other all the time)
-	Micromanagement of units decreases real tactical orders and behaviours to be expected of a modern RTS
-	AI still has wayfinding issues on the map
-	Despite resource gathering and base building eliminated, funny enough, the gameplay feels much slower compared to predecessors
-	Campaign missions rather boring and uninspired which is very sad compared to the super fun, varied missions of Red Alert 3
-	Tedious campaign missions, especially because of re-spawning crawlers (= mobile bases)
-	Soundtrack without any C&C characteristics, sounds more like a mix of Star Wars, Indiana Jones and psychedelic Japanese singing
-	Missing detailed explanation of 3 tactics, including differences in units etc.
-	Graphic bugs appeared several times, persisting throughout whole missions
-	Some game crashes
-	Annoying double login forced on player before game start and just before the main menu without option to save login information
-	Story ending of Kane somewhere between stupid (GDI part) and well done (general conclusion)
-	The protagonist’s wife is such a silly damsel in distress, unlike all the other strong women in earlier instalments

Conclusion:
Although C&C 4 wraps up the Tiberium timeline quite well, the plot is very shallow and boring. The new mechanics introduced appear to be unfinished and badly balanced, making many missions very tedious and sometimes even highly frustrating. I generally liked the look & feel of the game and was eager to try out a new tactical approach to the game play, but the downsides tainted my experience quite a lot. Hence, I can only recommend the game to anyone who wants to know about the conclusion of the series from a plot standpoint. From an RTS perspective, the game is rather disappointing, especially after an amazing Red Alert 3.

I bought the C&C Bundle with the interest of trying out the classics and C&C:4. 

I tried to boot up C&C4, same problems as other C&C games thanks to E.A scuffage of the IP - requiring online access and an EA account at all times with no offline option. Requires 2 separate login screens - the 2nd login screen is where the game-breaking bug occurs.

According to the Community, C&C4's 2nd login screen only accepts E.A Account passwords under 7 characters. Passwords over 8 characters will fail, and there is also a Character limit of about 14 characters.

There is no known bypass or fix for this bug.

I hope there is a fix, because I doubt this is the only C&C game affected by E.A's blasted logins and online-only enforcement.

Maybe a cracked version somewhere on the high seas exists without the Online requirement and E.A's nonsense.

I bought the C&C Bundle with the interest of trying out the classics and C&C:4. 

I tried to boot up C&C4, same problems as other C&C games thanks to E.A scuffage of the IP - requiring online access and an EA account at all times with no offline option. Requires 2 separate login screens - the 2nd login screen is where the game-breaking bug occurs.

Bohužel po nainstalování je povinná registrace, což by mi tolik nevadilo (na druhou stranu proč vůbec s tím hráče obtěžovat, že?), kdyby normálně fungovala. Nejdřív jsem zkusil registraci přes steam, což se přihlásilo, vyskočila mi reklama na další hry od EA, ale přihlašovací údaje do hry jsem nedostal. OK, pokus č.2 přes email. Registrace přes email již existuje - fajn, zadám heslo, to je dokonce správně, nicméně raději budeme posílat ještě kód na email (který nepřišel). Říkám si OK, je mi vlastně jedno na jaký email to budu hrát, tak jsem dal novou registraci na nový email. Tam jsem se (po cca 30 minutách zbytečného registrování) dostal k ""hádankám"", že jsem člověk. Pochopit lámanou češtinou (nejlepší je, když AI generuje ověřovač, kterým ověří, že jsem člověk, to považuju za opravdový gól), co je vůbec cílem mi chvíli trvalo, po odkliknutí jsem musel absolvovat další dvě podobné hádanky a nakonec jsem se dozvěděl, že nejsem člověk. Inu, taky nemusím hrát všechno. V EA jsou fakt tragédi, až se tomu těžko věří. :-( Poslední hra od EA, kterou jsem zakoupil (byť to bylo v bundlu).","I wanted to try the game because I'm a big fan of this series. Unfortunately, after installation, registration is mandatory, which I wouldn't mind so much (on the other hand, why bother the player with that, right?), if it worked normally. First, I tried registering via Steam, which logged in, an ad for other EA games popped up, but I didn't get the login details for the game. OK, try no. 2 via email. Registration via email already exists - fine, I'll enter the password, that's even correct, however, we'd rather send a code to the email (which didn't come). I think OK, I don't really care what email I'm going to play it on, so I registered again on a new email. There (after about 30 minutes of unnecessary registration) I got to the ""riddles"" that I'm human. It took me a while to understand in broken Czech (the best thing is when the AI ​​generates a verifier to verify that I'm human, I consider that a real goal), what the goal is, after clicking away I had to complete two more similar puzzles and finally I learned that I'm not human. Well, I don't have to play everything either. There are so many tragedies in EA that it's hard to believe. :-( The last game from EA that I bought (even if it was in a bundle)."

Tiene 2 Campañas, la GDI y NOD, cada una progresa de acuerdo a como va la historia del C&C, podes hacer misiones cooperativas, lo cual esta bastante interesante Y tiene workshop y editor de niveles.

What does the title offer? It's a bit more in line with Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War 3 in terms of gameplay. It has RTS elements, but they're more simplified when it comes to base building.
It maintains the visual style established in the last installment, which moves away from traditional warfare towards a more futuristic approach, reminiscent of Starcraft, Dune, and to a lesser extent, Warhammer.

It has two campaigns, GDI and NOD, each progressing according to the C&C storyline. You can do cooperative missions, which is quite interesting, and it also has a workshop and level editor.

Unfortunately, it doesn't have achievements or trading cards, and there are a few login issues, but aside from that, it's a great title; you just have to know how to enjoy it.

★☆☆☆☆ (1/5)

Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight had the potential to be something unique, but the execution is missing something crucial. Instead of refining classic RTS mechanics, it replaces them with a limited, shallow system where strategy takes a backseat. The removal of base building and resource management leads to restrictive, small-scale battles that lack depth. The mobile base (Crawler) concept could have been interesting, but in practice, it makes everything feel constrained rather than dynamic.

The campaign doesn’t help. The story is rushed and unsatisfying, and the characters are bland with lifeless performances. Even Kane, usually a commanding presence, feels dumbed down and uninspired. There’s no real emotional weight to the narrative, and none of the characters leave a lasting impact.

I have tried the multiplayer, but it made the game a bit less boring. If the core gameplay is this flawed, no amount of online play can fix it.

The way this plays is like anything but the previous titles that came before this abomination. It is fully deserving of having the negative review score that it does along with just never being mentioned about in the C&C fan base as an official game. Allow me to list as to why this is one of the worst RTS games I have ever played.

The leveling progression system:
Unlike the previous titles, where the way you unlocked more units and structures throughout the campaign, the way the progression system works is what I would expect to see in a MMO RPG game like World of Warcraft, not in a RTS game. In order to unlock more units, structures, and upgrades, you have to earn XP in game and level up to unlock more. Which makes this game outrageously difficult starting at the beginning. Especially in the campaigns, where AI enemies are absurdly strong having everything unlocked in the first missions, while you're stuck with the most basic of units that can barely do anything. This ultimately turns the game into a grind fest for the campaign missions and skirmish matches, just to be able to unlock more units and tech to make the game easier. And of course, levels you gain through NOD and GDI are earned separately, so you're having to grind as each faction to unlock more tech.

Unit cap and game play mechanics:
The unit cap in this game is absolutely obnoxious and unnecessary, especially since none of the prior titles ever had unit limits integrated into them (except for the console versions of RA3 and Tib wars 3 & Kanes Wrath due to hardware limitations on Xbox and Playstation), which makes the game feel smaller since you're now commanding only small squads of units instead of whole armies. The most you'll ever get for unit cap is around 50-60 unit points for campaign, and up to 90 unit points in skirmish or online matches. And it is horribly small, especially since a lot of the units take around 6-8 unit points, so you don't get to really build much of an army, as much as you get more of just a large squad of units instead. Of course, this can easily get broken if you get the husk repair upgrades while playing as Offense crawlers.

Speaking of which, instead of MCVs, you get a production unit/structure called a ""crawler"" instead. These just build all your vehicles, infantry, and aircraft instead of traditional productions buildings in prior games. This mechanic is one I hate the most, as I enjoyed having like 8-10 barracks or war factories just pumping out a massive army of units. Instead, you only get to build one unit at a time, with a max of five being able to be stored in your crawler while it's mobile. And the only crawler that can even build any sort of structures is the defense crawler, but that only builds bases defenses and nothing else.

Game play experience:
The fact that C&C 4 is an always online game means that you have to log into an EA account in order to get online and play this game. It doesn't matter how or which platform you use to play this, you still need an EA account just to be able to even fully launch this game. Even then, good luck trying to get on, as I've had multiple times where I'd randomly get forced out of a game due to connection issues and be forced to log back in, losing any experience that I gained during the middle of a match or campaign mission.

Overall summary:
I wouldn't consider this even an official C&C game. The way it plays and functions strays so far away from the C&C game series that it shouldn't even classify as one. The game play mechanics aren't enjoyable and generic at best, the level progression system makes this game grindier than it ever needed to be, and there's so many technical issues that it makes it honestly difficult to play. This is a game I would honestly recommend any C&C fan to steer clear from.

193271976,german,2025.03.21 19:13,❌,✅,0.5551257133,4,"Spiel via Sammelbox im Angebot erhalten.

Nach der Installation musste ich mir erstmal einen EA-Account erstellen.

Nachdem ich nach ca. 2 Stunden endlich schaffte über den Launcher hinaus das Spiel zu starten,
durfte ich mich erstmal 4 mal hintereinander mit beträchtlichen Ladezeiten bei EA anmelden.
Dazu kam, dass das Spiel danach mehrere male abstürzte.
Das 4 malige Anmelden bei EA war jedoch nicht vergänglich und musste bei jedem Neustart erneut durchgeführt werden.

Die Lösung des START-Problems liegt mir übringens nicht vor. Kurz bevor ich es aufgeben wollte versuchte ich es noch ein allerletztes mal ohne jegliche Änderungen. Das Spiel selbst lässt sich übrigens ohne Internet-Zugang nicht starten.

Als ich dann zum allerersten mal das Menü zu sehen bekam,
erinnerte es mich ein wenig an eine komplett abgespeckte Version von C&C-Generals, nur in richtig billig.

Ein riesiger trostloser Chat, permanent aktiv, am unteren Bildschirmrand, angebliche Spieler die darin durchgehend angezeigt werden, aber keiner schreibt noch reagiert.

In den Optionen musste ich erstmal die Grafikeinstellungen hoch drehen.
Denn das Spiel schien mein FullHD-Display mit einer Auflösung von 860x640p und komplett minimalen Einstellungen als empfehlenswert zu betrachten. Danach wurde es aber auch nicht schöner.

Um rein zu kommen wollte ich zuallererst mal ein Gefecht gegen die KI starten,
bis ich die Option fand vergingen Minuten. Die Struktur des Menüs wechselte plötzlich von Hoch/Runter nach Links/Rechts.

Es gibt augenscheinlich keine richtigen Einstellungen für Gefechte,
ist aber auch egal, denn mehr als einen 3 Minuten ""Bitte Warten"" Timer bekam ich über eine Stunde Wartezeit nicht zu sehen.
Gefechte gegen die KI lassen sich einfach nicht starten.

Also startete ich den Story-Modus,
bei dem die ersten 3 Missionen scheinbar das Tutorial sind, waren mega schlecht, und waren gleichzeitig eine Einleitung in die Geschichte. Die Zwischensequenzen kommen in der gesamten Breite in Qualität nach C&C-1.

Die Grafik des Spiels ist absolute Katastrophe und schaut aus wie an C&C-Generals angelegt,
aber um mehr als 80% reduziert. Die Effekte und Bewegungsanimationen der Einheiten sehen so dermaßen schei...., billig aus, dass niemals das Gefühl aufkommt man würde mit schwerer Kiregsmaschinerie über das Schlachtfeld ziehen.

Wie bereits bekannt der nicht existierende Basisbau,
Gott sei dank gibt es keinen Basisbau, ich glaube ich hätte bei dieser schlechten Grafik/Animation das kotzen bekommen.
Nein ernsthaft... WO IST DER BASISBAU ???

Da es keine Bau-Voraussetzungen via ""baue DIES und bekomme Zugang zu DAS"" mehr gibt,
müssen Einheiten jetzt im gesamten Spiel, wie bei einem Multiplayer-EgoShooter, via Prestige-Ranking freigeschaltet werden.

Zusatzoptionen wie Untertitel funktionieren auch nur Just for Fun.

Ich hab nach nicht mal 3 Stunden das Spiel wieder aus gemacht.
Davon habe ich rund mehr als die Hälfte im Menü, in den Optionen, am meisten in Warteschleifen und ein wenig im Chat verbracht in dem ich hoffte mal jemanden zu erwischen der auch mal auf meine Fragen reagiert.
Bis auf eine Hand voll fragwürdiger Reaktionen auf Englisch, gehe ich davon aus das es sich wohl möglich um Bots handelt.

Fazit: Absolut kein bisschen zu empfehlen, nicht einmal ansatzweise. !!!!!!

PS: Ich suche immer noch die Funktion das Spiel wieder auf normalem Wege vom Rechner zu DEINSTALLIEREN.","I received the game via a bundle deal.

After installation, I first had to create an EA account.

After about two hours, I finally managed to get past the launcher and start the game,

but then I had to log in to EA four times in a row, with considerable loading times.

On top of that, the game crashed several times afterward.

The four logins to EA weren't permanent and had to be repeated every time I restarted the game.

I still don't have a solution for the startup problem. Just before I was about to give up, I tried one last time without making any changes. The game itself can't be started without an internet connection.

When I finally saw the menu for the very first time,

it reminded me a bit of a completely stripped-down version of C&C Generals, only really cheap.

A huge, dreary chat window, permanently active, at the bottom of the screen, supposedly showing players, but no one was typing or responding.

In the options menu, I first had to crank up the graphics settings.

The game seemed to consider my FullHD display with a resolution of 860x640p and completely minimum settings as suitable. Even after that, it didn't look any better.

To get started, I wanted to start a battle against the AI,

but it took minutes to find the option. The menu structure suddenly changed from Up/Down to Left/Right.

There don't seem to be any proper settings for battles,

but it doesn't really matter, because all I saw for over an hour was a 3-minute ""Please Wait"" timer.

Battles against the AI ​​simply won't start.

So I started the story mode,

where the first three missions seem to be the tutorial. They were incredibly bad and simultaneously served as an introduction to the story. The cutscenes, in terms of quality, are on par with C&C-1.

The game's graphics are an absolute disaster and look like they're based on C&C Generals,

but reduced by more than 80%. The effects and movement animations of the units look so incredibly cheap and awful that you never get the feeling you're driving heavy military machinery across the battlefield.

As already mentioned, there's no base building.

Thank goodness there isn't; I think I would have been sick of such terrible graphics and animation.

Seriously though... WHERE IS THE BASE BUILDING???

Since there are no more building prerequisites like ""build THIS and get access to THAT,""
units now have to be unlocked throughout the entire game, like in a multiplayer first-person shooter, via prestige rankings.

Additional options like subtitles only work for fun.

I turned the game off after less than three hours.

I spent well over half of that time in the menu, in the options, mostly in queues, and a little in the chat hoping to finally get someone to answer my questions.

Apart from a handful of questionable responses in English, I assume they're all bots.

Conclusion: Absolutely not recommended, not even remotely. !!!!!!

PS: I'm still looking for the function to uninstall the game from my computer the normal way."

Although I'd heard that the fourth installment was awful, I didn't expect it to be this bad after playing for a few dozen minutes. This game is like a pseudo-human, a half-hearted attempt to pass itself off as CNC. Some parts seem to echo the previous games, but they're just clumsy imitations. The game system is completely nerfed and has been condemned to death. Besides, while the unit models are cartoonish, they don't improve recognizability at all. The units are so huge that you can't fit several on screen at once. The navigation is terrible; you can't even navigate manually when there's a traffic jam. Entering the game requires entering your account and password twice, and after playing for forty minutes, it suddenly crashes and asks me to log in again. To make such a awful game and still put it in such a classic series as a legitimate sequel is truly appalling. I have nothing to say to EA. This game is an insult to my library."

It's a lousy clicker for people with an IQ as high as my stinking, week-old sock. Poor unit limits, minimal base and unit management, poor cutscenes, and so on. I really wonder what motivated the people who designed this thing, let alone those who released it after verifying its ""quality."" Even free is too much for this game.

1 Вы хотите узнать концовку серии игр.
На этом всё

Минусы
1 Это сам геймплей теперь у вас нет денег все войска бесплатные но всё завязано на лимите войск
2 Нужен интернет при чём входить нужно дваждый при каждом запуске к игре! 
3 1 день зашёл играл норм, 2 день выбило какую то ошибку но игра зашла день 3 игра выдала ошибку несоответствие непонятно чего и решила больше не запускаться! Заебись! Виндовс 11 официальный 
4 Однообразный сюжет  Фактически мы играем в одни и те же миссии но по разные стороны, а концовка для главного героя одна.... То есть для нас а также для сюжета в целом... (У нас типо есть тело а сюжет это История тиберия и побелитель он не изменен!)
5 Вы не захотите играть в это онлайн да и врядли найдёте соперников. Игра в онлайн это захват точек и всё. (По скрипту игру проходил всю на пиратке на старом ПК лет 10 незад.) 

Худшая игра в серии игр!
","Reasons for purchasing

1. You want to know the ending of the game series.

That's all.

Cons

1. The gameplay itself: now you have no money, all troops are free, but everything is tied to a troop limit.

2. You need an internet connection, and you have to log in twice each time you launch the game!

3. I logged in on day 1 and played fine. Day 2. I got some kind of error, but the game launched. Day 3. The game returned an error about an inconsistency and decided not to launch anymore! Awesome! Windows 11 is official.

4. Monotonous plot. We essentially play the same missions, but from different sides, and the ending for the main character is the same... That is, for us and for the plot as a whole... (We supposedly have a body, but the plot is the History of Tiberius and Whitewasher, it hasn't changed!)

5. You won't want to play this online, and you're unlikely to find opponents. Online games are just capturing points, that's all. (I played the entire game using a pirated version on an old PC about 10 years ago, according to the script.)

The worst game in the series!

缺点：其他都是。
1.优化一坨翔。分辨率愣是没整明白，各种进不了游戏，搞个窗口化简简单单，或者弄个启动器设置选项。别整钥匙在宝箱里了行么？
2.游戏性总的来说，是一个让人拼操作的伪高玩游戏。让你迅速凑十几个相生相克的飞机坦克，然后搭配各种属性的技能，占塔或者搬宝石+比微操。太小众，入门难，没2个月别想玩明白，劝退99%的人。
3.最搞笑的是，兵种和技能要你升级经验才能获得，真TM搞笑中的搞笑，不然你就机枪兵VS对面各种战舰和要塞吧。
同样RA2，一个公司，你看看生命力。真别瞎作，创新是双面刃，创新创死的公司，远比一成不变被淘汰的公司多。
当然差评如潮也不是随随便便能得到的，而这个游戏就是那个王中王。","Pros: Good quality, good art, good music; made to AAA standards.

Cons: Everything else is bad.

1. Optimization is terrible. The resolution is still not fixed, causing various game crashes. A simple windowed mode or a launcher settings option is much better. Stop hiding the keys in treasure chests!

2. Gameplay: Overall, it's a pseudo-high-skill game that relies on skillful maneuvering. It forces you to quickly assemble a dozen or so mutually reinforcing and countering aircraft and tanks, then combine various attribute skills to capture towers or collect gems, requiring precise micro-management. Too niche, difficult to learn, and you won't understand it in less than two months, deterring 99% of players.

3. The most ridiculous thing is that unit types and skills require experience to acquire. It's utterly absurd. Otherwise, you'd be playing as a machine gunner against various enemy warships and fortresses.

Similarly, RA2, from the same company, look at its lifespan. Don't be reckless; innovation is a double-edged sword. Far more companies die from innovation than from stagnation.

Of course, receiving overwhelmingly negative reviews isn't something that happens easily, and this game is the king of kings."

My verdict is that this game is probably more fun for casual gamers and not serious RTS players. The gameplay was definitely watered down from the previous installments. I am a loyal C&C fan, so I wanted to play it to keep up with the overall storyline and check out some of the units.

PROS:
1. I did not think the units were that cartoony. I was impressed to see how they advanced. 
A. TITANS are back. Got to love mechs! Everything is bigger and more mechanized than before.
2. Excellent graphics that don't require a super expensive graphics card.
3. Classes can be fun to play and less stressful if you are a casual player. The whole game is very relaxed for a C&C game. I realize this is not the intent of most RTS games. Lol

CONS
1. Acting is awkward and stiff. Eg; Commander's wife.
2. While I like the soundtrack somewhat better than C&C 3's, it will never measure up to Frank Klepacki's backing tracks.
3. Mobile MCV game style is annoying. I miss building bases.
4. Female voice overs are annoying. I think it was clear the devs are trying to boast girl power, which I dislike and am strongly against having this kind of undertone in one of my favorite games.

5. The plot is interesting enough, but not great. It is all about the containment of tiberium on Earth and Nod forces are cooperating with, but also betraying, GDI forces. This is sort of a repeat of some of the last game's storyline. There are no scrin in this game because they had been pushed out and retreated in the last game. Still, it would have been more interesting to see them return. I guess this leaves room for a potential C&C5.

The worst moment comes at the end of the NOD campaign when she cries over her hubby's death. It just feels so forced and unnatural.

2. Disappointing Music
The soundtrack is a letdown. The GDI music is passable, but the NOD tracks completely miss the mark. Instead of capturing NOD’s signature dark and intense vibe, it sounds more like tribal chanting from some random village in Kuvukiland.

3. Strange Unit Scaling
The proportions of some units are way off. Certain vehicles are unnecessarily large.. take The Forgotten's ""school bus"" for example. It’s somehow the same size as a Mammoth Tank, which is just ridiculous.

4. Weak Sound Design
The weapon sounds are underwhelming. Guns, cannons, rockets—none of them have the impact they should. Even the legendary Obelisk of Light no longer gives off that powerful ""ZWEEENG"" sound. And the rocket visuals? They're so tiny, they look more like fireworks than deadly projectiles.

At the beginning, you're asked for an EA login (even for single-player). I tried logging in with the correct credentials, but every time I got a general system error.

There are dozens of people online describing the same problem. It's probably related to the servers being shut down."

Краулеры бывают оборонные, наступательные и поддержки. По сути - игра сводится к скорейшему созданию юнитов и их быстрейшей прокачке. Количество бойцов ограничено, только в этом и сложность.","[Kane looks at you with a smirk]

If If you're familiar with the Tiberium Wars series, it's probably no secret that these strategy games are captivating. The fourth installment is released on a new engine, and the core of the game has undergone a number of changes: there's no longer any need to earn money or build bases (the defensive crawler is an exception, but more on that later). The construction center or headquarters have been replaced by crawlers, which combine all the functions of a base. Crawlers can be defensive, offensive, or supportive. Essentially, the game boils down to quickly creating units and leveling them up. The number of units is limited, and that's the only challenge."

So, overwhelmingly negative status, huh? You don't see that often. Also, it's a well-known fact that this game is a series killer. That's right. One of the most influential and important series for the RTS genre, the one that shaped and defined it the way we know it today was destroyed by this little fella here. How did that happen? To understand that we should first go for a quick summary.

1992 – [b]Dune II[/b] is released. Based on [b]David Lynch[/b]'s adaptation of [b]Frank Herbert[/b]'s novel, it introduced series' core gameplay. We were collecting [b]Spice[/b] with out harvester vehicles to earn credits and then spending those credits to build ourselves base and an army. 1995 – the first [b]C&C[/b] is made. While being spiritual successor of [b]Dune II[/b], the game had much more serious tone, while also including FMV elements. 1996 – [b]Red Alert[/b]. Pretty much the same thing with [b]C&C[/b], just with some improvements, naval battles [i]and[/i] an important backstory to [b]C&C[/b] villain – [b]Kane[/b], who was revealed as evil mastermind behind the humanity's major history events. 1997 – [b]Sole Survivor[/b]. Failed attempt for online-only deathmatch experience based on the original [b]C&C[/b] game.

1999 – [b]Tiberian Sun[/b]. The first game after [b]EA[/b] acquisition. Originally planned as much more complicated project, it ended up feeling a bit rushed, but still, in many ways it was a sequel everybody waited for. 2000 – [b]Red Alert 2[/b]. Made mostly by new members under [b]EA[/b], it rebooted the [b]RA[/b] series. Shared universe was no more. 2002 – [b]Renegade[/b]. Failed attempt to make next-gen mixture between RTS and FPS genres. 2003 – [b]Generals[/b]. The first game after the series' creators were shut down by [b]EA[/b]. Rather weird attempt to reboot series by dropping the old lore and altering core mechanics from [b]Dune II[/b]. 2007 – [b]C&C3[/b]. A pretty smart U-turn for the series that brought it back to its roots and felt a lot like remake of the 1995 game. 2008 – [b]Red Alert 3[/b]. A consoles-oriented game that felt more like [b]Generals 2[/b] and also introduced us to co-op. Thanks to which it felt more like online-oriented spin-off. Yet it was a very good game that lots of people loved. And [i]that[/i] was the beginning of the end.

How's the good game is a bad thing you may ask? You see, it made [b]EA[/b] believe that quick online sessions is what people wanted. You may expect them to learn from [b]Sole Survivor[/b]'s failure, but it was an ancient history, while at the moment [b]RA3[/b] was selling really well, so... Yeah. [b]C&C4[/b] was planned as a co-op-oriented project. Which... Isn't a bad thing per se. I mean, [b]RA3[/b] was good, right? Unfortunately, the fact that people swallowed [b]RA3[/b] being more [b]Generals[/b] than the original [b]C&C[/b], gave [b]EA[/b] another idea. An idea that... *SIGH* But OK, let's finally take a proper look at what we've got. And what we've got is... Anything but [b]C&C[/b].

I know, I know, it comes from a person who keeps saying that [b]Generals[/b] was not really [b]C&C[/b], but this here? It took every single [b]C&C[/b] element and flushed 'em down the toilet. Resource gathering? Believe it or not, it's no more. Remember the days we were arguing about [b]Generals[/b] having resource management similar to [b]WarCraft[/b] instead of our usual [b]Dune II[/b] thing? Well, resources are no more. No resources – no problem by [b]EA[/b] logic. Technically, [b]Tiberium[/b] ([b]C&C[/b]'s counterpart of [b]Spice[/b]) is still here, but it's just some crystals you'll be able to pick up now and then to upgrade units. Like I said, resource gathering? Not a thing. And so is a base building. Again, remember that old argument about how in [b]Generals[/b] we were able to build anywhere (similar to [b]WarCraft[/b] too), while “real” [b]C&C[/b] was all about the construction yard and things we were building around it? In this game we can't build at all. Well, technically, there [i]is[/i] one building. And the whole game revolves around it.

Everybody who played [b]C&C[/b] is familiar with the [b]MCV[/b]. So-called mobile construction vehicle was pretty much a portable construction yard. The original idea was to let us choose place for our new base to get the advantage we wanted. Now? Now it's more like our portable all-in-one base. Not only we can move it at any time ([b]StarCraft[/b] anyone?), it also acts like all other buildings from previous games. We build units, we purchase upgrades, we use powers... You've got the idea. Our whole base is just that – one fat [b]MCV[/b]. Where do we get money to produce units, you may ask? Well, that's a very good question, because in this game? You don't need money. You're free to build as many units as you want. There's a very strict population limit now, though, much more strict than in those [b]BLIZZARD[/b] titles. But that's just a thing. Forget about those big armies. Our goal in this game is, while only having a few units, to figure out perfect combination to outsmart our enemy.

But OK, you may say that simplified take on [b]Company of Heroes[/b], while not being a [b]C&C[/b] at all, may still be a good game. True. And that's where our second problem comes in. See, [b]C&C4[/b] is not a well-made product. Not even thought-through. The first thing you'll notice after the initial shock is... how hard this game is. Which... isn't even true. The problem is – single player campaign here is tied to your online profile. Remember the challenges from [b]RA3[/b] expansion? The ones, where you started with close to no technologies (units)? That's the stuff. You start single player campaign with nothing. Yet doing some skirmish grinding first will make it much easier. And a lot of grinding? You guessed it, there are no limits. Grind for the highest commander level (may take quite some time, especially since [b]GDI[/b] and [b]Nod[/b] are leveled separately) and get big advantage for your single player experience. What. The f*ck? Pretty sure single player experience implies dealing with properly calculated conditions. Here? It's a lot like playing story in some MMO. You stuck? Go grind somewhere else and come back later. Like I said, WTF?

Thankfully, most likely, you won't even get a chance to suffer through all that. Why? *SIGH* Did you play [b]Anthem[/b], guys? [b]C&C4[/b] was exactly that long before it. Starting [b]C&C4[/b] goes like this – launch the game, enter login and password for your [b]EA[/b] account, get an error, change password to fit eight symbols (don't ask me why) and voilà! The game works. Is it, though? Right after launch you'll be asked to enter login and password [i]again[/i]. Only this time even the short password won't help. Why? Because you need to have [b]EA[/b] app running on background. Again, don't ask me why (it doesn't look like the game interacts with it). Even after all that, there's still a chance for a game to tell you to go f*ck yourself. Hello, [b]Anthem[/b]. How you doin'?

So here we are. Not only this game dropped everything that we fell in love back in 1992, it also feels rushed (naturally, it's buggy and imbalanced too) and, well, it's half-broken. And it's all pretty sad, you know? The atmosphere here is quite solid. Moreover, the story is quite creative. It has FMV cutscenes, it's told from the first-person perspective and we, the commander, are the main character. The one who plays the most important role. We [i]finally[/i] got [b]Kane[/b] explained, there [i]is[/i] a proper ending for the [b]Tiberium[/b] saga... Sure, it's too short (game only has seven missions per faction), but still, with some proper gameplay, it'll be quite enjoyable. Unfortunately, [b]C&C4[/b] is a mixture of the unfortunate coincidences and bad decisions. When you look back, you see that such a mistake was inevitable. But it [i]is[/i] [b]EA[/b]'s fault that shot ended up being deadly. Dixi.","[h1][i]“Peace through powe... 💥”[/i]
~Kane[/h1]

So, overwhelmingly negative status, huh? You don't see that often. Also, it's a well-known fact that this game is a series killer. That's right. One of the most influential and important series for the RTS genre, the one that shaped and defined it the way we know it today was destroyed by this little fella here. How did that happen? To understand that we should first go for a quick summary.

1992 – [b]Dune II[/b] is released. Based on [b]David Lynch[/b]'s adaptation of [b]Frank Herbert[/b]'s novel, it introduced series' core gameplay. We were collecting [b]Spice[/b] with out harvester vehicles to earn credits and then spending those credits to build ourselves base and an army. 1995 – the first [b]C&C[/b] is made. While being spiritual successor of [b]Dune II[/b], the game had much more serious tone, while also including FMV elements. 1996 – [b]Red Alert[/b]. Pretty much the same thing with [b]C&C[/b], just with some improvements, naval battles [i]and[/i] an important backstory to [b]C&C[/b] villain – [b]Kane[/b], who was revealed as evil mastermind behind the humanity's major history events. 1997 – [b]Sole Survivor[/b]. Failed attempt for online-only deathmatch experience based on the original [b]C&C[/b] game.

1999 – [b]Tiberian Sun[/b]. The first game after [b]EA[/b] acquisition. Originally planned as much more complicated project, it ended up feeling a bit rushed, but still, in many ways it was a sequel everybody waited for. 2000 – [b]Red Alert 2[/b]. Made mostly by new members under [b]EA[/b], it rebooted the [b]RA[/b] series. Shared universe was no more. 2002 – [b]Renegade[/b]. Failed attempt to make next-gen mixture between RTS and FPS genres. 2003 – [b]Generals[/b]. The first game after the series' creators were shut down by [b]EA[/b]. Rather weird attempt to reboot series by dropping the old lore and altering core mechanics from [b]Dune II[/b]. 2007 – [b]C&C3[/b]. A pretty smart U-turn for the series that brought it back to its roots and felt a lot like remake of the 1995 game. 2008 – [b]Red Alert 3[/b]. A consoles-oriented game that felt more like [b]Generals 2[/b] and also introduced us to co-op. Thanks to which it felt more like online-oriented spin-off. Yet it was a very good game that lots of people loved. And [i]that[/i] was the beginning of the end.

How's the good game is a bad thing you may ask? You see, it made [b]EA[/b] believe that quick online sessions is what people wanted. You may expect them to learn from [b]Sole Survivor[/b]'s failure, but it was an ancient history, while at the moment [b]RA3[/b] was selling really well, so... Yeah. [b]C&C4[/b] was planned as a co-op-oriented project. Which... Isn't a bad thing per se. I mean, [b]RA3[/b] was good, right? Unfortunately, the fact that people swallowed [b]RA3[/b] being more [b]Generals[/b] than the original [b]C&C[/b], gave [b]EA[/b] another idea. An idea that... *SIGH* But OK, let's finally take a proper look at what we've got. And what we've got is... Anything but [b]C&C[/b].

Остання частина легендарної серії ігор, і цей факт робить усе моє та й більшості фанатів всесвіту Command & Conquer ще більш засмученими та кислими від досвіду проходження. Я й не буду дивуватися, що EA спеціально поховали надію на продовження у майбутньому та продовжили доїти більш прибуткові франшизи.

Почну зі сюжету. C&C не славилася своїми історіями та персонажами, але все одно вони привертали нашу увагу й нам було цікаво стежити за подальшими діями. Четвірка не дає ніякого чіткого розвитку всесвіту тіберія. Персонажі сірі та не відокремлюються від одне одного, навіть Кейн не може скерувати цю всю мішанину у правильне русло. Відсутні деталі та загально обізнані межі історії від завершення попередньої гри Kane's Wrath. Дані також не повернулися. А про скріннів взагалі мовчу - їх просто немає(тільки згадки), хоча величезний натяк на їх повернення був продемонстрований у кінці їхньої кампанії. 

Геймплей перетворився фундаментально й сам факт цього розізлив багатьох гравців, але на мою особисту думку проблема не в цьому, а в реалізації, Кульгає динаміка гри та гейм-дизайн місій разом зі картами й режимами звичайних матчей(а режим є тільки один - контроль точок). Не відчувається міць усіх юнітів та будівель, навіть бойові одиниці останього, третього рівня не показують страх на полі бою. Апогеєм розчарування стали культові робот ""Аватар"" та танк ""Мамонт"". Деякі війська мені здаються зовсім марними та не розумію нащо вони були створені(як сеймснік НОД) Присутність очків командування значно обмежує гравця та свідомо робить гру менш бажаною. Завдання, які нам даються впродовж проходження по сюжету, малоцікаві, а додаткові взагалі мають практично ніякого сенсу свого існування. Єдине необов'язкове доручення, яке було гідним виконання - це рятування полонених у місії. де ми ловимо Гідеона(""Нагорода за єресь""), а найцікавіше - вбивство снайпера(""Стікаючи кров'ю"").

Графіка приємна та не розчаровує, а дизайн юнітів є навіть іноді креативними. Саундтрек - єдина частина гри, яку можна та треба хвалити. Композитори не робили свою працю, плюючи на кінцевий результат.

У підсумку я скажу лише одне - мене поглинає смуток за цей фінал. Ставлю 4 з 10.

The last part of the legendary game series, and this fact makes me and most of the fans of Command & Conquer universe even more upset and sour from the experience of playing it. I will not be surprised that EA deliberately buried the hope for next part in the future in order to continue milking more profitable franchises.

Let's start with the plot. C&C was not famous for its stories and characters, but still they attracted our attention and we were interested in following further actions. The fourth one does not give any clear development of the Tiberium universe. The characters are gray and are inseparable from each other, even Kane cannot direct this whole mess that is plot into the right direction. There are no details and well-known plot points of the story from the end of the previous game - Kane's Wrath. Data also did not return. And I won't say anything about the Scrin - they are simply not there (only mentioned), although a huge hint of their return was demonstrated at the end of their campaign.

The gameplay has changed fundamentally and the very fact has angered many players, but in my personal opinion the problem is not in this, but in the implementation. The dynamics of the game and the game design of the missions are lame, along with the maps and gamemodes of regular skirmishes (and there is only one  - point control). The might of all units and buildings is not felt, even the combat troops of the last, third level do not show fear on the battlefield. The apogee of disappointment were the iconic robot ""Avatar"" and the tank ""Mammoth"". Some seem completely useless to me and I do not understand why they were created (like NOD's aftershock). The presence of command points significantly limits the player and deliberately makes the game less desirable. The tasks that are given to us during the walkthrough are of little interest, and the additional ones generally have practically no meaning of their existence. The only optional ones that were worthy of completion are rescue of prisoners in the mission. where we try to catch Gideon (""Heresy's Award""), and the most interesting one is where we kill the sniper (""Bleed Out"").

The graphics are nice and do not disappoint, and the unit designs are creative, sometimes. The soundtrack is the only part of the game that can and must be praised. The composers did care about the end result.

In the end, I will say only one thing - I am consumed by sorrow because of this end. I give it 4 out of 10.",

Das ganze Spielprinzipien mit diesen sogenannten Croller ist mal sowas von blöd man hat Offensiv, defensiv  und Support. will man zwischen diesen wechseln muss man den zu vorgebauten Croller immer zerstören. Da diese alle Gebäude in einen vereinen. Man hat keine Kraftwerke mehr oder Fahrzeugfabriken  einfach nichts. Man ist beschränkt was die Einheiten angeht usw. C&C Scharm ade !

This whole login mess is a disaster. The game doesn't even start when you install it from Steam. So I uninstalled it and reinstalled it via the EA app. But if you think it's starting now, you're mistaken. The EA app has to be open, and from there you have to start the game once and wait for the error message from the EA app. Close the error message and start the game from the desktop. Now the login works, for whatever reason... Once you're finally in the game, you think, ""Cool, I can play!"" Haha, but no, it would be too good to be true. You have to configure everything first, graphics, etc. Once that's done, you can finally start. But if you think it's like C&C 3, you'll be very disappointed. The whole gameplay system with these so-called scrollers is just so stupid. You have offense, defense, and support. If you want to switch between these, you always have to destroy the pre-built Croller, since it combines all the buildings into one. You no longer have power plants or vehicle factories, nothing at all. You're limited in terms of units, etc. Goodbye C&C charm!

The missions so far (8 hours) are very varied, and I'm constantly discovering new tactics.

Graphically very well done, and the maps make you want to explore instead of just wiping out the enemy and moving on – but the constant time pressure doesn't really allow for that.

Anyone who normally sends huge armies into battle has another reason to rethink their strategy, because you simply can't assemble them.

It definitely won't be able to recapture the good old days of ""Generals,"" but playing the story mode is a must.

终于知道为什么这代要叫王八战争了
第一点，GDI和nod的MCV移动起来确实挺像一个乌龟的，移动贼慢，而且陆行MCV还有四条腿
第二点，这代的战役需要经常换家换地点，甚至你有三种类型的MCV，属于乌龟换壳了
第三点，这代战役经常需要你那MCV充当人肉护盾，因为这代MCV实在太硬了，硬的就像乌龟

移动速度，坚硬程度，作息规律，还真就是个王八

如果不叫《命令与征服》的话，设计的其实挺有创意和点子的，跟前作无脑堆兵冲点不同，这代你需要占领各种据点，据点可以为你提供火力掩护，你需要经常的去占领对面的据点，然后把自己的MCV开过去驻扎在那从而做到自己的领地向前推进的效果，因为这代没有资源采集玩法，而且单位有数量限制，你只需要专注于指定推进计划，如何占领地盘并把自己的MCV向前推进就行

也是因为这点，游戏节奏真的被拖沓死了，在前作你可以做一个囤囤鼠，在攒够一大波兵力后猛冲对面老家非常有爽点，而这代因为单位限制和玩法思路的转变导致传统的CNC爽点荡然无存，值得一提的是这代的满编轰炸机依然很带劲，推起单位来效率依然很高

总的来说这是一部不那么传统的CNC，如果它不叫《命令与征服》我或许会对这款游戏有较高的评价，但很可惜本作的一些转变让它玩起来不是那么“传统”，其核心爽点也应设计思路的转变而丢失，很可惜它叫CNC！",

每次進遊戲也要登入EA帳號 2次, 間中登入會說錯誤/密碼錯誤(事實上沒有錯), 要登入多次才有機會連上, 才能進入遊戲, 但我只玩單人戰役而已, 不斷要我登入真的反感;
遊玩性也是差, 和紅3一樣繼承了 ""將軍"" 的bug, 而且還弄了指揮官升階系統, 不是""將軍""那個, 是像網遊/手遊那種, 你自己的帳號有階級提升, 而且又分為GDI和NOD 各自一個, 只有解鎖更多遊戲內的成就才能提升更快;
雖然不用收集資源徵兵, 但徵兵有限制50~60單位, 但每種兵一個皆個佔不同數量的單位, 這就導致一場可能只有十個兵就不能再徵兵, 即時戰略這樣玩真的是...
遊戲每場收集資源是用來開放自己能使用, 已解鎖的指揮官能力...
如果你想一開始就玩戰役困難到爆機, 敵人兵海、NOD敵人不斷佔領你的機器、任務目標, 皆會告訴你, 升級你的指揮官等級後再想吧...","The plot of this episode is completely terrible. In the earlier C&C episodes, Ken had a certain charisma, but in this episode, aside from the same appearance and name, it's like asking, ""Are you Ken's brother? Why are your personalities so different?"" I have to log in to my EA account twice every time I enter the game. Sometimes it says ""incorrect password"" (even though it's correct), and I have to log in multiple times before I can connect and enter the game. But I only play the single-player campaign, and constantly having to log in is really annoying. The gameplay is also poor. Like Red Alert 3, it inherits the bugs of ""Generals,"" and it even has a commander promotion system—not the ""Generals"" system, but more like an online/mobile game. Your account has rank progression, and it's divided into GDI and NOD, one for each. You can only progress faster by unlocking more in-game achievements. Although you don't need to collect resources to recruit troops, there's a limit of 50-60 units. Each type of troop occupies a different number of units, which means you might only have ten troops in a battle before you can't recruit any more. Playing real-time strategy like this is really... The resources you collect in each battle are used to unlock new commander abilities... If you want to jump straight into the campaign on the hardest difficulty, with hordes of enemy troops, NOD enemies constantly capturing your machines and mission objectives, it'll all tell you to upgrade your commander's level first..."

作为cnc系列官方所搞出来的正传，违背祖宗之法打改游戏玩法，取消了建筑系统，经济系统，加入了人口限制（大概是工t1步兵3，t1单位6，t3大型单位12，总人口50），让系列本来宏大的战斗场景不复存在。剧情更是逆天中的逆天。本来好端端的科技树硬是拆成3份（进攻型，防守型，支援型），让单人基本上很难达成步坦协同，陆空协同。然后作为结局作，最后决战更是一点感觉没做出来。

即使抛开cnc这个系列印象也是一坨，作为一个rts游戏居然单位靠指挥官等级解锁，而且gdi和nod等级分开算。初始只有t1的低级单位，战斗力低不说属性克制都凑不出来，本来以为对战里拿着t1单位去和t2t3打以及非常逆天了，结果连过战役的单位都要靠等级解锁，没有等级非常难办。（不过也不算特别难办，因为就连最后一关都能锁科技上限为t1）

不过单位的外形还是不错，为各种mod提供灵感思路，也算是为数不多的贡献吧。","The biggest problem is whether it even runs. Aside from that, other aspects are also unsatisfactory.

As the official mainline installment of the CNC series, it deviates from the established rules by drastically altering the gameplay. The building and economic systems were removed, and a population limit was added (roughly 3 T1 infantry, 6 T1 units, 12 T3 large units, totaling 50 population), destroying the series' original grand battle scenes. The storyline is even more outrageous. The perfectly good tech tree was split into three parts (offensive, defensive, and support), making it virtually impossible for a single player to achieve combined arms or air-ground coordination. And as the final installment, the final battle feels completely uninspired.

Even disregarding the CNC series, it's a mess. As an RTS game, units are unlocked based on commander level, and GDI and NOD levels are calculated separately. Initially, only T1 low-level units are available, resulting in low combat power and an inability to utilize elemental advantages. It was initially thought that using T1 units against T2 and T3 units in multiplayer would be incredibly powerful, but even campaign units require leveling up to unlock, making it very difficult without sufficient levels. (However, it's not exceptionally difficult, as even the final mission locks the technology cap at T1.)

The units' designs are quite good, providing inspiration for various mods, which is one of its few contributions."

Once you actually get it working you will be forced to log in not once but twice every time you launch the game, which will always be connected to the internet. I guess EA was worried that some people would pirate this masterpiece.

 When you actually start playing you will see that the gameplay does not resemble a C&C game whatsoever. No real base building or resource gathering. What do you think this is a C&C game or something? Well, it really does not feel like one at all. When I found out that this was originally an online only game made for the Asian market, which had a story attached to it to sell more copies during production. It all made more sense.
This brings me to the next point.

But Vogel, besides the gameplay C&C always had a fun story, Full motion video cutscenes, are those any good? The answer to that question my friends is a solid negative. The story feels like some lazy fanfiction that you would find on the internet. The cutscenes obviously have much lower production values compared to Tiberian Sun and C&C 3. Here is a good visual example of what I mean when I speak of lower production values.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=522954423

As I was watching these cutscenes I was wondering if Joseph Kucan (Kane) was thinking about the good old days when this franchise would feature Hollywood actors like Michael Ironside, J.K. Simmons, James Earl Jones, Billy Dee Williams and Ray Wise. I can't say I have heard of any of the actors who were cast for C&C 4 and frankly besides Joe Kucan,  most of them were not very memorable in this game. 
I like Joseph Kucan as an actor and I was always surprised that he did not have more roles in Hollywood movies, he would have been great as a villain in a James Bond movie during the Pierce Brosnan era, but I digress. It is just a shame that C&C 4 was the sendoff that a character as iconic in PC gaming as Kane and the C&C franchise got.

Some people would bring up the music as an example of something  good about this game but honestly, I thought it was trying too hard to sound ""epic"" and after a few hours of play I just wanted to turn it off. Especially the Nod soundtrack. Give me Frank Klepacki’s soundtrack for C&C 95 over this games soundtrack any day. Tracks like “Act on Instinct”, Remember the track that kicked off the whole C&C series? :)

Seriously unless you are a completionist like me and feel the need to play every C&C game, just avoid C&C 4 like a blue Tiberian field during an ion storm.","Saying C&C 4 is subpar is not news to longtime C&C fans, but after over a decade of pretending this game did not exist, I finally tried it.

Sure, it’s a departure from the classic C&C formula, but isn’t that what makes it unique? They ditched base-building and resource-gathering—yeah, it was bold—but the new Crawler system adds a fresh dynamic that keeps the gameplay moving. Instead of turtling in a base, you're constantly on the move, which makes things feel more tactical and tense. This constant forward momentum really changes the strategy in interesting ways, especially with the three distinct unit types: Offense, Defense, and Support. It really makes every battle feel different depending on which role you take on.

The story? Classic C&C drama. Kane’s back, GDI and Nod are still at each other’s throats, and there’s this whole apocalyptic vibe with Tiberium threatening to destroy Earth. I mean, it’s the end of the Tiberium saga! Sure, the cutscenes have less of that campy charm we loved from earlier games, but they still hit the mark for me. The narrative is darker, but fittingly so for a series finale.

As for the visuals, they might not pop as much as Red Alert 3, but come on, it’s still solid for a 2010 game. The unit designs are cool, especially the upgraded Nod Avatar walkers. People complain about the graphics, but hey, that’s hardly the point of a strategy game, right? It’s about the gameplay and that’s where C&C 4 shines in its own way.

Okay, I know the game has its quirks—logging in every time is annoying (especially when there are technical issues), and sure, the campaign can be a grind if you're not into the whole ""leveling up to unlock better units"" thing. But if you're patient, it’s totally worth it. The multiplayer and co-op are where this game thrives, offering some seriously fun moments once you get the hang of things.

All in all, Tiberian Twilight isn’t perfect, but it’s definitely not the trainwreck people make it out to be. If you’re a die-hard C&C fan, give it a shot with an open mind. It’s different, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing! It’s a refreshing twist on the formula and a great way to end a legendary saga.","Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight is such a misunderstood gem, I think it honestly gets way too much flak from the community.

精辟，实在精辟
提升级别——不升级你啥像样的东西都玩不到
泰伯利亚的史诗结局——直接一作把一个传奇RTS系列给埋了
------------------------------------
剧情怎么样暂且不谈。[spoiler] 给GDI打工，转正后就立刻死了老婆 [/spoiler]
只说遭遇战部分，取消掉经济运营和对抗，直接塔塔开和占点，然后通过强单位克制让玩家进行微操和调整部队编成，这套设计思路其实还挺有意思的。
但是将单位和升级解锁与等级直接挂钩的失败的逼肝机制真的毁了一切体验。等级不高你只能海低级兵造低级建筑，升级也没啥可点的东西，你的游戏体验是严重残疾的——劝退效果满分。
战役部分你能使用的单位同样跟这个等级系统绑定，而且制作组还自作聪明地加入了获取经验限制······进一步劝退。
所以对于想找个RTS游戏正常玩玩的玩家来说，本作不值得购买。如果你是想收集齐CNC系列、出于猎奇心态、打包买或者喜加一的话，倒是可以入一下——毕竟这游戏还能正常的启动和玩嘛（虽然不是每一次）","Level up to witness the epic ending of Tiberium Saga.
Brilliant, truly brilliant!
Level up—without leveling up, you can't play anything decent.
The epic ending of Tiberium Saga—it completely buried a legendary RTS series with one installment.

------------------------------------ Let's leave the plot aside for now. [spoiler] Worked for GDI, and his wife died immediately after he became a full member. [/spoiler] Just talking about the skirmish mode, removing economic management and combat, directly using tower defense and point capture, and then forcing players to micro-manage and adjust their unit composition through strong unit counters—this design concept is actually quite interesting.

However, the failed grind-driven mechanism of directly linking unit and upgrade unlocks to level completely ruins the experience. At a low level, you can only build low-level buildings with low-level units, and there's not much to upgrade, making your game experience severely crippled—a complete turn-off.

The units you can use in the campaign are also tied to this level system, and the developers cleverly added experience acquisition restrictions… further discouraging players.

Therefore, for players looking for a casual RTS game to play, this title isn't worth buying. However, if you're aiming to complete the CNC series, are just curious, want to buy it as a bundle, or are adding it to your library, then it might be worth considering—after all, the game can still be launched and played normally (though not every time)."

No se por que tuvieron la idea de innovar una nueva mecánica y para colmo gráficos menos que los red alert 3, no se siente satisfactorio en nada. Agradezcan que lo jugué mas de 1 hora por que la verdad no lo pensaba jugar, le había dado una oportunidad por respeto a la saga pero ni eso! no puedo! me mata! me saca años de vida este juego. 

Dentro de todo y perdón por mi vocabulario anterior pero se lo merecen por que le erraron bastante, almenos que hagan otro comand & conquer red alert 4 y bien hecho o que el 5 por favor logre tapar lo que el 4 no pudo brindar.

I'd even go so far as to say that Command & Conquer: Generals is far superior. They were doing so well with the series, and they completely ruined it with this latest release. I don't know why they decided to innovate a new mechanic, and to top it off, the graphics are worse than Red Alert 3. It's not satisfying in any way. Be grateful I played it for more than an hour because I honestly wasn't planning on. I gave it a chance out of respect for the series, but not even that! I can't! It kills me! This game takes years off my life.

All things considered, and excuse my previous language, but they deserve it because they really messed up. At least they should make another Command & Conquer: Red Alert 4, and do it right, or at least let Red Alert 5 manage to make up for what Red Alert 4 failed to deliver.

First off, how did the cut scenes go down in quality fro C&C3? I know the cut scenes were never anything better than a subpar B rated movie, but these are poorly designed even by Westwood standards.

Kane walks down a halway with nothing in his hands of in his coat, then pulls a basketball sized Teseract out of his pocket. From where?

After these steps, I logged into the game on Windows and played it for a bit.
Got curious if I do the same for Steam Deck, if it would work ? It did. I didn't do any of the launch options for Windows and it just worked. I have no explanation. If you are a steam deck user, just wanted to throw this idea out there so you can maybe have a fighting chance.

Here is the SteamOS launch option version change the executable folder to yours: gamemoderun mangohud ""/mnt/n_drive/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Command and Conquer 4 Tiberian Twilight/Data/CNC4.game"" -config ""../CNC4_English.SkuDef"" %command% 

These are copy pasted through the Steam Forums credit goes to MaxSixTux.
Some people say that they were able to get it working without this but sadly for me, all of the steps below had to be done. I like the C&C series and with the price this one has, normally I would recommend it but because its so broken and it might become completely unplayable really easily, I can't recommend it any shape or form.


--------------------
1) Went inside the C&C4 installation folder (where CNC4.exe is), and inside the compatibility tab, enabled the Administration mode for the executable.
2) Logged on inside ea.com with their account (not through Google account token or whatelse etc.) but with an account registered inside their servers. Changed the password in order to have just 8 characters and no special characters (like &%@ etc.)
3) Surfed on the net and found this website: https://gist.github.com/JeodC/cb7d632d1f20646defd0b2d180d43beb

Went in the ""Tiberian Twilight"" section and read what they wrote there. They stated that you have to go on Steam and put an start-up line:

cmd /c """"PATH-TO-GAMEFOLDER\Data\CNC4.game"" -config ""..\CNC4_English.SkuDef"" %COMMAND%

if you check, there two "" after /c. Leave them there, is not a typo. Change only the part ""PATH-TO-GAMEFOLDER"" with the path directory of C&C4 (if it contains spaces it doesnt matter). For example mine is: cmd /c """"E:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Command and Conquer 4 Tiberian Twilight\Data\CNC4.game"" -config ""..\CNC4_English.SkuDef"" %COMMAND%

Put the line inside the start-up command line inside Steam and double-check Steam got it right.

4) Launch the game. If everything is right, you should see a CMD prompt opening and the foreground window shrinking to 800x600. That's normal. The game will launch. THERE, you have to place the UserID (not the EA ID, the User ID that usually is an email address) and then the 8 character password. It should launch then login (like what happened to me). There's not much people connected, so it should work pretty smoothly.

5) Register a ""commander"" name and then continue with the main menu.

战斗模式大改到被称为“王八竞技场”的程度，当然现在都知道本作是衍生品转正，也不知道EA高管抽的什么风。我寻思CC系列EA可没少榨，页游手游都有，怎么非要把这玩意转正啊。导致本作单人赶工的不像话还要套个莫名其妙的升级机制，终局之后也没新东西玩，经典的EA游戏生命周期。
可惜的是在当年简化RTS或者RTS转MOBA大潮中本作算是不那么拍脑袋而且有可玩性的那种，三种类型的基地把步兵/建筑、装甲/战场拾捡、空中/指令技拆开，人口限制规模简化操作，单位建造只需要时间方便转型，胜利点和科研点（泰晶）的博弈，刚出那阵5V5玩起来还是挺有意思的，但没有后续的东西自然是凉了个透。值得一提的是本作的单位是系列里最情怀的，什么都往里丢，2的悬浮导弹、巨像、NOD的钻地都扔里了，反正衍生作不需要在乎设定。如果当成独立作品长线运营说不准能把CC系列整个全塞进去，不过EA的长线……哈。

剧情不会写可以不写，设定改的天翻地覆赖不到赶工上，完全是存心的。凯恩从枭雄便乘有家回不去的可怜思金人，等了几千年最后成功润回去，思金巨塔的开启效果居然变成了消灭地球上所有泰晶恢复生态？虽然思金设定是挺俗的但这让思金变成啥了？宇宙环保大使么？于是凯恩升天成了双赢。而由此产生的十万个疑问中最重要的一条显然是：这个让三次泰伯利亚战争以及参战方便乘小丑的鬼故事到底是怎么通过审核并且真拍出来的？这就是他们的史诗结局？和质量效应3一样史诗是罢，突然开始担心龙腾4仂。

让回忆停留在CC3吧。","This game is practically deserted, why doesn't EA just shut down the servers and make it purely single-player? Even now, you still need to log in to your EA account twice to get in.

The battle mode was drastically changed to the point of being called ""Turtle Arena."" Of course, everyone knows this game was a spin-off turned official, I don't know what got into EA executives. I think EA squeezed a lot out of the CC series, both browser and mobile games, why did they have to turn this thing into an official title? This resulted in the single-player mode being rushed and having a bizarre upgrade mechanism. There's nothing new to do after the endgame, classic EA game lifecycle.

Unfortunately, during the wave of simplified RTS or RTS-to-MOBA games at the time, this game was one of the less haphazard and more playable ones. The three base types separated infantry/buildings, armor/scavenging, and air/command skills; population limits simplified operations; unit construction only required time for easy transitions; the mechanics of victory points and research points (Taijin) made 5v5 quite fun when it first came out, but without any follow-up, it naturally flopped. It's worth mentioning that the units in this game are the most nostalgic in the series; they've thrown in everything imaginable—the hover missiles from Mass Effect 2, the Colossus, and the burrowing machines from Nod. After all, spin-offs don't need to worry about lore. If it were developed as a standalone long-term project, it might have even crammed the entire Critical Ops series into it, but EA's long-term strategy... haha.

If the plot is bad, they can leave it blank. The drastic changes to the lore can't be excused by rushing; it was intentional. Kane, from the Tyrant, rode the pitiful Siggin who couldn't return home, waited thousands of years, and finally succeeded in returning. The opening effect of the Siggin Tower somehow became the destruction of all Tiberium on Earth to restore the ecosystem? While the Siggin lore is quite cliché, what does this make the Siggin? A cosmic environmental ambassador? Thus, Kane's ascension becomes a win-win situation. And the most important of the ten thousand questions arising from this is: how did this ghost story of three Tiberium Wars and the use of the Joker for participation even pass censorship and actually get made into a film? Is this their epic ending? Epic like Mass Effect 3, huh? Suddenly, I'm starting to worry about Dragon Age 4.

Let the memories remain in CC3."

[h2] Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5) [/h2]



As a long-time fan of the Command & Conquer series, I approached Tiberian Twilight with a bit of trepidation, given the mixed reviews it received upon release. However, I was pleasantly surprised by what the game offers and found it to be a unique and engaging experience that deserves a positive nod.

Innovative Gameplay:
One of the most striking aspects of Tiberian Twilight is its shift away from the traditional base-building mechanics that defined earlier titles in the series. Instead, the game opts for a more dynamic, mobile approach to gameplay through the use of ‘Battlefield Commanders’ and a focus on unit-based strategies. This fresh take encourages players to adapt to the rapidly changing battlefield and think on their feet, which keeps the experience exhilarating and fast-paced.

Compelling Storyline:
The narrative in Tiberian Twilight ties up many loose threads from the Tiberium saga, providing closure to long-standing story arcs involving familiar characters. The voice acting and cutscenes are engaging and well-produced, immersing you in the conflict between GDI and Nod. It’s thrilling to see how the game integrates its lore into the gameplay, making decisions matter in the context of the overarching narrative.

Rich Multiplayer Experience:
The multiplayer component is another standout feature. With comprehensive co-op missions and competitive modes, the game brings a sense of community and competition that can be incredibly rewarding. Forming alliances and strategizing with friends adds layers to the gameplay, making it an ideal choice for those who enjoy team-based tactics.

Visuals and Sound:
On a technical note, Tiberian Twilight boasts impressive visuals for its time. The environments are detailed, and the unit designs are striking, reflecting the series’ signature aesthetic. Coupled with a robust soundtrack and sound effects, the game creates an immersive atmosphere that draws players into the conflict.

While Tiberian Twilight may depart from the classic C&C formula, it introduces innovative mechanics and a rich narrative that have left a lasting impression on me. If you’re open to new gameplay styles and appreciate a compelling story within the C&C universe, this title is worth diving into. It may not be perfect, but it certainly stands out as a worthy installment in the legendary franchise.

You have a unit cap with no worries about resources or gathering. Units have relatively similar response patterns when it comes to pathing to previous games, all while divided into rigid tiers. They can be upgraded and provide different responses, but are severely limited by a rock/paper/scissors system.

I would not recommend for a full playthrough. The entire Tiberium-based technology isn't used as an axis for developing either the artwork or the mech-technology seen in the artwork above. It's just mech and tank units for days. Fun for a while, but the initial limitations and hiccups make for a poor desire to return to play again.

However, its appearance as the final chapter of the main series is a grave mistake. The Tiberium story was originally very long and extensive, but it ended extremely hastily with this game. This, coupled with the already weakened state of the RTS genre, essentially sealed the fate of the entire Tiberium series with such a low-quality title. Therefore, the failure of this game has far-reaching and detrimental effects. DC Comics can reboot, and now, nearly 20 years later, hopefully Tiberium 4 can also be rebooted, removing the single-player story from this game before releasing a sequel."

Stattdessen bekommt man ein Spiel das ständig abstürzt oder mit steigender Anzahl von Objekten auf dem Spielfeld (nicht im Bild!) immer langsamer wird, bis es völlig unspielbar wird - auf einem System mit Ryzen 5800 X3D, Radeon RX 6900XT und 16GB RAM wohlgemerkt. Schon lange vorher fangen alle Texturen an zu flackern oder komplett zu verschwinden. Dann ist ein Neustart des letzten Savegames angesagt,

Das sich auch das Spielprinzip geändert hat, sollte sich schon herumgesprochen haben. Es gibt keinen Basisbau mehr und auch kein sammeln von Ressourcen. Das hätte dennoch Spaß machen können, wenn alles andere gepasst hätte.

Inhaltlich bietet C&C4 eine hauchdünne Story mit überwiegend einer einzigen Cut-Scene-Kulisse für GDI und NOD. Von den coolen Zwischensequenzen der Vorgängerspiele ist nichts mehr übrig. Man hat nicht mehr das Gefühl in einen globalen Konflikt um das Überleben der Menschheit involviert zu sein. Selbst die einzelnen Maps wirken wie ein beengter Sandkasten in dem man mit einigen wenigen Einheiten herumspielt.

Auch der Sound ist kaputt. Bei mir waren keine Kampfgeräusche zu hören. Keine Schüsse, keine Explosionen, nur Musik. Die Nod-Kampagne hat ein wenig mehr Charakter durch die atmosphärischere Musik, aber das kann auch nichts mehr retten.

Aktuell kann man das Spiel nicht mehr kaufen, sollte sich das aber wieder ändern: Es ist absolut rausgeschmissenes Geld!



","The grand finale of one of the most popular real-time strategy series, with its breathtaking graphics and satisfying conclusion to the story of GDI, the Brotherhood of Nod, and their leader Cain... is sadly not what Command & Conquer 4 (C&C4) promises.

Instead, you get a game that constantly crashes or slows down as the number of objects on the battlefield (not shown in the screenshot!) increases, until it becomes completely unplayable—and this is on a system with a Ryzen 5800 X3D, Radeon RX 6900XT, and 16GB of RAM, mind you. Long before that point, all the textures start flickering or disappearing completely. Then, restarting the last save game is the only option.

It should be common knowledge by now that the gameplay has also changed. There's no more base building or resource gathering. That could have been fun, though, if everything else had been right.

In terms of content, C&C4 offers a wafer-thin story consisting mostly of a single cutscene setting for GDI and Nod. The cool cutscenes of the previous games are completely gone. You no longer feel involved in a global conflict for the survival of humanity. Even the individual maps feel like cramped sandboxes where you just mess around with a few units.

The sound is also broken. I couldn't hear any combat sounds. No gunfire, no explosions, just music. The Nod campaign has a little more character thanks to its more atmospheric music, but that can't salvage the game.

Currently, the game is no longer available for purchase, but if that changes: it's an absolute waste of money!

Because you cant play your own game offline. What if your internet goes out or you cant afford to keep paying ISP and want to save some money? You wont even have access to your own game. And its insane because its old !

It has SOLO MODES....

You cant even see options for Resolution monitor settings until you have a EA account !

1st try to use your Current active EA
account. 

Because you have to use the same Email and Password anyway. So 
Don't make a new account or password if you have a EA client account already. 

Once in, you can bring all the graphics up to acceptable levels.
There is good graphic details to the game models once you up the resolution to max. 
Then the graphics appear to be quality.

In the lobby you will find only a handful of player names:
And no one will respond to you. Probably died at their computer :(

Your best bet is organize a game on DISCORD find some C&C servers there. Discord  desktop app web app or cell phone your preference. And first google some Tiberian Twilight discord servers you can find people and organizing matches with perhaps. 

I suggest Don't buy this game. Not even for the D L C Unless you always have internet access.  
If for the near future always have Internet, then by all means get it if you want.

For starters, to start *enjoying* this, you need to login with your Origin or whatever EA has to this day, twice, first in launcher, then ingame. Next up, you'll be met with music and cinematics whose tone doesn't match previous CnC games at all but does match the EA's executives at the time ideas of what people would like, the faction conflict of GDI and Nod is being diluted by personal drama of main character who gets to loose a wife that previously showed up for ten seconds but she's a woman saying a nice thing in your face so I guess gamers will forever remember her, and then troopers you serve with get pretty emotional too except the actors aren't the best at it so it comes off goofy and pathosy, and the forst first person perspective with neural network UIs is just over the top with it's flashyness. The art direction in particular seems very influenced by at that time EA's most successful Mass Effect series, you can see it in UI in particular. Music is also way more orchestral and pompastic than anything ever delivered by Frank Klepacki.

Now, the gameplay, it gets a lot of hate. I must say, but as a team-based, online RTS with focus on dynamic shift of frontlines and no preset bases it's kinda sound, conceptually, plus three distinct types of ""crawlers"" the mobile bases in a single unit, with one being able to push trough with best armored unit, another getting to deploy defenses and infantry that can garrison structures, and yet third getting mostly aerial units and special abilities. It feels kinda like a sci-fi take on World in Conflict, more gamey, but with defined player roles and sides constantly harassing and pressuring each-other. Problem is, the online scene never lasted with how badly this game was received, there's this absolutely insulting grinfingg mechanic where you need to complete missions, skirmishes or online battles to unlock new units, not as some alternative loadouts but as part of core progress, demanding many more games to be played than just going trough a campaign, and all unified for both online and single play, and finally, this gameplay just doesn't translate to as very enjoyable experience in singleplayer, you get to have a small, very modest array of like 8 to 16 combat units at a time, there's some situational additions like husks of wrecked heavy units like in CnC4 to capture if you can afford engineers for it, but ultimately you're just pumping samey units and treating it all like some micro-intensive small squad breaktrough thing even though your units don't have any micro-intensive abilities or benefit from taking cover or something, plus unless necessity dictates you need to defend a single point or need to cover impassable terran with aerial units, you'll be playing all missions with Offensive crawler, so you won't use the free occupyable structures the game has, nor will you be using special ability most of time - and since you'll often deal with more numerous enemy forces that replenish as fast as you, it usually all boils down to building the exact units that counter enemy's forces, collecting veterancy upgrades dropped by enemies, and keep pumping reinforcements while hoping you can hold up. Even repairs don't feel worth it when performed by your easy to destroy engineers, takes too long, so you're better off ordering new units that microing back for repairs, and let me tell you clicking one or two unit buttons endless is a downgrade for CC, going way back to tank spam days.

And going back to presentation, I must say levels look pretty nice, the supermassive industrial construction sites and futuristic green cities make for nice arenas, but the structures and units you get? They range from way more toyetic takes on something you've seen in CnC3 or even earlier games, to genuinely embarrassing, goofy designs. The developers had to even replace the pre-release Nod engineer because it looked like a goofy cartoon worm with a jetpack - and yet, many other designs in this one could have used similar reworks back in the day. And the story? Yeah, Command and Conquer cinematics always felt cheap and hard to take seriously but this one really feels like a new low with team just filming ""citizen interviews"" with dev team members on streets of LA, blatantly modern day LA without a single postprocessed-in thing all while ingame cities look radically different from modern urban environments. Oh and the very last cinematic is just a white void.

People say this one killed the CnC series and harmed the RTS as a genre for years. I agree. I don't think it's worth your time, if you grabbed the CnC collection you should have a whole load of great games, don't hesitate to pass on this one even if you're a true penny pincher.","This was loathed on release and where some games actually redeem themselves with time and effort or just don't feel as controversial in retrospective, this one still sucks, to this day.

C&C has some of the most iconic RTS titles of all time. This, sadly, is not one of them.

C&C 4 took everything great about the series and just sort of tossed it aside and went in a completely different direction. Instead of building a traditional base, you have this strange mobile command vehicle, where you recruit all your units and do everything. It's sort of like an all-in-one base. And BOY is it not fun at all. A big part of RTS games is building a base and managing your resources, but this game is like ""nah, we don't need that.""

Furthermore, there's also no resource gathering. You just gradually earn points that allow you to recruit more units. The unit limit, by the way, is incredibly low. This game seems to want you to micromanage just a few units, which I don't personally find nearly as fun. This also means, that there's no ""worker"" or ""harvester"" unit, and there's no way to attack your opponent's economy, other than gradually taking control of the map to earn your points faster.

If this had been a standalone game, people might have been mildly interested. But calling this abomination a ""Command & Conquer"" game was just a giant slap in the face to fans. You want to play Street Fighter with no punching? How about Super Mario Brothers with no jumping? That's what this game feels like to people who love the series.

Here's my limited impression of Tiberian Twilight: (In Short) Forgettable and not worth remastering, way too easy to retcon the whole damn thing...

Otherwise, if you're thinking about about buying this lemon as a standalone purchase (assuming you can)...  DON'T!

Okay, after completing the first login step, you'll enter the game. However, the game will force you to log in again. Here's the problem: you absolutely cannot log in again. Why?

Sì, ammetto che anche io avrei preferito che questo capitolo avesse avuto il classico gameplay RTS come i precedenti Tiberium Wars e Kane's Wrath, ma complessivamente mi piace. Il gioco è molto incentrato sulla cooperazione e si basa su un concetto di 'azione/controllo' in cui si sceglie il proprio ruolo sul campo di battaglia (attacco, difesa o supporto). Un concetto che probabilmente, nel 2010, era ancora nuovo e poco concepito. Il Tiberium è sempre presente, anche se qui non è la risorsa usata per costruire le unità, ma serve per acquistare i relativi potenziamenti. Personalmente, lo consiglio.","Despite the overwhelmingly negative reviews for this game, I decided to buy it anyway and realized it's not as bad as (almost) everyone says. Yes, I admit that I too would have preferred this installment to have had the classic RTS gameplay like the previous titles, Tiberium Wars and Kane's Wrath, but overall I like it. The game is heavily focused on cooperation and is based on an action/control concept where you choose your role on the battlefield (offense, defense, or support). A concept that was probably still new and poorly conceived in 2010. Tiberium is always present, even though here it isn't the resource used to build units, but is used to purchase their upgrades.

En primer lugar, el estilo de juego ha cambiado totalmente, ya no es un RTS clasico de construir tu base y dessarollar tus tecnologías, sinó que vas con un solo edificio y sacas unidades desde allí. Además, ya no hay ""campos de Tiberio"", de hecho ni siquiera hay recursos, las unidades son gratuitas. 

En segundo lugar, hay poquísimas opciones a la hora de hacer estrategias variadas, solo hay creo; unas 11 unidades. Además, (aunque esto sea quizás cosa mía) la interfaz a la hora de hacer una escaramuza, no se entiende muy bien, oséase: no sé como cambiar la facción y otras cosas varias.

En tercer lugar: el juego no está en Español, aunque cierto es que eso quizá haya que mirarselo en la configuración. Yo lo he mirado muy por encima y no he descubierto nada relacionado con el idioma.

En cuarto y último lugar: necesitas crearte un perfil de E.A. para jugar, pero a mí al menos, me ha dado muchísimos problemas, en el sentido de que daba un error extraño cuando iniciaba sesión, estando bien la contraseña y el nombre de usuario. Es más, de los 28 minutos que sale que he jugado, 7 son porque mientras intentas iniciar sesión te cuenta tiempo de juego.

Conclusión: no te lo compres a menos que te cueste menos de 000,00 euros, y aunque así sea, dudo que lo vayas a jugar más de 20 minutos, como yo y las pobres millones de almas perdidas que compraron esto pensando que era un C&C solo por el título.

Add to that the pop-up errors and login failures, and my blood pressure is off the charts after completing the GDI mission. The in-game stuff is even worse. Legitimate players are victims. Seriously, don't play the legitimate version; EA's experience is just awful. You can't even get a T3 unit after your first playthrough of the main story.

And then there's the unit design. What were you thinking, putting a machine gun on the chassis of the Predator 3 and creating a complete waste? And that Bulldog, what's with the candy-shooting machine?

The Titan's damage is ridiculous. The worst part is you have to find blue chests to get a unit at full health. Damn it!

Худшее завершение культовой франшизы и придумать сложно. Осталось всего две стороны конфликта, три МСЦ (оборонительный, наступательный и поддержка) для производства войск и горстка юнитов на карте, поскольку теперь появился лимит. Графика стала хуже, звуковая составляющая тоже. Сюжет шит белыми нитками, количество миссий слишком скудное, дизайн карт и юнитов безыдейный, безвкусный и не вписывается в общий лор вселенной. К тому же типы войск не соответствуют пилотам, сидящим внутри, а общие размеры машин огневой мощи. Ресурсы теперь добывать не надо, лишь удерживать точки интереса, прямо как в Company of Heroes. Зеленые и красные кристаллы тиберия подбираются только в специально отведенных местах и нужны для прокачки характеристик юнитов. Даже Джо Кукан в лице любимого всеми Нодовцами Кейна не вытягивает своей харизмой проект.
Это очень примерный образец того, что если маркетологи берутся за что-либо, то получается пятикратно переваренная субстанция. Поэтому можно сказать, что финал истории открыт, ибо эта часть неканон.

It's hard to imagine a worse ending to the iconic franchise. There are only two sides to the conflict, three MSCs (defensive, offensive, and support) for troop production, and a handful of units on the map, thanks to a new limit. The graphics have deteriorated, as have the sound. The plot is thinly woven, the number of missions is too meager, the map and unit designs are bland, tasteless, and out of sync with the overall lore of the universe. Furthermore, the troop types don't correspond to the pilots inside, and the overall size of the vehicles doesn't match the firepower. Resources no longer need to be mined, only points of interest need to be held, just like in Company of Heroes. Green and red Tiberium crystals are collected only in designated locations and are needed to upgrade unit stats. Even Joe Kukan, played by Kane, beloved by all Nodovites, can't carry the project with his charisma.

This is a prime example of how, when marketers take on something, the result is a substance that's been overcooked five times over. Therefore, one could say the story's ending is open-ended, as this part is non-canon.
It's worth picking up only for the sake of placing this example in the player's chamber!

P.S. For the glory of Kane!"

В этой игре плохо абсолютно всё.

Сюжет плох. От третьей части идёт абсолютно нелогичный скачок, зачем-то вставили бесполезную любовную линию. Кейн потерял харизму, на видеовставках тоже видно экономили. Сюжет начинается с ничего и заканчивается максимально вяло.

От игрового процесса тянет закрыть игру поскорее. Строительства баз нет, добычи ресурсов нет. Теперь это МОБА. После шедевральной третьей части и дополнения к ней это выглядит как плевок в душу. От скриннов есть только упоминания в сюжете, играбельную фракцию выкинули на помойку.

Графически игра тоже стала хуже. Стилистика третьей части потрясающая, и когда включаешь после неё четвёртую, задаёшься вопросом, а это вообще та серия игр?

В общем, в этой игре абсолютно ничего не стоит внимания, сюжет проще посмотреть в записи за 15-20 минут. Ради геймплея играть в это точно не надо.","It was disgusting. I finished one campaign in four hours. I watched the second storyline on YouTube.

Everything about this game is absolutely bad.

The plot is bad. The jump from the third game is completely illogical, and they somehow inserted a useless love story. Kane has lost his charisma, and they clearly skimped on the cutscenes. The plot starts with nothing and ends in a completely sluggish manner.

The gameplay makes you want to close the game as soon as possible. There's no base building, no resource gathering. It's a MOBA now. After the masterpiece of the third game and its expansion, this feels like a slap in the face. The screenshots are only mentioned in the story, and the playable faction has been thrown out.

The game's graphics have also gotten worse. The style of the third game is stunning, and when you play the fourth game after it, you wonder, is this even the same game series?

Overall, there's absolutely nothing worth paying attention to in this game; the story is easier to watch in a recording in 15-20 minutes. You definitely shouldn't play it for the gameplay."

Sem bases onde um MCV se resume em tudo, não podendo acelerar a construção de unidades sendo um fator importante para repor as tropas principalmente na campanha;
Não tem recursos para coletar, pode treinar a vontade desde que tenha células populacionais, e uns cristais de tiberium espalhados pelo mapa, só se pega isso algumas vezes para melhorar as unidades...
Tropas muito limitadas no fator quantidade, ai eu me pergunto como passo uma fase em que tenho no máximo 15 unidades contra 4x mais do inimigo, é uma missão inicial ainda então resumindo não tem muita coisa para treinar ou melhorar... Infelizmente desbalanceado;
Não gostaria de dizer isso sobre o game mas para mim é um jogo bem fora de C&C e ruim também, é jogável mas tem momentos que irritam o jogador...
Se você quer um C&C bom que tenha bons gráficos com certeza é o C&C 3 de longe o melhor nesse caso, ou até mesmo vale a pena tentar os clássicos também muito bons mesmo, até o C&C 2 que ficou dividido entre amor e ódio...
Meu amigo C&C 4 foi o pior que já joguei, no caso se enjoar de todos o C&C aí sim jogue esse pois encontrará um experiencia diferente que para mim foi estranha e desagradável, mas pelo menos é algo diferente para tentar aliviar a mente das batalhas frenéticas dos outros jogos da franquia!","I was surprised by what I found, which wasn't very positive, very different from what you usually find in Command & Conquer...

Without bases where a MCV (Multiple Lifecycle) system is everything, you can't accelerate the construction of units, which is an important factor in replenishing troops, especially in the campaign;
There are no resources to collect, you can train as much as you want as long as you have population cells, and some tiberium crystals scattered around the map, you only get these a few times to improve the units...
Troops are very limited in terms of quantity, so I wonder how I get through a level where I have a maximum of 15 units against 4 times more of the enemy, it's still an initial mission so in short there's not much to train or improve... Unfortunately unbalanced;

I wouldn't like to say this about the game, but for me it's a game that's very different from C&C and bad too. It's playable, but there are moments that irritate the player...
If you want a good C&C game with good graphics, C&C 3 is definitely the best in that case, or it's even worth trying the classics, which are also very good, even C&C 2, which was divided between love and hate...
My friend, C&C 4 was the worst I've ever played.

Como secuela y epílogo de la saga Tiberian puede resultar decepcionante, pero como juego en sí mismo es medianamente pasable y entretenido. A título personal, está lejos de ser el desastre que la crítica general apuntó allá en el 2010, año en el que se estrenó. 

El principal problema -si exceptuamos las comparaciones con otros juegos de la misma saga- radica en que 
replantea todo su sistema jugable que tradicionalmente consistió en gestión de bases de combate y unidades a favor de un sistema orientado al multijugador -no hay control de bases, solo un número limitado de unidades y un sistema de puntos-, así como defensa y conquista de torres. La jugabilidad que plantea es cómoda, más o menos se aprende rápido pero carece de profundidad porque apenas deja al jugador opciones para enfrentarse a los desafíos. El tono es lineal y de escasa maniobra. Es decir, es un título de estrategia RTS pero sin estrategia, solo dejando la parte de acción.

A día de hoy los pocos alicientes que un jugador puede encontrar para jugarlo es... la campaña, el modo historia porque el multijugador está poco más que muerto. Si eres fan de la saga Command and Conquer vale la pena jugarlo -aunque genere sentimientos encontrados-. Su modo historia tiene un planteamiento interesante -dramático, seria y con cierto carácter épico-; el gran inconveniente es su escasa duración y la falta de un mayor desarrollo. 

Un último apunte, solo necesitas introducir tu cuenta de EA/Origin para iniciar el juego -puede surgir algún error de inicio pero se solventa fácilmente volviendo a introducir los datos o esperando un rato-. 

Recomendado para el fan de la saga Command and Conquer. Por lo demás, un título pasable y jugabilidad anecdótica.","Tiberian Twilight is a title with both strengths and weaknesses. As a sequel and epilogue to the Tiberian saga, it may be disappointing, but as a standalone game, it's moderately passable and entertaining. Personally, I think it's far from the disaster that critics generally labeled it back in 2010, the year of its release.

The main problem—if we disregard comparisons with other games in the same series—lies in the fact that it completely redesigns its gameplay system, which traditionally consisted of managing combat bases and units, in favor of a multiplayer-oriented system—there's no base control, only a limited number of units and a point system—as well as tower defense and conquest. The gameplay it offers is comfortable and relatively quick to learn, but it lacks depth because it barely gives the player options for facing challenges. The tone is linear and offers little room for maneuvering. In other words, it's an RTS strategy title without strategy, focusing solely on the action.

Currently, the few incentives a player can find to play it are... the campaign and the story mode, because the multiplayer is practically dead. If you're a fan of the Command and Conquer saga, it's worth playing—even if it evokes mixed feelings. Its story mode has an interesting premise—dramatic, serious, and with a certain epic feel; the major drawback is its short length and lack of further development.

One last point: you only need to enter your EA/Origin account to start the game—you might encounter a startup error, but it's easily resolved by re-entering the information or waiting a while.

Recommended for fans of the Command and Conquer saga. Otherwise, it's a passable title with unremarkable gameplay."

This is basically a mobile game on PC. If it WERE on mobile, I actually think it might've been decently liked, with more of its flaws overlooked in favor of accessibility.

Most other reviews are tinged with disappointment at what this game represents in the series, but very little as to what the game actually is. There are definitely much worse games out there, and I still squeezed some hours out of this one, it's just not a very memorable game either.

This is basically a mobile game on PC. If it WERE on mobile, I actually think it might've been decently liked, with more of its flaws overlooked in favor of accessibility.

Most other reviews are tinged with disappointment at what this game represents in the series, but very little as to what the game actually is. There are definitely much worse games out there, and I still squeezed some hours out of this one, it's just not a very memorable game either. I'm only giving it a positive because it's cheap, but it's tenuous considering you have to jump some hoops to even make this emblem of mediocrity playable."

Man hat den Eindruck, eine halbherzige Mod für Warcraft 3 zu spielen.

Das Gameplay ist völlig verändert und nicht einmal mehr im Ansatz mit dem der vorherigen Teile zu vergleichen. Man fühlt sich an einfache Handyspiele erinnert. 

Desweiteren wird die wirre Story, die man in Tiberian Sun begonnen hat, konsequent schlecht und unnötig umfangreich (also von der Videolänge her, nicht inhaltlich) weitergesponnen. 

EA sollte dringend einen Idiotentest für Manager einführen. Mir ist völlig unverständlich, wie solch ein miserables Laienwerk durch die Qualitätskontrolle kommt.","Command & Conquer 4 doesn't live up to its bad reputation—it's even worse!

【注意事项】
1.外部启动器依然需要登录你的EA账号
2.离线补丁会修改系统hosts文件，如需恢复联网功能，请清空hosts文件
3.本作解锁单位需要经验，account.xml里可修改经验值，改大可解锁所有单位。但数值不能太大，否则无法进入游戏（此时改小即可）
4.请使用存档/读档功能，因为离线补丁会让关卡进度无法保存到EA服务器上，你只有读档才能接着上次的进度继续玩。

【修改器】

Right-click on the game in your Steam library, select Properties, change the language to ""Traditional Chinese,"" and wait for the download to complete (if the download fails, try a US server).

2. Download Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight from 3DM. Traditional Chinese Offline Crack Patch

3. Run the patch as administrator (right-click) and install it to the game's main directory.

4. Right-click the game in your Steam library, select Properties, verify the integrity of the game, and wait for the download to complete.

5. Open the game's main directory and run CNC4SERVER.exe (do not close this program while playing).

6. Log in to the game using the account located in your main directory/Accounts/email/account.xml (external launchers still require you to log in with your legitimate EA account).

7. In the game, check the following settings: Options/General/Show Subtitles

【Notes】
1. External launchers still require you to log in with your EA account.

2. The offline patch will modify the system hosts file. To restore network connectivity, please clear the hosts file.

3. Unlocking units in this game requires experience. You can modify the experience value in account.xml; increasing it will unlock all units. However, the value cannot be too large, otherwise you will not be able to enter the game (you can reduce it to a smaller value).

4. Please use the save/load function, because the offline patch will prevent your level progress from being saved to EA's servers. You can only continue playing from where you left off by loading a save file.

*!-Wichtig-!* für den Ingame-Login, hier herrschen Unterschiede zu den heutigen Passwortrichtlinien  von EA!

Man braucht ein EA-Konto zum spielen, was eigentlich nicht erklärt werden muss. Benutzt dazu ein Passwort mit mindestens 8 Zeichen (aber nicht länger als 24 Zeichen), Groß- u. Kleinbuchstaben, eine Zahl und ein Sonderzeichen. Ich musste mein komplexeres längeres Passwort anpassen, da ich damit auch nicht ins Spiel kam. Viele schreiben hier, dass man nicht mehr auf den EA-Server kommen würde, aber wenn man das mit den Passwort beachtet, sollte es reibungslos mit dem einloggen klappen.

Mir persönlich macht der vierte Teil von C&C keinen großen Spaß. Hier wollte man wohl damals das Spiel für E-Sports Events anpassen, was nicht sonderlich gut funktionierte. Kein echter Basenbau mehr, sondern mobile fliegende Bauhöfe, hektischeres Gameplay und strategische Kartenpunkte die man zeitlich mit Einheiten besetzen muss. Das seltsame Skillsystem passt auch nicht wirklich in die Reihe. Ein absoluter Bruch mit der ursprünglichen C&C - Formel.

Wenn man das C&C-Bundle erworben hat, ist es halt dabei. Von einem Einzelkauf dieses Titels würde ich persönlich auf jeden Fall abraten, auch wenn Kane eine coole durchgeknallte Socke ist.","You need an EA account to play.

*Important!* for in-game login: there are differences compared to EA's current password guidelines!

You need an EA account to play, which shouldn't need explaining. Use a password with at least 8 characters (but no longer than 24 characters), uppercase and lowercase letters, a number, and a special character. I had to change my more complex, longer password because I couldn't get into the game with it. Many people are saying they can no longer access the EA servers, but if you follow the password guidelines, logging in should work smoothly.

Personally, I'm not enjoying the fourth installment of C&C very much. It seems they wanted to adapt the game for e-sports events, which didn't work very well. There's no more real base building; instead, there are mobile flying construction yards, more hectic gameplay, and strategic map points that you have to occupy with units within a time limit. The strange skill system doesn't really fit the series either. A complete departure from the original C&C formula.

If you've purchased the C&C bundle, it's included. I would definitely advise against buying this title separately, even though Kane is a cool, crazy guy."

And then there's this awful single-player mode where you're the only one allowed to fight against two crawlers (construction yards). Even on Easy difficulty, it's not easy.

Der Sarg Nagel der Command & Conquer Reihe...  Jeder Billige abklatsch wäre besser als dieses Spiel,

Der Erste Grund ist der Online Zwang.. beim starten muss man einen Account haben bei EA und sich  einloggen, aber nein nach dem starten Direkt nochmal einloggen und Passwort eingeben bevor man ins Hauptmenü Kommt.. Welcher Geistesgestörte Vollidiot hat sich  so ein scheiß ausgedacht???? Der müsste sofort ein Berufsverbot bekommen.
Als wenn das nicht schon Schlimm genug wäre, Bricht das Spiel Sofort ab wenn auch nur eine Sekunde mal das Internet abbricht, und schon darf man sich  wieder neu Einloggen..... Das Ist das Aller Letzte....

Zum Spiel Selber der Basis Bau wurde abgeschafft und es gibt ein Radikales Einheiten Limmit, Also Das Kern und Herz Stück der Reihe wurde einfach Herausgerissen,.  Dieses Spiel ist überhaupt eine Schande, Es Ist eine Schande das es überhaupt Command & Conquer heißen darf. Es Hat diesen namen nicht verdient,
Warum Hat man Nicht Lieber  C&C Generals 2 Gemacht den Generals ist eine meiner Lieblings Teile mit Alarmstufe Ror 2 und 3.

Hätte man dieses Furchtbare Spiel gleich im Keim erstickt gäbe es heute vllt noch  Die Command & Conquer Serie, aber mit dieser Schande wurde Die Reihe Begraben.

Die Story ist mega Platt und Langweilig das Ganze Spiel Prinzip macht keinen Spaß da man weder Gebäude Bauen kann noch viele Einheiten.

Ich Kann nur abraten dieses Stück Schande der Geschichte zu Kaufen....

Ich Hoffe  sehr das nach dem Remastert der ersten Beiden teile auch  weitere Folgen vor allem Tiberium Sun - Renegade und Alarmstufe Rot 2 und ganz Wichtig Generals mit Stunde Null....... 

An Die Entwickler dieses Spiels Schämt euch das ihr so etwas überhaupt auf den Markt gebracht habt und dafür auch noch Geld verlangt... Selbst als Geschenk ist dieser Teil eine Bestrafung...     Wascht euch rein und macht endlich  wieder gute Teile und Remakes der Alten Reihe, dann bekommt die Reihe Hoffentlich  wieder neuen Aufschwung.
Mir Blutet bei diesem Spiel wirklich  das Herz :-( Ich trauere heute noch um das Geld was ich  Damals zu Release dafür ausgab.....","I've been the biggest C&C fan since the series began, but this installment is the absolute worst... The final nail in the coffin of the Command & Conquer series... Any cheap knock-off would be better than this game.

The first reason is the online requirement. You have to have an EA account and log in to start the game, but no, after starting, you have to log in again and enter your password before you even get to the main menu. What kind of mentally deranged idiot came up with this crap?! They should be banned from the industry immediately.

As if that weren't bad enough, the game crashes immediately if the internet connection drops for even a second, and then you have to log in again... This is the absolute worst...

As for the game itself, base building has been removed, and there's a radical unit limit. The core and heart of the series has simply been ripped out. This game is a disgrace. It's a disgrace that it's even allowed to be called Command & Conquer. It doesn't deserve this name.

Why didn't they make C&C Generals 2 instead? Generals is one of my favorite installments, along with Alert 2 and 3.

If this terrible game had been nipped in the bud, the Command & Conquer series might still exist today, but this disgrace buried the franchise.

The story is incredibly flat and boring, and the entire gameplay is no fun since you can't build buildings or command many units.
























... I strongly advise against buying this piece of historical disgrace....

I sincerely hope that after the remastering of the first two installments, further installments will be released, especially Tiberium Sun - Renegade and Red Alert 2, and most importantly, Generals with Zero Hour.......

To the developers of this game: Shame on you for even releasing something like this and charging money for it... Even as a gift, this installment is a punishment...

Quick history about this title: This game was supposed to be a C&C game originally tailored for the Asian market, sort of a spin-off sorts with fast-paced battles and persistent online. However, in EA's infinite wisdom decided to make this into the next mainline entry to C&C and you can clearly see how that turned out.

First, the bad: Biggest one, there is no base building. Absolute heresy to me considering this is a C&C title, even their last big title Red Alert 3 stuck to the ways of the MCV! 

Second, the always online requirement. You need to be online to play this game, even in single player missions. This to me makes no sense if you do not intend to play multiplayer as when the servers eventually go offline, you have no way to play this game! 

Third, the intended design of this game. This game is heavily reliant on rush tactics, even if you play defense class. Since your MCV is the only major building you have to take care of, turtling tactics are not an option.. Plus, there's a unit cap which is also silly in a C&C game. 

Fourth, the storyline. Oh boy, did they screw this one up bad. Not spoiling anything but this game ignores a major plot point in C&C 3 which completely changes how the story progresses. Honestly, only the cutscenes with Kane are the only thing that saves this from being utterly forgettable, but even then it feels like the whole thing was rushed.

There are some good things I can say about this game. Firstly, the music. While not appropriate for a C&C game (lots of orchestral music), it does provide some semblance of competency for each track composed.

Second, the graphics. Ignoring the downgraded sound design (which seems to be lacking from C&C 3), the graphics do have the visual flair from what I assume is an upgraded engine from what EA has been using from Red Alert 3 and C&C 3. There seems to be some effort to really step up the graphics from all the previous games, shame that it's basically squandered here.

There is a reason a lot of fans consider C&C 4 to not be the conclusive ending to this great series and I do not recommend you go out of your way to play this game unless you're willing to deal with the always-online requirement and a sub-par storyline. Multiplayer may be fun at times if you know what to expect, but there are way better games that do this kind of gameplay. Unless you're here because of the bundle for all the other C&C games then in that case, understandable.","Ah yes, the much maligned final main entry to the Command and Conquer series that started from 1995.

EA, es ist schön das ihr die Alten Spiele wieder auf den markt direkt in Steam bringt, aber man hätte immerhin ein Minimum an Arbeit rein stecken können und das ganze reibungsloser machen können.","The game basically starts, and I was able to launch the single-player mode. However, getting there was a real hassle. Upon launching, it prompts you to log in. So I entered my credentials and received an error message. This happened every time! Then, instead of my email address, I tried my username and got another error message saying it wasn't an email address. So I used my email address again, and suddenly it worked.

The game then launched, and I had to log in again... The game then starts with an 800x600 resolution and needs to be adjusted.

Matchmaking for PvE didn't work; there were users in the lobby, but perhaps no one else was looking for a game. This needs further testing.

As I mentioned, I was able to launch a single-player game.

EA, it's great that you're bringing the old games back to the market directly on Steam, but you could have at least put in a minimum of effort to make the whole process smoother."

Юниты по количеству ограничены, строительства как такового нет, так ещё и нет саундтрека от Фрэнка Клепаки (к слову сказать саунд всё же был более-менее неплохой, эдакая переработка классики).
Также не понравилось, что добавили классы (по три для GDI и Nod: оборонительный, наступательный, поддержка и у каждого класса свои юниты), из-за чего нельзя менять тактику при любой возможности во время игры и это как показалось сильно ограничивает разнообразие геймплея.

Геймплей был рассчитан на кооператив, но можно было проходить и на пару с компом, что и было сделано в первый раз в момент выхода игры. Второй раз уже проходил с другом, благодаря чему стало чутка интереснее, даже с учётом того, что проходил почти сразу после первого раза.

Сюжет в целом мне понравился, но из-за того, что большая часть игры всё же составляет её геймплей было не шибко интересно играть.

Очень понравилась проработка видеороликов, которые были сняты не со штатива, как обычно. Только вот финальные ролики с белым фоном как-то выглядели помню сомнительно и странно. Да и актрисы в этой части не особо интересные, если вы понимаете о чем я.

5 успешных вознесений Кейна из 10'ти.

P. S. Пересмотрел на днях все видеоролики на Ютубе и могу отметить, что сделаны они более интересно, чем раньше. Там больше движухи и меньше ""штативной"" съёмки. Единственное что в них худо - это очень мало компьютерных кинематографических видеороликов и нет красивых актрис, как раньше. Ну и русский голос дубляжа Кейна в C&C 3 мне понравился больше.","The most controversial of all the C&C games due to its new gameplay style. Units are limited, there's no building as such, and there's no soundtrack by Frank Klepacki (which, by the way, was still pretty good, a sort of reworking of the classics).
I also didn't like the addition of classes (three each for GDI and Nod: defensive, offensive, and support, with each class having its own units). Because of this, you can't change tactics at any opportunity during the game, which seemed to greatly limit gameplay variety.

The gameplay was designed for co-op, but you could also play it with a computer, which was the case the first time around when the game was released. I played it with a friend the second time, which made it a bit more interesting, even though I finished it almost immediately after the first time.

I liked the overall story, but since the majority of the game is gameplay, it wasn't particularly engaging.

I really liked the production quality of the cutscenes, which weren't shot with a tripod, as usual. However, the final cutscenes with the white background looked a bit dubious and odd, I remember. And the actresses in this part aren't particularly interesting, if you know what I mean.

5 successful Kane ascensions out of 10.

P.S. I recently rewatched all the videos on YouTube and I can say that they're more interesting than before. There's more action and less tripod-based filming. The only downside is that there aren't many computer-generated cinematic cutscenes and the lack of beautiful actresses like before. I also liked Kane's Russian voice acting in C&C 3 better."

Give him a 17th anniversary, and he can continue to profit from the studio he himself disbanded. On March 8, 2023, EA abruptly released the Command & Conquer: The Final Collection. This immediately attracted widespread attention from players worldwide, with many spending money to support Westwood Studios' Cyberpunk franchise. The result? The game received was of prehistoric resolution, with utterly unimproved optimization that sent players back to their childhood. Even Red Alert 2 couldn't be purchased separately; the entire collection had to be bought. And Tiberium Twilight was a complete mess, with a login screen that hadn't been updated in over a decade, demonstrating EA's lack of conscience in this move.

一本坦克连人家工兵都打不动，进攻型基地基本只能眼看着对面工兵顶着炮火强换载具，更骚的是载具爆了对面工兵还能完整出来继续强换，哪怕是三星载具，克什么装甲的都一样，只能白给
切成防御性，碉堡在对面载具面前跟纸糊的一样，机枪下一个爆一个，任务给的装甲神兵十多轮射击才能打掉对面人型机甲，对面工兵依旧顶着火力强换载具，屯的三星人型机甲根本没什么输出空间，留着清对面工兵的一队三星步兵给对面喷火兵秒秒秒……
飞船坠毁关，出什么兵都换不过对面，最后守着变种人设施刷自爆兵硬拆才拆掉对面俩基地，50电的防御设施阻止不了对面三个兵占建筑……后边一队步兵给对面秒完了五秒都站不住，直接下支援爆工兵摁占对面残骸，终于打掉对面一轮无基地突袭。然后对面基地一下工兵一刷我就爆了……
网上找攻略……嗯？哪来的猛犸？

In the tank mission, even enemy engineers couldn't penetrate the tanks. Offensive bases were basically helpless, watching as enemy engineers endured heavy fire to force vehicle trades. Even worse, after a vehicle exploded, the enemy engineers could respawn intact and continue trading, even with three-star vehicles, regardless of armor type – they were just easy targets.

In defensive mode, bunkers were like paper in front of enemy vehicles, easily destroyed by machine guns. The armored vehicles given in the mission took over ten rounds to destroy the enemy humanoid mechs, while the enemy engineers continued to endure the fire to trade vehicles. The three-star humanoid mechs they had stockpiled had no room to deal damage; the squad of three-star infantry they kept to clear the enemy engineers were instantly wiped out by the enemy flamethrowers…

In the spaceship crash mission, no matter what units they deployed, they couldn't out-trade the enemy. Finally, they had to defend the mutant facility, spawning suicide bombers to brute force their way through and destroy two enemy bases. The 50-energy defensive structures couldn't stop three enemy units from occupying buildings… The next squad of infantry was wiped out in five seconds, so they immediately sent reinforcements to mass-produce engineers and hold the wreckage, finally thwarting the enemy's baseless assault. Then the enemy base spawned engineers and I was wiped out...
I looked for guides online...wait, where did the mammoths come from?

I went outside and found out the technology doesn't unlock with missions, it's globally locked. You have to grind game levels, and without levels, you only have the same units in every mode...GDINOD requires separate grinding, and there's a population cap... With the global lock, you can only grind by playing more skirmishes, but the skirmish population cap is 80 and the campaign population cap is 50... With the global lock, I get destroyed in campaigns and can only upgrade to Tier 2, and even then, there's no technology unlocking.

I really don't want to grind with the global lock, so I'm thinking of just watching the story online.

I can feel my lack of skill in StarCraft, but I can easily beat hard in COD3. In this game's easy mode, I only feel like I'm playing against bots with bricks. If I don't want to grind, I can only shrug."

真可惜没有介于“推荐”与“不推荐”之间的选项，游戏并不是特别差，只可惜被经营到一个半死不活的状态。
《命令与征服4：泰伯利亚黄昏》可以说是对该系列进行了一次大胆创新的变革。突破了传统的RTS玩法，也打破了曾经的CNC的游戏模式。但是变革也必将伴随着痛苦与质疑，尤其是顶着“《命令与征服》”这一沉重而辉煌的名号。
【“王八大战”的利与弊】
巨大的变革都在于此。
没有了前系列作的扩张基地建筑群的满足感；也没有了在同等时间大量堆兵的碾压快感；更没有了建造超级单位和武器的激动心情……
取而代之的是3种不同功能的移动MCV；双方共同被限制的单位人口；以及地图上固定时段刷出的升级资源……
基于种种改变，游戏的玩法也发生了巨大的变化。在本作中则更注重于不同MCV的功能与机动，并且玩家也需要在人口资源的限制之下决定在不同的时段应该怎样分配单位的生产与作战时的组合，再者就是该怎么利用手上现有的力量来完成升级资源的抢夺或者是达成任务目标等等目的。
由此可见，这一作更注重的是单位与功能的组合与资源分配，并且也大大提升了其网游化的程度，更推崇玩家之间的合作与对抗，尤其在团队对抗时，不同玩家选择不同的MCV也会有不同的分工与搭配，使得游戏性有了质的飞跃。
但是从反向来看，这样的改变也是带来了很多不利因素。头一个就是老派的CNC玩家可不一定认账，从内容上看则是有太多的简化，而且玩法上的差异也并不会让人立马适应而觉得玩起来会很舒服。而且地图的设计也变得更加死板，几乎是清一色的竞技向地图，大大减少初始站位的偶然性，使得其过度电竞化。最大诟病的因素之一就是糟糕的人口限制，虽说在一定程度上抑制了人海堆兵，但也减少了单位组合多样化的可能性，降低了战术尝试过程中带来的容错率。
总的来说，针对如果真的是找不来朋友，或者不能快速适应新模式的玩家来说，这一系列的改动则是失败的。
【旧碗装新饭】
一个“4”字可以说是正传的正统延续，但制作组却并没有因此去使用新的引擎，而是沿用了CNC3的老引擎来制作CNC4，所以不论是在界面操作，以及游戏内的操作都透漏着一种没什么进步的感觉，甚至会让玩家觉得这是用旧的东西改出来大型官方模组。一度还夹杂着赶工与减料的嫌疑。
【平淡却不得不叙说的故事】
作为最终章来说，故事内容是合格的，最大的缺点就是短小急促。但因CNC3和《凯恩之怒》的素质就已经摆在那里，所以本作作为最终章能做到这个程度也是实属不易。演员的演技似乎只有凯恩和妻子在线，其他演员略微有些尬演，而GDI司令弄一个黑人大妈来扮演多少有点zzzq的味道，而且整体看来显得相当违和。拍摄布景虽然显得简略，但表演者的镜头感则是相当的不错，也算是对此有另一方面的弥补。
故事依然是GDI 和NOD之间的对抗，但随着全球环境的恶化，人们也不得不在不同的理念中做出抉择。而主角“指挥官”就是其中重要的一位。他曾解救GDI的上司与其一同起义来阻止敌人的野心；也曾为NOD铲除叛党替身凯恩实现升天大计。终于信徒们去往新的世界，而地球也结束了战乱的循环。
如果说伴随着长达15年的陪伴最终要以这一作来画上句号，那应该就是在升天传送门打开时，凯恩对玩家说的那句包含了诸多意义的：
“谢谢你”。
不想完全压死这个游戏，只能说：
好玩，但并不耐玩","Since ""Dawn"" in 1995, the Command & Conquer series has entered its final ""twilight.""

It's a pity there's no ""recommended"" or ""not recommended"" option; the game isn't particularly bad, but it was unfortunately managed to remain in a state of near-death.

Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight can be considered a bold and innovative revolution for the series. It broke through traditional RTS gameplay and shattered the previous CNC game mode. However, change inevitably comes with pain and skepticism, especially bearing the heavy yet glorious name of ""Command & Conquer.""

【The Pros and Cons of the ""Battle of the Turtle""】 The huge changes lie here.

The satisfaction of expanding base buildings like in previous installments is gone; the overwhelming thrill of massing troops in equal time is gone; and the excitement of building super units and weapons is gone… Instead, there are three different mobile MCVs with varying functions; a shared limit on unit population for both sides; and upgrade resources that spawn at fixed times on the map… Based on these changes, the gameplay has also undergone a significant transformation. This game places greater emphasis on the functions and mobility of different MCVs. Players must also decide how to allocate unit production and combat combinations at different times within the constraints of population resources. Furthermore, they must utilize their existing forces to seize upgrade resources or achieve mission objectives.

Therefore, this game focuses more on unit and function combinations and resource allocation, significantly enhancing its online gaming aspect and promoting player cooperation and competition. Especially in team battles, different players choosing different MCVs will have different roles and combinations, resulting in a qualitative leap in gameplay.

However, this change also brings several disadvantages. Firstly, old-school CNC players may not appreciate it. The content is too simplified, and the gameplay differences may not be immediately adaptable or comfortable. Moreover, the map design has become more rigid, almost entirely consisting of competitive maps, greatly reducing the randomness of initial positioning and making it overly esports-oriented. One of the biggest criticisms is the poor population limit. While it somewhat curbs the over-concentration of troops, it also reduces the diversity of unit combinations and lowers the margin for error during tactical experimentation.

In short, for players who genuinely can't find friends or can't quickly adapt to the new mode, these changes are a failure.

【Old Bowl, New Rice】 The number ""4"" can be seen as a legitimate continuation of the main series, but the development team didn't use a new engine. Instead, they used the old CNC3 engine to create CNC4. Therefore, both the interface and in-game controls feel stagnant, even making players feel like it's a large-scale official mod made from old components. It even carried a hint of being rushed and cost-cutting.

【A Bland but Necessary Story】 As the final chapter, the story content is adequate, its biggest flaw being its brevity and rushed pace. However, given the quality of CNC3 and Kane's Wrath, this final chapter's achievement is quite remarkable. The acting seemed only solid on Kane and his wife; the other actors' performances were somewhat awkward, and casting a Black woman as the GDI Commander felt a bit politically charged and ultimately quite jarring. While the set design was simple, the actors' on-screen presence was quite good, somewhat compensating for this.

The story remains the conflict between GDI and NOD, but with global environmental degradation, people are forced to make choices between different ideologies. The protagonist, the ""Commander,"" is a key figure in this struggle. He rescued his GDI superior and joined the uprising to thwart the enemy's ambitions; he also helped NOD eliminate the traitorous double Kane, enabling his ascension. Finally, the believers went to a new world, and Earth ended its cycle of war.

If this game truly marks the end of a 15-year journey, it's Kane's meaningful words to the player when the ascension portal opens:

""Thank you.""

To avoid completely condemning the game, I can only say: Fun, but not very replayable."

Но она все равно может в любой момент разорвать соединение с сервером. Даже в сингле. А это для always online игры очень плохо.

В общем, она все равно уг по всем статьям.

***
Купил игру на релизе, но тогда поиграл 5 минут и понял, что она УГ. Спустя много лет решил все-таки узнать чем именно ""закончилась"" C&C, но это уже много лет практически невозможно сделать, потому что игра работает через сервера ЕА и они - вроде как - отключены уже долгие годы. Кто-то на форумах утверждает, что сумел пробиться в игру (не через первый логин перед игрой, а через второй - внутри игры после вступительной заставки - лол, да, тут два раза логиниться надо), но это похоже на байки уровня ""в моей версии GTA можно заходить в каждый дом, но я тебе ее не дам - папа не разрешает"".

Этой проблеме уже сто лет, она была в ориджине, теперь вернулась в стим. Есть еще в интернете какие-то танцы с бубнами с ""оффлайн сервером"", но на ориджине у меня в свое время не сработало, а тут даже проверять не хочу. У меня только один вопрос есть.

Как вообще валв позволяет продавать откровенным мошенникам игру, которую невозможно запустить?","Update: I found a tip online about deleting/renaming a file in the Windows folder – it worked, and the game reaches the main menu. But it can still disconnect from the server at any time. Even in single-player. And that's very bad for an always-online game.

Basically, it's still crap on all counts.

***
I bought the game on release, but after playing for five minutes, I realized it was crap. Many years later, I finally decided to find out how exactly C&C ""ended,"" but it's been practically impossible for years because the game runs on EA servers, and they've supposedly been down for years. Someone on the forums claims to have gotten into the game (not through the first login before the game, but through a second one – in-game after the intro cutscene – lol, yes, you have to log in twice), but that sounds like a story like, ""In my version of GTA, you can go into every house, but I won't give it to you – my dad won't let you.""

This problem is a long-standing one; it was in Origin, and now it's back on Steam. There's some online hype about an ""offline server,"" but it didn't work for me on Origin, and I don't even want to try it here. I just have one question.

How does Valve even allow outright scammers to sell a game that's impossible to launch?"

Для тех кто хочет  просто  узнать историю Кейна и сберечь подгорающий стул и не утираться от такого ведра помоев вылитых на вас разработчиками, то лучше просто посмотреть ролики на youtube.
Еще раз - это не Command & Conquer, а совсем другая игра, на которую натянули легендарное имя серии и сюжет. К покупке категорически не рекомендуется, разве что за халяву для коллекции. 

Теперь о игре:
Плюсы: только название и Кейн

Минусы - это буквально ВСЕ :
1. Базы - нет, вместо них ущербные краулеры (своеобразный ходячий цех) 3-х видов - атака,защита,поддержка. В итоге будете использовать только один (скорее всего первый - атака). Краулер защиты использовал один раз и то где требовалось по сюжету построить бункер (долго тупил как призвать этот крацлер, оказалось надо предыдущий уничтожить!!! кнопка [Del] в интерфейсе нет! или я не нашел), все остальное время атака (наземная техника) и немного для разнообразия поддержка (авиация). 
2. Сбор ресурсов - нет, если не считать выпадающие боксы из врагов(для улучшения юнита) и огрызков тиберия для развития технологий 
3. Постройка юнитов - абсолютное ограничение по количеству, причем не в штуках, а в  фиксированных количествах очков (каждый юнит свое количество очков)
4. Юниты - дизайн это что то  извращенное практически никак не похожее на предыдущие серии, кроме нескольких видов (таких как мамонт-танк, мастодонт и тп). Например танк скорпион - это реально по виду насекомое с обелиском на хвосте ) В процессе игры вы будете из всего разнообразия использовать только пару видов + ремонтник 
5. Геймплэй - забудьте то зачем мы пришли в С&С, больше нет того очарования строительства баз, сбор такого драгоценного тиберия,  отслеживание этих неуклюжих харвестеров, требующих постоянной опеки, рэйды авиацией,  накопление сил, защиты базы, атаки на врага ударной группировкой, запуск ядерной ракеты или удары спутником....... ничего этого нет.  Больше не испытать того чувства  когда вырастает только что построенный обелиск в пылу защиты вашей базы и такой чарующий звук зззззззззз-пиу. Будут только небольшие локальные стычки по всей карте ограниченным контингентом юнитов.
6. Графика - как движок нормально, как дизайн - ужас. Художественное оформления начиная от меню, карты и заканчивая юнитами совершенно не в стиле С&С. Ощущение другой игры будет вас преследовать на всем протяжении истории.
7. Видеоролики - как по мне так на троечку. Занудно, непонятно зачем вплетена, довольно несуразно, линия отношений Коммандера и его жены. 
8. Музыка - это пипец и днище, не потому что плохая, а потому что классическая музыка и композиции с фолк (Фолк Карл!!!) мотивами выглядят чужеродно для этой  игры. 
9. Постоянно  при запуска требует ввода пароля от EA, причем одного раза мало - дважды!  Регистрация тоже квэст, который нужно пройти через лаунчер EA и там ввести сначала ключ из Стима (есть руководство как это сделать можете найти)

Если ЕА действительно хотела закончить серию, то покончить с ней ей действительно получилось в отличии от самой игры.","In short, this isn't C&C (Command & Conquer), it's a slap in the face to the entire fandom of the series.

For those who simply want to learn Kane's story and save their burning chair, rather than have to deal with the developers' filth, it's best to just watch the videos on YouTube.
Again, this isn't Command & Conquer, but a completely different game, stretching the series' legendary name and plot. It's strongly not recommended for purchase, unless you're looking for a freebie to add to your collection.

Now about the game:
Pros: just the name and Kane.

Cons: literally EVERYTHING:
1. There are no bases, instead there are crippled crawlers (a kind of walking workshop) of three types – attack, defense, and support. Ultimately, you'll only use one (most likely the first – attack). I used the Defense Crawler once, and that was when the story required me to build a bunker (I struggled with how to summon this crawler for a long time, but it turns out I had to destroy the previous one!!! There's no [Del] button in the interface! Or maybe I couldn't find it). The rest of the time, I'm attacking (ground vehicles) and, for variety, supporting (aircraft).

2. Resource collection - none, unless you count the boxes dropped by enemies (for unit upgrades) and Tiberium cores for technology development.
3. Unit construction - an absolute limit on quantity, not in units, but in fixed points (each unit has its own point value).
4. Unit design is something perverse, practically unlike previous series, with the exception of a few types (such as the Mammoth Tank, Mastodon, etc.). For example, the Scorpion tank actually looks like an insect with an obelisk on its tail. During the game, you'll only use a couple of different types and a repair tank.
5. Gameplay - forget why we came to S&S in the first place. The charm of building bases, collecting precious Tiberium, tracking those clumsy harvesters that require constant care, air raids, amassing forces, defending a base, attacking the enemy with a strike force, launching a nuclear missile, or launching satellite strikes is gone. None of that is there. You won't experience that feeling of a newly built obelisk rising in the heat of defending your base, accompanied by that enchanting zzzzzzzzzzz-pew sound. There will only be small, localized skirmishes across the map with a limited number of units.
6. Graphics - the engine is fine, but the design is terrible. The art, from the menus and maps to the units, is completely uninspired by S&S. The feeling of playing a different game will haunt you throughout the entire story.
7. The cutscenes are a C, in my opinion. The storyline between the Commander and his wife is tedious, and the storyline is woven inconsequentially and awkwardly.

8. The music is abysmal, not because it's bad, but because classical music and compositions with folk (Folk Carl!!!) motifs feel out of place in this game.

9. It constantly asks you to enter your EA password upon launch, and once isn't enough – twice! Registration is also a quest, requiring you to go through the EA launcher and enter your Steam key first (there's a guide on how to do this, you can find it here).

If EA really wanted to end the series, they really succeeded, unlike the game itself."

[b]ремастер категорически рекомендую!  [/b]   [/i] 


играть в C&C начал с red alert на первой PS сто тысяч лет назад, с этой rts  у меня любовь на века. прошел  C&C вдоль и поперек.

Generals вызывал по-началу небольшие сомнения, но уже после пары миссий  пролетел всю кампанию на одном дыхании, а после и адон заценил. исключение только одно-уродливый выкидыш с цифрой 4, его бросил через 10 часов игры и забыл. tiberian dawn, который я почему-то пропустил, стал настоящим подарком от разрабов.  отыграл кампанию за ГСБ на сложной, получив нереальный фан. дальше с большим  удовольствием пройду за НОД, а после обязательно понастальгирую  в red alert.

ремастер получился весьма годный, это все тот же эталон, но с посвежевшей картинкой, которая определенно радует глаз и новым саундом, который так же хорош, как и в класической игре.  хотя я принципиально не беру игры дороже 5-6 сотен рублей, здесь потраченные полтора рубля абсолютно не жалко! 

[b]ЭТО МАМОНТ, ЖДУ УКАЗАНИЙ [/b]","[h1] C&C Remaster Review![/h1]

[i] The beautiful and awesome region block prevents me from reviewing the remaster.
[b]I highly recommend the remaster! [/b] [/i]

I started playing C&C with Red Alert on the first PS4 a hundred thousand years ago, and I've been in love with this RTS for ages. I've played C&C through and through.

Generals was a bit iffy at first, but after a couple of missions, I blew through the entire campaign in one breath, and then I really appreciated the expansion pack. The only exception was the ugly miscarriage with the number 4; I abandoned it after 10 hours of play and forgot about it. Tiberian Dawn, which I somehow missed, was a real gift from the developers. I played the GDI campaign on hard mode and had incredible fun. I'll be thrilled to play through the rest of the campaign with Nod, and then I'll definitely revel in Red Alert.

The remaster turned out quite well; it's still the same standard, but with a refreshed visual style that's definitely pleasing to the eye and a new soundtrack that's just as good as the classic game's. While I generally don't buy games over 500-600 rubles, the extra 1.5 rubles spent here are absolutely worth it!

This game is bad and ruined Gaming. Every idea and implementation in this game ruins gaming.
The fact that this game exists hurts gaming.
Much like many other games by other people.
This is a bad game. Do not buy it, even 99% off.
Don't play it unless they pay you a good amount per hour.
If you say anything good about it without getting paid you are in fact in possession of poor judgement.

Als jemand, der als Kind Command & Conquer auf der PS1 geliebt hat und nun die Teile auf Steam nachholt, habe ich mich sehr auf dieses Spiel gefreut. Leider wurde meine Erwartungen nicht erfüllt.

Ein deutliches Problem in Command & Conquer 4 ist das offensichtliche EA-Prinzip, Spieleentwickler zu kaufen und dann Spiele in kurzen Abständen herauszubringen, bis die einst erfolgreiche Spielereihe letztendlich kaputt ist. Dies hat auch hier seine Spuren hinterlassen. Das Spiel fühlt sich nicht mehr wie ein authentisches Command & Conquer an, sondern eher wie ein liebloses Produkt, das nur darauf aus ist, Geld zu generieren.

Die technische Umsetzung von Command & Conquer 4 lässt zu wünschen übrig. Die Grafik ist zwar solide für die Zeit, aber es gibt technische Probleme und Ungenauigkeiten, die das Spielerlebnis beeinträchtigen und den Spaß nehmen. Man quält sich beinahe durch das Spiel.

Alles in allem kann ich Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight nur als enttäuschend bezeichnen. Es ist ein Beispiel dafür, wie eine einst erfolgreiche Spielereihe durch das Einmischen von EA ruiniert werden kann. 

Keine Kaufempfehlung","Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight is a disappointing sequel to a once-great game series. As someone who loved Command & Conquer on the PS1 as a kid and is now catching up on the games on Steam, I was really looking forward to this one. Unfortunately, my expectations were not met.

A significant problem with Command & Conquer 4 is the obvious EA strategy of buying game developers and then releasing games in quick succession until the once-successful franchise is ultimately ruined. This has left its mark here as well. The game no longer feels like an authentic Command & Conquer title, but rather like a half-baked product solely focused on making money.

The technical execution of Command & Conquer 4 leaves much to be desired. While the graphics are decent for their time, there are technical issues and inaccuracies that detract from the gameplay and spoil the fun. Playing the game is almost a chore.

All in all, I can only describe Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight as disappointing. It's an example of how a once-successful game series can be ruined by EA's interference.

Для начало я не играл ни в одну игру из этой вселенной кроме вот этой, но я смотрел так сказать историю происходящего персонажей и как оно появилось и чем закончилось и так же смотрел все ответления от основной части так же смотрел графу и сам по себе гемплей.
Я скажу так мне эта часть игры очень нравится хотя бы по той причине что у неё графика для своего года очень классная и модельки пехоты и строений тоже нравится, единственное что огорчает это лимит на пехоты и строений (насчёт пехоты и строений я не знаю был ли лимит в прошлых частях хотя наскок понял или не было или был но и того и другого можно было создать много) ещё огорчает то что слишком маленький сюжет и честно скажу слишком высокая ценна для этой игры потому что хочется больше сюжета чем графики.
Это было моё мнение насчёт игры чисто субъективное а теперь совет тем кто всё же захочет её купить понимаю что мало и вряд ли понадобится учитывая что игра мёртвая почти но всё же,
если вы играли в прошлые части этой игры то вам вряд ли понравится эта часть из за короткости и маленького лимита на производство пехоты и строений но всё же, если решитесь её купить то только по скидке ибо ценна и в правду кусается","I want to express my opinion on this game. First off, I haven't played any games from this universe except this one, but I did follow the backstory of the characters, how they came to be, how they ended, and I also watched all the spinoffs from the main game, as well as the graphics and the gameplay itself.
I'll say this: I really like this part of the game, if only because the graphics are very cool for its age, and I also like the infantry and building models. The only thing that's disappointing is the limit on infantry and buildings (I don't know if there was a limit on infantry and buildings in the previous games, although I quickly figured out whether there was one, or not, but you could have created a lot of both). Another disappointment is that the story is too short, and frankly, the price tag is too high for this game because I want more story than graphics. This was my purely subjective opinion about the game, but now my advice to those who still want to buy it. I understand that it's not much and is unlikely to be needed, considering the game is almost dead, but still,
if you played the previous parts of this game, you probably won't like this one due to its short length and the small limit on infantry and building production. Still, if you decide to buy it, only at a discount, because it's really expensive."

Le seul point positif, c'est qu'il reste fidèle au lore du jeu sur les unités (encore heureux !)

Le gameplay est juste... mauvais.... il est très mal équilibrer. Vue qu'il n'y a plus de récolte, par moment, la mission se résume soit à tout défoncer avec la petite compo de base que vous avez fait avec vos points car la réparation peut être très forte avec juste 2 ou 3 réparateurs.... ou bien cela se résume à du spam d'unités qui vont à la boucherie car l'IA vous envoie énormément de troupe dessus.

Le jeu est très court comparer aux nombres de mission que l'on a habitude avec les autres C&C. au totalement 3 missions du GDI comme début pour le tuto commun au deux factions et puis 7 missions pour chaque faction....

I really thought the criticism was overblown because there was an attempt to be overly purist... but no, really.

The only positive point is that it remains faithful to the game's lore regarding the units (thankfully!).

The gameplay is just... bad... it's very poorly balanced. Since there's no more resource gathering, at times the mission boils down to either destroying everything with the small basic army composition you've built with your points because repairs can be very powerful with just two or three repairers... or it boils down to spamming units that are sent to the slaughter because the AI ​​sends tons of troops at you.

The game is very short compared to the number of missions we're used to with other C&C games. A total of 3 GDI missions as a starting point for the common tutorial for both factions, and then 7 missions for each faction...

In short, a disgrace, plain and simple. I only finished it to see the end of the saga... and even then, it's disappointing. The ending is really rushed... My god, what a lousy conclusion to such an epic saga."

Возможно, будь данная прекраснейшая ""четвертая"" часть, не ""четвертой"" для легендарной серии C&C, а первой для какой-нибудь новой вселенной, ВОЗМОЖНО (но это не точно), было бы хоть немного понятно почему всё так плохо (первый блин комом и все дела).

Игра совершенно не пригодна для мультиплеера и сражений с ботами, да и впринципе какого-либо вида соревнований между игроками. Она, скорее, заточена под ""Пройди сюжет и забудь что ты это проходил"", хотя и сам сюжет какой-то рвано-рашно-непонятный. Всё происходит очень быстро, то мы тут, то мы уже там, то всё плохо, то вроде бы жить можно, то Кейн хороший, то плохой...
Уже не говоря о том, что совершенно не рассказывается что же произошло и почему Братство обозлилось на Кейна и почему вдруг Кейн решил отдать Тацит ГСБшникам и вообще как он вышел на сотрудничество с ними. Огромная дыра в сюжете с момента окончания 3-ей и до начала 4-ой части.
[hr][/hr]
Говоря же про сам ГЕЙмплей. Моей любимой частью серии является C&C 3: KW и, думаю, все кто играл в неё и в своё время решили попробовать сей продукт, почувствовали ужасную пустоту внутри, а именно:

* Скринов нет от слова совсем, только ГСБ и НОД (в сравнении с 9 фракциями (3 основные +2 подфракции для каждой) в KW);

* Строительства базы нет - один краулер (типа МСЦ) и тот по сути даже  и не постройка. Их 3 вида, что тоже немного угнетает. Хочешь играть от авиации - вот тебе краулер под это, но нормальные наземки сделать не сможешь. И впринципе это разделение ролей на Танк, Саппорт и ДД убивает какое-либо желание относить эту игру к стратегии. Добро пожаловать в RTS версию Team Fortress, Господа (ну или Overwatch, отзыв всё же в 2022 пишется);

* Экономика, которая в мультиплеере всегда являлась основной целью и по сути побеждал тот, кто лучше построит свою и испортит вражескую? Не - держите кристальчик тиберия, который надо кое-как доставить на спавн, чтобы вкачать свой краулер, чтобы делать войска посильнее и прокачивать те что уже есть.

* Динамика боя? Попытки скрытно подлезть и что-то сделать? Да, как бы, никто не запрещает, но зачем? Захват точек зависит от войск внутри зоны, а не от того, у кого там жива турелька на спавне;
Да и сама механика захвата точек. Я блин играю в Battlefield или в RTS? Моей целью должно быть уничтожение вражеских сил, а не захват и удержание каких-то непонятных точек, особо даже не понятно зачем. Я был бы совершенно не против, будь это частью геймплея, аля ""Будешь держать эти точки - будет тебе преимущество"", т.е. чтобы это было компонентом (как те же Тибериевые Вышки (спайки) в третьей части или Центр управления ЭМИ) для достижения какой-то более крупной цели, а не самоцелью боя;

* Разные стили игры? Макро и Микро? Не, не слышали. Ты можешь быть бесконечно крутым игроком в макро, но какой в этом смысл, если у тебя лимит на юниты? Поспамить не выйдет - да, отчасти это добавляет ""тактики"" в игру - нельзя втупую наспамить юнитов и громить все подряд, это бесспорно плюс такого решения, но, при этом, если мы говорим про чуть более высокий уровень игры, чем совсем нубский, даже при игре от спама, без микроконтроля и тактики ты не выиграешь, а получается мы ""победили"" проблему которой, собственно, и не было, а только лишь ограничили свободу действий игрока, потому что ему, чтобы ""законтрить"" бюлд врага, надо буквально отправить свои войска на фарш, чтобы тебе дало сделать новые.
Сама механика ""контра"" войск тоже сделана прям максимально не комфортно и не понятно на что расчитана. Было всё просто: есть пехота, техника, авиация и постройки. Вот тебе для каждого из этих видов юниты, которые эффективны против них, причем, было достаточно очевидно, кто против кого (пули - пехота, ракеты - техника и авиация, гранаты/огонь - постройки) и отсутствие каких-либо ограничений позволяло быстро отреагировать на то или иное решение противника. 
Сейчас же: легкая, средняя, тяжелая броня и ты смотришь на юнит и не понимаешь кто против него эффективен. Как по мне довольно смешно, когда танк с двумя огромными пулеметами буквально щекочет пехоту врага, потому что у них броня не того типа, против которого пули эффективны - да, можно привыкнуть и придр**читься, но это усложняет и запутывает то, что, как раз таки, лучше оставить максимально простым и интуитивно понятным, дабы в бою ты был сконцентрирован на более важных вещах с точки зрения тактики;

* Опять же, до жути не хватает разнообразия самих юнитов. Если в старой части 9 фракций имели достаточно неплохой набор каждого из типов юнитов (хотя, конечно, кто-то скажет что в сравнении с другими стратегиями их было мало, но лично я считаю, что ""больше"" не значит ""лучше"", особенно для RTS - их было ровно столько, сколько ""достаточно""), то в этой части, мало того, что по сути мы, в основном, получили перерисованные модельки тех же самых с точки зрения механик юнитов, так ещё и без особого их разнообразия. И вот здесь действительно чувствуется отсутствие третьей стороны конфликта в виде пришельцев, слишком однотипными получаются бои, ОСОБЕННО если учесть, что теперь нельзя воевать например НОД vs НОД, каждый матч - это НОД vs ГСБ, что окончательно добивает малейшие надежды на разнообразие.

* Самое ужасное - прокачка. Если в старых частях прокачка отсутствовала и механика блокировки юнитов была только в Кампании и сделана была лишь для того, чтобы преподносить сюжет корректно и ты не громил первые миссии тир 3 войсками, то в этой части, даже для мультиплеера и сражений, тебе необходимо получать уровень, который открывает тебе юниты. Т.е., говоря простым языком: хочешь пойти поиграть против других людей - сначала часов эдак очень много погоняй ботов, чтобы получить ранг, кстати, для НОД и ГСБ он отдельный, т.е. получаем в сумме (эдак очень много)х2 гоняний ботов. Причем, когда ты получаешь ранг, тебе эти юниты становятся доступны и в кампании, что превращает изначально достаточно не простые миссии, в легкую прогулку, если ты достиг максимального уровня. Данную механику я совершенно так и не понял зачем вообще было вводить, ведь эти ранги абсолютно не отражают насколько ты опытен в этой игре, а лишь делают твой ""старт"" в ней более болезненным и долгим, с одной стороны да, продлевая игровые часы в ней, но с другой, эти часы удовольствием явно не наполнены.

* А ещё, запустив сие чудо вновь и буквально зайдя в сражение с ботами, я осознал насколько здесь ужасный интерфейс. Он огромен и занимает почти весь экран (при разрешении 1920х1080 на минуточку), куча кнопок разбросано по разным углам, причем эти кнопки можно было сделать маленькими, либо вообще вынести в хот-кеи и не занимать мой экран ими...

В общем, подытоживая, хотелось бы верить, что разработчики никогда не займутся ремастером этого ""шедевра"", а если и займутся, то скорее сделают из него совершенно другую игру, действительно достойную звания 4 части культовой серии.","[b]An excellent game[/b], demonstrating how not to do things.

Perhaps if this wonderful ""fourth"" part were not the ""fourth"" for the legendary C&C series, but the first for some new universe, MAYBE (but I'm not sure), it would be at least a little clearer why everything is so bad (the first pancake is always a flop, and all that).

The game is completely unsuitable for multiplayer, bot battles, or any kind of competition between players. It's more geared toward ""Complete the story and forget you even played it,"" even though the story itself is disjointed and incomprehensible. Everything happens so fast: one moment we're here, the next we're gone, one moment everything's bad, the next it's ok, Kane is good, the next he's bad...

Not to mention the complete lack of explanation of what happened, why the Brotherhood got mad at Kane, why Kane suddenly decided to hand the Tacitus over to GDI, and how he even ended up collaborating with them. There's a huge plot hole from the end of Part 3 to the beginning of Part 4.
[hr][/hr]
Speaking of the GAMEPLAY itself. My favorite part of the series is C&C 3: KW, and I think everyone who played it and decided to try this game felt a terrible emptiness inside, namely:

* There are absolutely no screenshots, only GDI and Nod (compared to 9 factions (3 main + 2 subfactions for each) in KW);

* There's no base building—just one crawler (like the MSC), and that's not really even a building. There are three types, which is a bit depressing. If you want to play with air power, there's a crawler for that, but you can't build decent ground forces. And basically, this division of roles into Tank, Support, and Damage Dealer kills any desire to consider this game a strategy game. Welcome to the RTS version of Team Fortress, gentlemen (or Overwatch, I'm writing this review in 2022, after all);

* The economy, which in multiplayer has always been the main goal, and the winner is essentially whoever builds their own better and ruins the enemy's? No—here's a Tiberium crystal that needs to be hauled to spawn to upgrade your crawler, make your troops stronger, and upgrade the ones you already have.

* Combat dynamics? Attempts to sneak up and do something? Yeah, no one's stopping me, but why? Capturing points depends on the troops inside the zone, not on whoever has a live turret at spawn.
And the point-capture mechanics themselves. Am I playing Battlefield or an RTS? My goal should be to destroy enemy forces, not capture and hold some obscure points, and I don't even really understand why. I wouldn't be against it at all if it were part of the gameplay, like ""Hold these points and you'll have an advantage,"" i.e., if it were a component (like the Tiberium Spikes in the third game or the EMP Control Center) to achieve some larger goal, not the end of the battle itself.

* Different playstyles? Macro and Micro? No, never heard of them. You can be an infinitely skilled macro player, but what's the point if you have a unit limit? Spamming isn't an option—yes, it adds some ""tactics"" to the game—you can't just spam units and smash everything, which is definitely a plus. However, if we're talking about a slightly higher level of play than a complete noob, even spamming, without micromanagement and tactics, you won't win. So, we've ""solved"" a problem that didn't actually exist, but merely limited the player's freedom of action. To counter an enemy's unit, they have to literally send their troops to the dogs, allowing you to create new ones.
The counter-troop mechanics themselves are also extremely awkward and unclear. Everything used to be simple: there were infantry, vehicles, aircraft, and buildings. Here you have units for each of these types that are effective against them, and it was fairly obvious who was against whom (bullets - infantry, missiles - vehicles and aircraft, grenades/fire - buildings), and the lack of any restrictions allowed you to quickly respond to any enemy decision.

Now: light, medium, heavy armor, and you look at a unit and have no idea which is effective against it. I find it rather funny when a tank with two huge machine guns literally tickles enemy infantry because their armor isn't the type that bullets are effective against. Yes, you can get used to it and become picky, but it complicates and confuses what is best left as simple and intuitive as possible, so that in battle you can focus on more important tactical matters.

* Again, the lack of variety in the units themselves is terribly lacking. While in the old game, the 9 factions had a fairly decent selection of each unit type (although, of course, some might say they were underpowered compared to other strategy games, but I personally believe that ""more"" doesn't mean ""better,"" especially for an RTS—there were just enough). In this game, not only are we essentially getting redesigned models of the same units in terms of mechanics, but there's also little variety. And here, the lack of a third side in the conflict in the form of aliens is truly noticeable; battles become too repetitive, ESPECIALLY considering that you can't now fight, for example, Nod vs. Nod; every match is Nod vs. GDI, which completely destroys any hope of variety.

* The worst part is the leveling. While the older games lacked leveling and the unit locking mechanic was only present in the Campaign, designed solely to convey the storyline correctly and prevent you from crushing the first missions with Tier 3 troops, in this game, even for multiplayer and battles, you need to level up to unlock units. Simply put, if you want to play against other players, you first have to spend a lot of hours chasing bots to gain a rank. Incidentally, there's a separate rank for Nod and GDI, meaning you get a total of (likely a lot) x2 bot chasing. Moreover, once you reach a rank, these units become available to you in the campaign, which turns what were initially quite challenging missions into a breeze once you've reached the maximum level. I still don't understand why this mechanic was even introduced, as these ranks don't reflect your experience in this game at all. They only make your ""start"" more painful and time-consuming. While this extends the gameplay, it's clearly not enjoyable.

* Also, after launching this marvel again and literally jumping into a battle with bots, I realized how terrible the interface is. It's huge, taking up almost the entire screen (at a resolution of 1920x1080, mind you), with tons of buttons scattered all over the place, even though these buttons could have been made smaller, or even placed in hotkeys so they wouldn't take up my screen...

In short, I'd like to believe the developers will never remaster this ""masterpiece,"" and if they do, they'll likely make it into a completely different game, truly worthy of being the fourth installment in this iconic series."

""Twilight? More like Twi-shite!""

---

I remember playing this game when it first came out. I first started playing games from the C&C franchise with Tiberium Wars, and from that day, bought every single one the day it came out. I decided to rebuy Twilight on Steam because I'd since lost the DVD and thought ""maybes its not as bad as I remember"". Wow, that was incorrect.

The game-play is shoddy, and a complete departure from previous C&C games (change isn't a bad thing, but EA made some pretty horrendous changes to the format). The soundtrack is completely unmemorable, and completely lacking in any memorable tracks! Its just got no spirit.

Now, let's talk about a stable of the C&C franchise; the hammy F.M.V. cut-scenes. Well they are certainly hammy, but you can really tell that literally nobody is enjoying the scripts they've been handed - in fact, I'm shocked Joe Kucan didn't walk off set demanding a better set of lines... which leads me onto a bigger issue. The story!

The story has got to be the most boring, lazy waste of space in the history of the franchise, and that's really saying something, since Generals and Zero Hour were just a generic war thriller. What I will say, is that at least those two games had functional stories; 'Twilight' plops you into GDI command and introduces you to your character's wife who does nothing except cry and get sentimental. Its like the writers clearly want you to care about her, but they give you no reason. You feel absolutely no sympathy for her - I thought it was just my issue cause she's not my type, because I'm as gay as a bloody West End musical! But most people seem to hate her character.

Do I recommend this game? No, not even to the hardcore fans of the franchise. I mean if you're really, genuinely curious then feel free to watch a YouTube play-through because its not worth wasting your hard earned cash.","Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight' ~ 2/10

Instead of a regular base you get choice between the three walking tanks - crawlers, that can produce units, build defenses or call up support abilities, like bombing the area or laying down mines. While the concept might sound fun on paper and there are a lot of games built around similar ideas, the game pulls it off completely wrong. Now that your base is walking around the map, there’s no need to collect resources, so you can build whenever you want, but your maximum number of units is limited. This makes the campaign so much harder, because your enemies usually have multiple crawlers and so the bigger unit limit. At times I felt like I was deadlocked into a stalemate, because the enemy produced units at the same time as I destroyed them. However, the stupidness of the AI helps very much in such cases. If you focus your fire on the enemy base, AI will not notice it most of the time and will keep destroying your units, but you can keep replacing them almost at the same rate as they can.

I won’t go into story details here, first of all because it requires at least some knowledge of previous games. Second of all, it’s so bland and generic in this game, that you will probably forget it as soon as you close the game. The graphics look ok, doesn’t feel like they’ve changed much since previous game and it still has a 30 FPS lock, that no one in the modding community bothered to remove, so you’ll be stuck with that if you decide to play it. The FMV cutscenes have changed for the worse, it feels like they cut the budget in half. The original costumes are gone, now soldiers wear the same outfits as in our world, other characters wear plain clothes. A quick reminder that the game takes place in the year 2077 and the cities in the video reports they show you throughout the game look the same as in 2010.

本身质量什么的就不提了，这游戏临下架前是个什么状态呢？服务器经常出错，上EA论坛发贴询问，社区经理要么完全不知道，要么只会丢出几个屁用没有的“解决方案”。

这次下架意味着，玩家的单位解锁进度、对战记录都会烟消云散，而更为重要的是，由于单人战役也需要全程联网才能存档，即便剧情战役是烂到姥姥家去的屑作，CNC泰伯利亚系列以后再想去体验这一故事线将变得不可能以正版渠道来实现。系列正作用纯联机游戏的形式来体现，其不可靠性不言自明。

现在Steam商店页面甚至把多人联机标签撕了，那看来EA算是主动放弃售卖了。如果EA就是这种态度的话，我建议TTF的下架麻烦也搞快点。

12.02更新:TTF真下架了？那没事了。","After 11 years, this game has finally been removed from the Steam store.

Leaving aside its quality, what was the game's state before it was taken down? Servers were frequently down, and when I posted questions on the EA forums, the community managers were either completely clueless or just offered a few useless ""solutions.""

This removal means that players' unit unlock progress and battle records will be lost. More importantly, since the single-player campaign also requires a constant internet connection to save, even though the story campaign is utterly terrible, experiencing this storyline in the CN Tiberium series will no longer be possible through legitimate channels. The series is currently being presented as a purely multiplayer game, and its unreliability is self-evident.

Now the Steam store page has even removed the multiplayer tag, so it seems EA has voluntarily given up on selling it. If this is EA's attitude, I suggest TTF's removal be done quickly as well.

12.02 Update: TTF really removed? Then it's fine."

​Je savais que ce dernier command and conquer n'était pas fort brillant. Mais, je me devais de le jouer, juste pour l'histoire et revoir le célèbre Kane une dernière fois...

Ça fait longtemps que j'y ai joué, mais, il est tellement présent dans ma mémoire que je me dois d'en faire un commentaire ! 

Ceci est probablement l'un.... si non, le PIRE exemple de la fausse ""bonne idée"" dans l'histoire du jeu video!

A la place d'une base, on a un constructeur mobile.

Le jeu se distingue par un côté pierre/papier/ciseaux prononcé. Qui peut avoir de bons côté, mais est totalement ridicule par moment. Ou des véhicules antichar avec quasi aucun blindage sont capables de résister à des obus en pleine face sans problème.

Bref, un constructeur mobile en tant qu'unique base, et on gagne en multi avec des points de capture, parce qu'on n'a pas de resources à gérer.

C'était sûrement pour rendre le jeu plus nerveux et révolutionner le RTS ???
Non ??? Je pari que c'est EA qui voulait investir le minimum possible. Pas de base, pas d'équilibrage à prévoir. Et jeu accessible à plus grand nombre (les non joueurs de RTS).

Sérieusement, pas de base à construire et à GÉRER ? Ceci est la pire idée qu'ils pouvaient avoir.
Resultat, on vadrouille dans la map à l'aveugle, pour capturer des points de contrôle et éviter si possible d'exposer son seul QG.
En plus, si l'ennemi a construit un build ""contre"" le votre, l'effet pierre/papier/ciseaux très prononcé fait que vous ne pouvez tout simplement pas gagner. On sélectionne toute des unités et les supprime lol. Pour construire un nouveau build. Oui, parce qu'il n'a pas de ressources, juste des points de population. Vous pouvez vous débarrasser de vos unités sans remors.

Les unités aérienne sont OP. Et le QG volant l'est tout autant. Il permet d'éviter indéfiniment les ennemis. Ce qui vous permet jouer au petit parasite toute la partie ! Yay ! Le plaisir !... (oui l'équilibrage de ce jeu est horrible)

Même si on joue la campagne, il faut grinder de l'XP pour déverrouiller des unités. Vous obligeant à rejouer des maps solo. Comme si le jeu n'était pas assez mauvais et inintéressant comme ça...

Le multi était mort dès la première semaine.

Enfin, parlons de l'histoire. Sans grand intérêt, voire stupide. Triste final...
Petit spoil :
Kane utilise le portail alien du 3eme volet pour partir définitivement. Fin, et point final à la saga. Tout ce que vous accomplissez au cours de l'histoire ne sert pas à grand chose. Vous avez servi de garde du corps à Kane et vous activez le portail.
Argggggg ! Et ils sont où les aliens ?

Graphiquement c'est... Euh... Pareil que le 3 ? En moins détaillé ???

Bref ""press F"" pour cette franchise, honteusement humilié et massacrée dans ce C&C 4.
Je pense sur c'est le pire jeu, de ma bibliothèque Steam........ Rien que ça....
Et c'est 20 euros! Vraiment ? A ce prix on a des alternatives bien... Bien... Bien meilleures.

Par conte, je vous conseille sans hésitation le C&C remarsterd. Aussi bien que l'original, avec les cinématiques d'optimisées pour les résolutions actuelles. Le gamplay est veuillo mais toujours excellent,  particulièrement pour un nostalgique qui y a joué à l'époque comme moi 😄
Ne prenez pas le 4, l'une des pires déception de l'histoire. Sa note steam est amplement merité.","I'm a die-hard C&C fan. Yes, I played the very first one back in 1995. It was a revolutionary game in its time. The FMV, the iconic music, the intuitive controls... the cutscenes were magnificent.

I knew this latest Command & Conquer wasn't exactly brilliant. But I had to play it, just for the story and to see the famous Kane one last time...

It's been a long time since I played it, but it's so vivid in my memory that I have to comment!

This is probably one of... if not the WORST example of a ""good idea"" gone wrong in video game history!

Instead of a base, you have a mobile builder.

The game is characterized by a pronounced rock-paper-scissors aspect. Which can have its good points, but is totally ridiculous at times. Or anti-tank vehicles with virtually no armor can withstand direct hits from shells without any problem.

In short, a mobile builder as your sole base, and you win in multiplayer with capture points, because you don't have any resources to manage.

Was this supposed to make the game more fast-paced and revolutionize the RTS genre?

No? I bet it was EA who wanted to invest the bare minimum. No base, no balancing to worry about. And a game accessible to a wider audience (non-RTS players).

Seriously, no base to build and MANAGE? This is the worst idea they could have had.
The result is that you wander around the map blindly, trying to capture control points and avoid exposing your only HQ if possible.
Plus, if the enemy has built a counter to yours, the very pronounced rock-paper-scissors effect means you simply can't win. You select all your units and delete them, lol. To build a new army. Yes, because it has no resources, just population points. You can get rid of your units without remorse.

Air units are OP. And the flying HQ is just as overpowered. It lets you avoid enemies indefinitely. Which allows you to play the little parasite the whole game! Yay! What fun!... (yes, the balancing in this game is awful)

Even if you play the campaign, you have to grind XP to unlock units. Forcing you to replay single-player maps. As if the game wasn't bad and uninteresting enough already...

Multiplayer was dead within the first week.

Finally, let's talk about the story. Uninteresting, even stupid. Sad ending...
Minor spoiler:
Kane uses the alien portal from the third game to leave for good. The end, and that's the end of the saga. Everything you accomplish during the story is pointless. You were Kane's bodyguard and you activate the portal.
Argh! Where are the aliens?

Graphically, it's... Uh... The same as 3? Only less detailed???

In short, a big ""F"" for this franchise, shamefully humiliated and butchered in C&C 4.
I think it's the worst game in my Steam library... That's all...
And it's 20 euros! Really? At that price, you can get much, much, much better alternatives.

However, I wholeheartedly recommend C&C Remastered. Just as good as the original, with cutscenes optimized for current resolutions. The gameplay is old-school but still excellent, especially for a nostalgic gamer who played it back in the day like me 😄
Don't get 4, one of the biggest disappointments in history. Its Steam rating is well deserved."

The mechanics are incredibly stupid; it's not even a strategy, it's some kind of gypsy circus! You just wander around with your base (which is the only building in the game, aside from two cannons and bunkers if you choose the defense module).
There are no decent resources, no familiar buildings. At least nothing is familiar! This isn't C&C. Maybe someone as old as me remembers Strategy Z on the PS1. It's the same, but the maps are much smaller.
The campaign, when played, gives you a complete shambles after the 3rd or 4th mission. It's almost impossible to complete without skill upgrades, and skill upgrades are achieved either by playing the campaign or through long battles in Skirmish mode.
Skirmish mode is a complete bummer. You can't choose a side—it's like GDI, and you can't even stand a chance. Apparently, the ability to play as Nod needs to be unlocked somehow, but damn, this skirmish mode is a lousy one! It's always been like this: choose a map, starting conditions, opponents/allies, and off you go.

-Como C&C es malo, como juego de estrategia también. Y digo ""estrategia"" por decir algo, porque es casi nula. Cada pantalla se basa en un ""toma y daca"" entre tú y la cpu ""defecando"" unidades infinitas sin parar hasta que una aplasta a la otra.

-La historia es la peor de la saga, ya no solo por el sinsentido del argumento si no por lo pésimamente malos que son todos los actores de los vídeos, ni el propio Kane se salva, es su peor papel de lejos. 2 campañas, una larga y la de NOD cortisima que parece un ""pegote"" puesto de relleno y ambas con el mismo final.....

-Tiene ideas que podrían haber sido medio buenas pero si se hubiese planteado de otra forma, lo único salvable es el uso del motor gráfico de Red Alert 3, que este último sin ser perfecto ni mucho menos es bastante mejor juego y más disfrutable.

+Resumiendo: Solo puede interesar a alguien que quiera terminar la saga y saber como se cierra la historia, dejandole el sabor agridulce de lo que podía haber sido y lo que nos han dado. Una lástima ver como esta gran franquicia acabó así de mal.","Weighing the good against the bad, unfortunately, the BAD outweighs the bad.

-As a C&C game, it's bad, and as a strategy game, it's bad too. And I say ""strategy"" loosely, because it's practically nonexistent. Each level is based on a back-and-forth between you and the CPU, endlessly churning out units until one crushes the other.

-The story is the worst in the series, not only because of the nonsensical plot but also because of how terribly bad all the actors are in the cutscenes. Even Kane himself is terrible; it's by far his worst role. Two campaigns: one long and the very short NOD campaign, which feels like an afterthought, and both have the same ending...

-It has ideas that could have been halfway decent, but if they had been implemented differently, the only redeeming feature is the use of the Red Alert 3 graphics engine. While Red Alert 3 isn't perfect by any means, it's a much better and more enjoyable game.

In short: This will only appeal to someone who wants to finish the saga and know how the story concludes, leaving them with a bittersweet feeling of what could have been and what we got instead. It's a shame to see this great franchise end so badly."

94591200,spanish,2021.05.28 19:52,❌,❌,0.5,0,"Contras:
-Te pide iniciar sesión 2 veces en EA, caso contrario no podrás jugar
-El serial puede no funcionarte y hasta podrías tener que instalar Origin para correrlo
-Ya no se arman bases, cosecha tiberio ni existen las bombas nucleares ni cañón de iones
-Ahora cada unidad tiene un tipo de arma y blindaje: si no dispones del arma adecuada para destruir a cierto blindaje, casi que no podrás destruirla (por ej. destruir Mammoths con lásers)
-Las unidades son gratis, se construyen rápido y son limitadas: ahora existe un sistema de puntos parecida a la comida en Warcraft III. Esto provoca que entres en un loop contra el rival donde cada unidad destruida instantáneamente es reemplazada
-Todo se hace desde un Crawler, una base móvil que cae del cielo (literal)
-La campaña tiene 7 misiones por facción y se terminan en 5 horas
-Los Scrin nunca volvieron a pisar la Tierra, a pesar de haber prometido una invasión total
-El hilo argumental no sigue para nada C&C3 ni KW, todo el ejército cyborg de Legión prácticamente no existe
-Su apartado gráfico es inferior a su precuela, con un tono ligeramente caricaturesco
-El diseño de los vehículos es demasiado genérico, casi que no existen unidades míticas de toda la saga más que el Mammoth tank, la nave Venom y la moto de ataque
-Al no haber base, la condición de victoria se reduce a capturar nodos de tiberio, algo así como construir maravillas en Age of Empires pero más aburrido todavía

Pros:","Cons:
- You'll need to log in to EA twice; otherwise, you won't be able to play.
- The serial number might not work, and you might even have to install Origin to run it.
- You can no longer build bases, harvest Tiberium, or use nuclear bombs or ion cannons.
- Now, each unit has a specific weapon type and armor: if you don't have the right weapon to destroy a certain armor, you'll almost certainly be unable to destroy it (e.g., destroying Mammoths with lasers).
- Units are free, quick to build, and limited: there's now a point system similar to the food system in Warcraft III. This causes you to enter a loop against the opponent where every destroyed unit is instantly replaced.
- Everything is done from a Crawler, a mobile base that literally falls from the sky.
- The campaign has 7 missions per faction and can be completed in 5 hours.
- The Scrin never returned to Earth, despite having promised a total invasion.
- The storyline doesn't follow C&C3 or KW at all; the entire cyborg army of Legion is practically nonexistent.
- Its graphics are inferior to its predecessor, with a slightly cartoonish style.
- The vehicle designs are too generic; there are almost no iconic units from the entire saga other than the Mammoth tank, the Venom ship, and the attack bike.
- With no base, the victory condition is reduced to capturing Tiberium nodes, something like building wonders in Age of Empires, but even more boring.

基于种种改变，游戏的玩法也发生了巨大的变化。在本作中则更注重于不同MCV的功能与机动[spoiler]（因为其灵活性差与体型庞大，被称为“王八”也不足为奇）[/spoiler]，并且玩家也需要在人口资源的限制之下决定在不同的时段应该怎样分配单位的生产与作战时的组合，再者就是该怎么利用手上现有的力量来完成升级资源的抢夺或者是达成任务目标等等目的。
由此可见，这一作更注重的是单位与功能的组合与资源分配，并且也大大提升了其网游化的程度，更推崇玩家之间的合作与对抗，尤其在团队对抗时，不同玩家选择不同的MCV也会有不同的分工与搭配，使得游戏性有了质的飞跃。
但是从反向来看，这样的改变也是带来了很多不利因素。头一个就是老派的CNC玩家可不一定认账，从内容上看则是有太多的简化，而且玩法上的差异也并不会让人立马适应而觉得玩起来会很舒服。而且地图的设计也变得更加死板，几乎是清一色的竞技向地图，大大减少初始站位的偶然性，使得其过度电竞化。最大诟病的因素之一就是糟糕的人口限制，虽说在一定程度上抑制了人海堆兵，但也减少了单位组合多样化的可能性，降低了战术尝试过程中带来的容错率。
总的来说，针对如果真的是找不来朋友，或者不能快速适应新模式的玩家来说，这一系列的改动则是失败的。
[h1]【旧碗装新饭】[/h1]
一个[b]“4”[/b]字[spoiler]（宣传视频甚至还给了特写）[/spoiler]可以说是正传的正统延续，但制作组却并没有因此去使用新的引擎，而是沿用了CNC3的老引擎来制作CNC4，所以不论是在界面操作，以及游戏内的操作都透漏着一种没什么进步的感觉，甚至会让玩家觉得这是用旧的东西改出来大型官方模组。一度还夹杂着赶工与减料的嫌疑。
[h1]【平淡却不得不叙说的故事】[/h1]
作为最终章来说，故事内容是合格的，最大的缺点就是短小急促。但因CNC3和《凯恩之怒》的素质就已经摆在那里，所以本作作为最终章能做到这个程度也是实属不易。演员的演技似乎只有凯恩和妻子在线，其他演员略微有些尬演，而GDI司令弄一个黑人大妈来扮演多少有点zzzq的味道，而且整体看来显得相当违和。拍摄布景虽然显得简略，但表演者的镜头感则是相当的不错，也算是对此有另一方面的弥补。
故事依然是GDI 和NOD之间的对抗，但随着全球环境的恶化，人们也不得不在不同的理念中做出抉择。而主角“指挥官”就是其中重要的一位。他曾解救GDI的上司与其一同起义来阻止敌人的野心；也曾为NOD铲除叛党替身凯恩实现升天大计。终于信徒们去往新的世界，而地球也结束了战乱的循环。
如果说伴随着长达15年的陪伴最终要以这一作来画上句号，那应该就是在升天传送门打开时，凯恩对玩家说的那句包含了诸多意义的：
[b]“谢谢你”[/b]。
[h1]不想完全压死这个游戏，只能说：[/h1]
[h1]好玩，但并不耐玩[/h1]

[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/TITLEplayer/recommended/47700]──────────────────────[/url]
EA doubled down on DRM for this game. The first problem I encountered was logging in. When you buy this off Steam, you need to make sure you have an Origin account and register your new cd key on Origin. There are two logins in this game. When you start the game, you start the launcher first and it requires you to enter your Origin credentials. Now there’s another login screen in-game, you will enter the same credentials. HOWEVER, compared to the launcher’s login, if your password is MORE THAN 16 CHARACTERS the game will not log you in. The [b]in-game password field cannot go past 16 characters.[/b] I had to shorten my password, making my account less secure. Now, this game has another problem and it’s a major one.

It appears that the multiplayer features of the game are locked; the servers supporting the multiplayer must have shut down. Attempts to host a lobby will give you an error. [b]There’s no way to know if auto-matching works, but it’s safe to say that all three multiplayer features--lobby hosting, co-op campaign, and auto-matching--do no longer work.[/b]

The only features you have access in this game is the campaign and skirmish against computer AIs. And who knows when this game’s remaining servers, for logging users in, will shut down.

So, if you’re interested in only playing Command and Conquer 4’s story campaign, I recommend you buy it when it is heavily discounted. I got this for $5.

Electronic Arts double downed on DRM for this game, making it always online. Prior to this game’s release, the publisher killed some interesting projects for the franchise. They shutdown Tiberium, a squad-based shooter that takes place after Tiberium Wars that looks like Halo and is a spiritual successor to C&C Renegade. They shut down a sequel to Generals that had a story that sounded similar to Homefront games. Command & Conquer 4’s Tiberium Twilight started its life as an MMO which explains why there is a class and leveling system. The game was forced to be salvaged into a triple AAA rts game, retaining many gameplay mechanics that fans definitely would dislike. Furthermore, they forced the franchise's future games to be browser and mobile games. They killed Generals 2, which is trying to return to its RTS roots.

They tried their best salvaging this game when it started as an MMO and faced heavy pressure from Electronic Arts’s higher ups. There are some bugs, but the production quality is still good. These guys did their best and I wouldn’t fault them.

So I usually supersample the older games I play. Playing on 4k resolution in C&C4 in 1080p monitor is fine. The game looks a little better and sharper, but the cursor does not scale up. It's incredibly tiny, so it's hard to select buttons or icons.

So this is a review of the current state of the game, meaning it will keep in mind that the multiplayer features are unavailable. Out of all the command and conquer games, this one has the worst story and campaigns. It is also very short. The GDI campaign is the worst one, and doesn't really explain the little details that's going on in the story. That's left to the NOD campaign, but is a bit better. Few of the Normal missions are hard to complete because your arsenal will be incomplete, your profile is under-leveled, and you can't play coop with another. You will have to play the campaign twice if you want to complete your arsenal. By then, it would be fun to play the campaign on the hardest difficulty with your full arsenal, but would it be worth the replay though?

This game reminds me of End of Nations and feels like a real slim down version of Red Alert 3. Even some of the unit designs feel as silly as the Red Alert 3's. Take, for example, the scorpion tank between C&C 3 Tiberium Wars and C&C4. In the previous game, it's sleek and looks like it's designed to be fast. In C&C4, it just looks more like a robotic scorpion. Or GDI's wolf tank looks like a little brother of the apocalypse tank.

The crawler system is interesting. You are given three types: offense, defense, and support. It makes the game almost feels like a moba and a beginnings of a MMORTS. Some units would have one or two abilities. Unit commands are carried over from Red Alert 3 and C&C3 Tiberium Wars and this game emphasizes a bit more on micromanagement. Although, I found the max population to be low and wished it was a tad higher. To upgrade, you have to level up your profile and right now, the fastest way is probably through the campaign. In the game, you will need to use your engineers to collect Tiberium crystals to be able to do upgrades (once you unlocked them through leveling). Furthermore, there are buildings that serve as control points which can be captured by your surrounding units. These grant further defense or extend deployment/building area. It feels similar to Dawn of War 2 or Company of Heroes, but worse. The defense crawler will be the closest thing to base building. Support crawler is focused a lot of building aerial units and using support abilities. I think the game shines a bit when you're playing 5 vs 5 with the AI, so you can have different crawlers supporting each other with their different unit compositions. Too bad multiplayer doesn't work anymore.

So as a C&C game, it's the worse but it's better than the recent mobile/browser C&C games. As a RTS game, it's okay.","[b]You only buy this to play the story campaign & when it's discounted, more info below[/b]

It holds almost no connections to the original trilogy gameplay-wise and the overall plot isn't all that well supported. Now if you were looking to play this game without knowing what Command and Conquer is, then you might find some enjoyment in this game. It offers a sort of new concept of a moving base, and is very different from the base building RTS games that everyone is fond of. While the Unit Cap is quite annoying, it's understandable because for many people, commanding a limited amount of units while doing the same with the mobile base is easier than say, 200 units. 

There's a lot wrong with this game, one being that it was supposed to take the mantle of the Tiberium series, but failed catastrophically, and another being that there's many gameplay mechanics that are very dumb, like the unnecessary grind-y element of the game. Who would want to willingly grind out about 10 hours just to get the mastodon, or kodiak? They could have just restricted those unit access in the campaign, not in the Skirmishes. Or take the aformentioned unit cap; I said it was understandable, but that doesn't mean it was a very dumb thing to do. Most of the RTS players are perfectly fine with commanding a very large amount of units, that's the whole appeal of it.

With the story, I genuinely don't think it was alright. I will try not to spoil anything (though I doubt anyone would care even if I did,) but the way the campaign did the cutscenes, just no. I don't hate the actors that had to go through that, it's everything else about it; bland lines, decent-but-not-good enough emotion, the effects were alright, and definitely felt like it was made back in 2010. The story line did match up with the gameplay, but almost none of it made sense when you think about the other games in the franchise. There were plot holes like ""how did GDI magically find a way to fight back against the Tiberium spread?"" or ""For what reason did Kane show the Tacitus to GDI?"" that were never explained, even after pretty much a decade of radio silence. You should really not count this game as being canon to the story, sticking to C&C 3: Tiberium Wars is much better than this.

Fuck EA, selling games you can't even play!

I got a pirated copy and tried out the GDI campaign. The story is mediocre; both sides' stories are similar. The final portal looks like it was just drawn on the wall—so cheap. For grinding experience, you can play 5v5 PvE with four brutal units on your side and two or three on the enemy side. Just try your best; you have more players anyway. The experience is a bit low; it takes three games to level up. Playing the story mode levels you up quickly, but it's a bit difficult. If you can't beat it, try PvE to level up.

The early game is extremely painful, but the experience improves as you level up. The units are quite nice to look at, so it's not bad for killing time. Finally, a couple of points: don't buy it on Steam. Resources are everywhere online. If you can't play it, download all the necessary runtime libraries and try again with your antivirus software off, otherwise the CNC4.dll file might be deleted."

Login twice wasn't an issue to me, the story is just kinda back to zero again if you did played CNC3, however I'am not. Game features of using one unit (crawler) to create units is very enjoyable (able to go mobile, escape, and such). There is co-op on the game, which gave more availability to do campaign a lot easier, or even skirmish together.

AI is just a bit drag to deal with on skirmish. On solo, Easy is actually Medium, FYI the AI on skirmish is actually 1-3 level higher than you (unfair was it?), I'm not even gonna try higher than Medium cuz I lack of hotkeys and multitasking (need lots of practice).

# 꿀잼 3가지
1. 전혀 다른 게임 시스템: 기존의 전략 시뮬이랑은 많이 다른 새로운 시스템
2. 캐주얼한 게임 플레이: 거기다 친절히 유닛 상성까지도 보여주어서 좋음
3. 나쁘지 않은 그래픽: 2020년에도 꽤 봐줄만 한 그래픽

# 노잼 3가지
1. 자원이 없음: 자원이 없기 때문에 전략적인 면이 많이 없어지고 유닛이 별로 아깝지가 않다
2. 개성없는 유닛들: 기존의 C&C의 개성 넘치는 유닛이 없어지고 다 비슷비슷하게 보임
3. 유닛 생성 제한되어있는 게임 시스템: 전략 시뮬인데도 불구하고 레벨을 올려야지만 유닛을 뽑을 수 있는 이상한 시스템

# 총평
모바일 게임 C&C 라이벌의 토대가 된 듯한 시스템이 많이 보인다. 좋게 말하면 시대를 앞서간 게임이라 할 수 있겠다. 기존 C&C와 일반적인 전략 시뮬레이션이라고 생각하지 않고 플레이하길 추천","Thanks for the Korean support!

# 3 Fun Things
1. Completely Different Game System: A new system that's quite different from existing strategy simulators.
2. Casual Gameplay: It's great because it even shows unit compatibility.
3. Decent Graphics: Even in 2020, the graphics are quite acceptable.

# 3 Boring Things
1. No Resources: Because there are no resources, the strategic aspect is largely lost, and units are not worth spending much on.
2. Uninspired Units: The unique units of existing C&Cs are gone, and they all look similar.
3. Limited Unit Creation: Despite being a strategy simulator, the system requires leveling up to unlock units.

# Overall Review
Many of the systems seem to be the foundation of the mobile game C&C Rivals. To put it bluntly, it's a game ahead of its time. I recommend playing it without thinking of it as a typical strategy simulation or C&C."

Экономическую составляющую в игре полностью убрали вместо ресурсов у вас командные очки которые ограничивают вас в наборе юнитов. 10 юнитов всё - очков командования у вас нет поэтому идите нафиг и воюйте этими 10 юнитами! Сидишь задрачиваешь этот 1 отряд из 10 юнитов... За тиберий, который кстати надо еще до зоны высадки дотащить, используется в качестве улучшения ваших юнитов. На последних этапах игры когда вы всё прокачали тиберий вам больше не нужон и все что вы имеете в игре это ваш долбанный жук и ваш отряд с 10 юнитами. Игра что на высокой сложности что на низкой одинакова и собственно вопрос ""а в чем прикол?"" Типа у вас есть выбор, но от этого выбора у вас ничего не зависит. Кстати компания проходится за 3-5 часов, а их там 2. Чтобы разблокировать весь контент вы должны набрать кучу опыта на 1 фракцию по 15-20 часов дрочни одними и теми же юнитами. Итого игра с 2 фракциями у вас на 40 часов максимум дальше в игре делать нечего. Соревновательного интереса в игре как такового нет из-за вырезанной экономики все что вы можете это спамить юнитами. ВОТ ВСЯ ЭТА ИГРА ВОТ СВОДИТСЯ К ОДНОМУ ЛОГИЧНОМУ ВЫВОДУ - ""ДРОЧНЯ ЮНИТАМИ"" которых между прочим аж целых 10 штук. Пасьянс и то интереснее будет... Не тратьте время на нее","The game is terrible! There's no base building, the units are all the same type, and you can't tell them apart when they're all crammed together. The graphics have dropped a notch compared to the previous game. The plot is pathetic, taking up half a page in 3-4 sentences. You're given a choice between two factions, and the one you choose determines the ending. They've removed the screenshots from C&C 4; you won't even see a hint of them in the game. The battles are boring and uninteresting! You have three MSCs to choose from, and they're all unbalanced! The game outside of the campaign is disgusting and looks like this: two beetles sit down and stare at each other to see who can outspammed whom. The economic component has been completely removed from the game; instead of resources, you have command points, which limit your unit selection. 10 units is all you have—you have no command points, so go and fight with those 10 units! You're sitting there, grinding away at that one squad of 10 units... Tiberium, which, by the way, you still have to get to the landing zone, is used to upgrade your units. In the later stages of the game, when you've maxed out everything, you no longer need Tiberium, and all you have is your damn beetle and your squad with 10 units. The game is the same on both hard and easy difficulties, and the question is, ""What's the point?"" It's like you have a choice, but that choice doesn't affect you. By the way, the campaign takes 3-5 hours, and there are two of them. To unlock all the content, you have to gain a ton of experience with one faction, grinding away at the same units for 15-20 hours. So, playing with two factions gives you a maximum of 40 hours of nothing to do. There's no real competitive edge to the game because of the cut economy; all you can do is spam units. THIS WHOLE GAME BOTTOM LINES UP TO ONE LOGICAL CONCLUSION - ""UNIT WANKING,"" of which there are, by the way, as many as 10. Solitaire would be more interesting... Don't waste your time on it."

游戏玩法部分也特别奇怪，变成了一个容易卡人口的刷兵游戏，一开始选择几种不同的基地多余的不行，从三代过来的表示完全一脸懵，基础运营和玩法完全变成了其他方向，玩起来特别变扭难受。

不想多说了，糟糕透顶！ 还是玩3代吧。。。。。","Not to mention the activation code that required reactivation from EA, the numerous dice rolls and failed registration attempts, this game simply can't compare to NOD3. As a game artist, I have some standards for mecha design, but setting aside other aspects, the art style alone is utterly terrible. The only redeeming quality might be the improved cinematics, perhaps because they invested all their money in live-action performances. Returning to the mecha and unit design, a few perfectly good machines are crammed with a bunch of glowing bars, making the units look like a bunch of cheap plastic toys. The realism of NOD3 is completely gone, leaving me extremely disappointed. NOD's units are also absurd, crammed with gothic elements or something, incredibly low-quality, especially some of the aerial units—are they not toys? They're downright ugly. And the UI is equally tacky, especially the victory and defeat icons—what kind of cheap, low-budget effects are those?! Where did the cool 3D rotating logo go?

The gameplay is also incredibly strange. It's become a unit-farming game where you easily get stuck with limited population. Starting with several different bases is ridiculously difficult. Having come from the third installment, I'm completely bewildered. Basic management and gameplay have been completely rewritten, making it incredibly awkward and frustrating to play.

I don't want to say more, it's absolutely terrible! I'll stick to the third installment..."

1. Строительство - то что я любил в этой серии - его нет. Я разочаровался в ЕА именно тогда, 10 лет назад.
2. Графика 3 части в разы лучше, чем в 4й. словно создателей сменили, расстреляли, обoccали и изнacиловали. Именно в таком порядке. А на их место поставили людей, которые занимались разработкой мобильных игр.
3. Система баланса - ненужная чушь. Раньше ты строил базу и мог балансировано распределять игру под свою тактику. а сейчас ты просто выбираешь одну из трех систем танка, и воюй всю игру. Благо сменить можно во время игры, но удручает перестройка.
4. Концовку оставили открытой, но я просто не представляю какую наркоманию можно приплести к сюжету. Для меня игра кончилась на третьей части.
5. Каждый раз, чтобы войти в игру, надо вводить логин и пароль к серверам ЕА. Это неправильно как по мне. Игра забывает меня каждый чертов раз.","I liked the game solely for the story. However, there are many downsides:
1. Construction—what I loved in this series—is gone. I became disillusioned with EA right then, 10 years ago.
2. The graphics in Part 3 are vastly better than in Part 4. It's as if the creators were replaced, shot, pissed on, and raped. In that order. And in their place, they installed people who developed mobile games.
3. The balance system is unnecessary nonsense. Previously, you built a base and could balance the game according to your tactics, but now you just choose one of three tank systems and fight the entire game. Fortunately, you can change them during the game, but the restructuring is depressing.
4. They left the ending open, but I simply can't imagine what kind of drug addiction could be woven into the plot. For me, the game ended with Part 3.
5. Every time I want to log in to the game, I have to enter my username and password for the EA servers. This is just not right for me. The game forgets me every damn time."

-Кампания интересна как в старые добрые времена с живыми актерами,сюжетными поворотами и тд и тп.
-Игра отказалась от стандартной механики снс-тоесть база с ресурсами и прочим.Чем взорвала не хило так жопу фанатам. БЛИАДЬ А ГДЕ ТИБЕРИУМ? где харвестеры?как тут какать?.Да соглашусь в корне менять механики для номерной части это плохо.НО .но,с новой механикой играть то интересно,игра то дарит новый опыт отличаемый от классического я строю электростанцию,я выхожу в казармы я строю ресурсник и параллельно пару солдат.Типичный дебют в ртс(стандартные действия для каждой партии) убираются сразу тут можно с розгона в карьер.Игра стала более динамичной не дающее игрокам сидеть в обороне.Интересная механика с профилями армии.Атака-Защита-Поддержка.Это все не обычно но интересно.Но это сыграло с игрой злую шутку,большинство комьюнити бомбануло,не разобралось и похоронило игру а вместе с ней и серию.Класс.
-Но кроме спорных моментов игра себе сама выстрелила пару раз в ногу.
1)Фракции,их всего две.В стратегии в 2010.Да разрабы после 2003 поняли что ртс на 2 фракции гивно и начали пилить на 3.Даже в 2 и 3 сс были забытые и скрины.А тут что?НОД ГДИ-нейтральная постройка с 3 типами юнитов забытых.ВСЕ.А где 3 фракция?Нельзя было сделать тех же скриннов или забытых сделать полноценной игровой фракцией?Или кого то новых?Например людей которых заипла грызня между гсб и нод и они создали свою фракцию под названием-как меня это все надоело пойду вломаю по роже всем кто воюет (я образно).А тут 2 фракции.Да юнитов много но 2 фракции?Але?В стар варс емпаир эт вор в аддоне 3 было.
2)Открытие юнитов за опыт.Ну тут гениально,я покупаю ртс а получаю открытие юнитов (способностей) как в ММО.Аху,я в шоке.Как бы ЕА ты кто такой *собака женского рода* чтоб это дело? Какого *полового органа* я должен юниты открывать в пвп\пве и кампании? У вас диллер есть .... Вы юниты в киосках покупаете?Вы во что играете? Вы что мудилы?Да при помощи не совсем честных методов можно открыть все юниты для всех 2 фракций часа за 4.НО ЗАЧЕМ? Я понимаю там выбивать достижения или шкурки...НО ЮНИТЫ В ПЛАТНОй ИГРЕ?????
Вердикт такой-дайте игре шанс,если вы раньше не смотрели самое время изза дефицита жанра ртс посмотреть на игру.
Это как стремная баба и бутылка водки,после бутылки водки стремная баба не такая уж стремная.А у нас 2020 и жан ртс.
В 2020 СнС 4 не такая уж плохая игра.","Phew, it's hard to talk about SNS4, but we'll start with two things.
1) How to play?
Yes, the community has a big problem with just launching the game. Here's the instruction.
Buy the game, copy the activation key the first time you launch it, or copy it manually. Log in to your Origin account (or create a new one if you don't have one). Add the game to your account. Insert the key. Link SNS4 to your Origin account. Close Origin. Launch SNS4 through Steam. Enter your username and password in the launcher. Create a new SNS4 player profile. Log in to the game. Enter your username and password again. You can play without any hassle and with LIVE online.
2) Why? Because RTS is so fucked up in 2020 that SNS4 is a good RTS. Yeah, the game is a fucking mess, but there are no questions. - It's fun to play.
- There's a co-op campaign.
- It's live for 2020 online.
- The campaign is as interesting as the good old days, with live actors, plot twists, and so on.
- The game has abandoned the standard SNS mechanics—that is, a base with resources and such. Which has really blew fans' minds. WHERE'S THE FUCK IS TIBERIUM? Where are the harvesters? How can I even say shit here? Yes, I agree that completely changing the mechanics for the numbered unit is bad. BUT, the new mechanics are interesting to play, and the game offers a new experience different from the classic one: I build a power plant, I go to the barracks, I build a resource tank, and at the same time, I build a couple of soldiers. The typical RTS opening (standard actions for each game) is immediately removed; here you can go from strength to strength. The game has become more dynamic, preventing players from sitting on the defensive. Interesting mechanics with army profiles: Attack-Defense-Support. It's all unusual, but interesting. But this played a cruel joke on the game; most of the community got mad, didn't understand it, and buried the game and, along with it, the series. Cool.
- But besides the controversial issues, the game shot itself in the foot a couple of times. 1) Factions, there are only two. In the strategy game in 2010. Yes, after 2003, the developers realized that RTS with 2 factions was crap and started making it 3. Even in SS 2 and 3, there were forgotten units and screenshots. And what's here? NOD GDI is a neutral building with 3 types of forgotten units. THAT'S IT. Where's the 3rd faction? Couldn't they have made the same screenshots or made the forgotten ones a full-fledged playable faction? Or someone new? For example, people who got fed up with the squabble between GSB and NOD and created their own faction called ""I'm so sick of this, I'm going to punch everyone who fights"" (figuratively speaking). And here there are 2 factions. Yes, there are a lot of units, but 2 factions? Hello? In Star Wars, there was an Empire vs. Thief expansion pack, 3. 2) Unlocking units with experience. This is brilliant! I buy RTS and get unlocked units (abilities) like in an MMO. Aha, I'm shocked. EA, who the hell are you, a *female dog*, to even think of this? What *genital organ* am I supposed to unlock units in PvP/PvE and the campaign with? Do you have a dealer? Do you buy units from kiosks? What are you playing? Are you idiots? Yes, using less-than-honest methods, you can unlock all units for all two factions in about 4 hours. BUT WHY? I understand earning achievements or skins... BUT UNITS IN A PAID GAME?????
The verdict is: give the game a chance. If you haven't tried it before, it's high time you gave it a try due to the shortage of RTS games. It's like a creepy woman and a bottle of vodka. After the bottle of vodka, the creepy woman isn't so creepy. And we're in 2020 and RTS.
In 2020, SnS 4 isn't such a bad game."

1.相较RA，将军和其他泰伯，游戏模式变化太大了，人口限制这一改动在我看来直接杀死这游戏，而且建筑，技能，部队分开来搞，本意吧，我猜是加强团队合作，降低操作难度，可实际上战斗节奏太快，5V5一打团人都找不到了。
2.游戏模式太单一，玩起来太累，还要升级解锁单位，20级前对面AI压你等级，肝死。
3.剧情这。。。太草率了
但不得不说，这个游戏在渲染，模型和BGM方面做的很良心（Nod的战斗音乐上头）
哎。。。CNC系列就这么烂尾说实话真的难受，期待将来RA2和CNC2重做（将军有生之年能见到重做吧）","I first bought it in 2016 when I reached level 20 on both GDI and Nod. If it weren't for revisiting those memories and this recent price drop, I wouldn't have bought it again. Here are my reasons:

1. Compared to Ragnarok Online (RA), Generals, and other Tiberium games, the game mode changes drastically. The population cap, in my opinion, killed the game. Furthermore, separating buildings, skills, and units, while intended to enhance teamwork and reduce difficulty, results in a very fast-paced battle. In 5v5 battles, you can't even find anyone.

2. The game mode is too repetitive and tiring. Upgrading and unlocking units, coupled with AI pressure before level 20, makes it incredibly grindy.

3. The story... is too rushed.

However, I must say, the game's rendering, models, and BGM are excellent (Nod's battle music is addictive).

Sigh... it's really disappointing that the CNC series ended so poorly. I hope RA2 and CNC2 will be remade in the future (I hope I can see a remake of Generals in my lifetime)."

75393680,russian,2020.08.04 01:15,❌,❌,0.7213765383,28,"Мне очень сильно хотелось, чтобы это была настоящая часть серии, а не левый суррогат, который в последний момент решили немного подкрасить и попытаться выдать за чистую монету. Я несколько раз начинал в нее играть, и даже почти прошел. Я надеялся разглядеть в ней хоть какую-то ценность, подвергая сомнению всю критику. И у меня не получилось. Единственное, что в этой игре бесспорно круто – это главное меню. Я залипал в него каждый раз, когда запускал игру. Оно излучает обещания пафоса и эпичности, и когда ты видишь его в первый раз, то не повестись невозможно. Кажется, что вот оно – невероятное и долгожданное приключение в любимой вселенной. Но хуй там плавал, к сожалению.

Иронично, что большинство критики таки оказалось вкусовщиной. Однако в каждом случае я все равно приходил к выводу, что игра говно. Например, все говорят, что персонажи плохие и никто не запоминается, кроме Кейна, и что актерская игра плохая и сюжет тупой. Это только отчасти правда. Я не знаю, куда люди смотрели, но актерская игра в роликах очень хорошая. Они стараются, и это ясно видно. А вот сами роли – плохие.

Или, например, фанаты серии ругают мультяшность графики, хотя в ней нет вообще ничего плохого. Я бы даже сказал, что она крутая. И эффекты сделаны очень красиво. А вот дизайны юнитов – это пиздец. Большую часть игры на экране какие-то коробки либо на колесах, либо летающие, которые с первого взгляда очень непросто отличить друг от друга. При этом некоторые отдельные юниты выглядят очень классно. Например, мотоциклы, стелс танки и шагоходы. Но все это теряется на фоне заполоняющих коробов, особенно у ГДИ.

И сам геймплей тоже обругали, главным образом за то, что нельзя строить базу. По-моему, эта игра вышла слишком рано, а разработчики, в свою очередь, опередили время. И практически предсказали тренд компьютерных игр на десятилетие вперед. Но ни аудитория не была готова, ни сами разработчики не были готовы сделать это правильно. Мне кажется, что если бы она выходила сегодня, то с некоторыми поправками такая моба-стратегия могла бы и выстрелить. Я был бы более чем не против поиграть в такую игру сейчас, если бы ее сделали с прицелом на конкурента доты, лольца и прочих овервотчей.

P.S. Финальный ролик – ебаный пиздец. Просто ебаный стыд. Очень дешево и всрато одновременно.","I really wanted this to be a true installment in the series, not a last-minute imitation that they'd tweaked and tried to pass off as genuine. I tried to play it several times, and even almost finished it. I hoped to find some value in it, questioning all the criticism. And I failed. The only thing undeniably cool about this game is the main menu. I was glued to it every time I launched it. It exudes a promise of pathos and epicness, and when you see it for the first time, it's impossible not to fall for it. It seems like this is it—an incredible and long-awaited adventure in a beloved universe. But unfortunately, it was a complete failure.

It's ironic that most of the criticism turned out to be a matter of taste. However, in each case, I still came to the conclusion that the game is crap. For example, everyone says the characters are bad and no one is memorable except Kane, and that the acting is bad and the plot is dumb. This is only partially true. I don't know what people were looking at, but the acting in the cutscenes is very good. They're trying hard, and it's clearly visible. But the performances themselves are bad.

Or, for example, fans of the series criticize the cartoonish graphics, although there's nothing wrong with them at all. I'd even say they're cool. And the effects are very beautifully done. But the unit designs are a disaster. Most of the game shows boxes on screen, either on wheels or flying, which are very difficult to distinguish from each other at first glance. That said, some individual units look really cool, like motorcycles, stealth tanks, and walkers. But all of this gets lost in the background of the overflowing boxes, especially in GDI.

And the gameplay itself has also been criticized, mainly for the inability to build a base. In my opinion, this game came out too early, and the developers, in turn, were ahead of their time. They practically predicted the trend in computer games for a decade to come. But neither the audience was ready, nor the developers themselves were ready to do it right. I think if it were released today, such a MOBA strategy game could have been a success with a few tweaks. I'd be more than willing to play such a game now if it were made with an eye toward competing with Dota, LoL, and other Overwatch games.

P.S. The final trailer is fucking awful. It's just fucking disgraceful. It's cheap and completely fucked up at the same time."

...I was warned.
You only have 50 command points, which, while they may seem like a lot, actually only allow you to have about 8 units. The gameplay is boring to say the least, and... there's an account leveling system to unlock everything you can build in a game, even though in the single-player campaign you can fight tier 3 mechs while still using tier 1 soldiers. Highly not recommended."

说实话这是CNC系列游戏体验最差的一款了，EA的创新不仅没有给CNC带来新生反而给CNC的棺材钉上了最后一颗钉子。
说这款一无是处的话是十分不公平的。单位设计与模型很棒；进攻、防御、支援的设计也还可以；如果抛去及其垃圾的剧情和CNC续作的滤镜来看的话至少是一款勉强及格的游戏。以上就是所有我能挑出来的优点了。
至于该游戏的缺点，包括但不限于过少的人口，体验极差的遭遇战，不知道是谁脑袋一热想出来的升级解锁单位，这都给这个游戏带来了极差的游戏体验，再加上食屎级的剧情，造就了CNC历史上最差的作品。
及其不推荐购买，即使是抱着试一试的心态也不要买，你会后悔的","After much deliberation, I still gave it a bad review.

To be honest, this is the worst game in the CNC series. EA's innovations haven't given CNC a new lease on life; instead, they've driven the final nail into its coffin.

Saying it's completely worthless is extremely unfair. The unit design and models are great; the attack, defense, and support systems are also decent; if you ignore the extremely poor storyline and the CNC sequel bias, it's at least a barely passable game. These are all the positives I can find.

As for the game's flaws, they include, but are not limited to, the extremely limited population, the terrible skirmishes, and the upgrade-to-unlock unit system that seemed to come up with on a whim. All of these contribute to a terrible gaming experience, coupled with the utterly awful storyline, making it the worst CNC game ever.

I strongly advise against buying it, even if you're just trying it out. You'll regret it."

[/list]

В итоге: рекомендую всем кто готов забыть о привычном базостроечном стиле игры предыдущих частей.","Honestly, I don't understand why everyone criticized this game... I really liked it. Yes, this part of C&C is completely different from the previous games. Yes, the developers completely abandoned the usual resource gathering and base building. But this didn't detract from the quality of the game one bit.

[list]
[*] As always, excellent cinematic cutscenes between missions;
[*] New, interesting gameplay built around different types of crawlers;
[*] Very beautiful graphics;
[*] And many other advantages.
[/list]

In conclusion: I recommend it to anyone ready to abandon the familiar base-building style of the previous games."

67852855,russian,2020.03.23 07:35,❌,✅,0.5238095522,1,"Минусы: 1. Сюжет слабый, особенно концовка (да, их там несколько, но по факту, одна и та же). Персонажи убогие. Даже Кейна подпортили, как по мне. Хотя Джо Кукан всё еще играет отлично. Никогда не забуду Кейна предыдущих частей. 2. Игра не стоит своих денег. Я за Red Alert 3 готов отдать 999 рублей, а вот за такую короткую, да и можно сказать, сделанную на коленке игру, 1к это перебор. 3. Мертвый мультиплеер (то-ли из-за серверов, то-ли из-за мертвого онлайна, хз). 4. Обесценивание юнитов и построек. Раньше, вы ценили юниты и постройки из-за того, что вы на них тратили большое количество денег. Это очень сказывалось на динамике игры в положительную сторону. Сейчас же это убрали. Вам вообще будет наплевать на юнитов. Потеряли - сделали новых. Это полностью уничтожает разнообразие и динамику. Зачем это сделали? Непонятно. (5). Перевод. Перевод убогий. Например: кому, наxеp, пришла в голову идея о переименовании ГСБ в ГДИ?????. Для тех, кто не в теме, поясню: GDI это Global Defense Initiative, что можно перевести как Глобальный Совет Безопасности. А ГДИ это что? Я даже предполагать не буду. Озвучка посредственная, видно что вообще не старались.  Просто позвали самых заезженных актеров на озвучку, которые просто читают текст. Только Кейн и Жена ГГ озвучены нормально. 6. Защита от взлома. Наличие DRM, постоянное подключение к интернету и необходимость иметь аккаунт EA. (7). Музыка. Не знаю почему, но мне вообще не зашло. Какие-то звездные войны, а не C&C.
() - субъективный или относящийся к определенной версии игры

Плюсы:
Их нет, к сожалению","Cons: 1. The plot is weak, especially the ending (yes, there are several, but essentially, they're the same). The characters are pathetic. Even Kane was ruined, in my opinion. Although Joe Kukan still plays great. I'll never forget Kane from the previous games. 2. The game isn't worth the money. I'm ready to pay 999 rubles for Red Alert 3, but for such a short, and one might even say, hastily made game, 1k is too much. 3. Dead multiplayer (either because of the servers or because of the dead online, I don't know). 4. Devaluation of units and buildings. Previously, you valued units and buildings because you spent a lot of money on them. This greatly impacted the dynamics of the game in a positive way. Now they removed this. You won't care about units at all. They lost them - they made new ones. This completely destroys the variety and dynamism. Why did they do this? It's unclear. (5). Translation. The translation is poor. For example: who the hell came up with the idea to rename GDI to GDI????? For those who don't know, GDI stands for Global Defense Initiative, which can be translated as Global Security Council. And what is GDI? I won't even guess. The voice acting is mediocre; it's clear they didn't try at all. They simply hired the most overused voice actors who simply read the text. Only Kane and the main character's wife are voiced properly. 6. Hacking protection. DRM, constant internet connection, and the need for an EA account. (7). Music. I don't know why, but I didn't like it at all. It feels like Star Wars, not C&C.

人口上限和画风软化我都能接受，隔壁星际一样有人口上限，人家依然有很好的体验；红警3画风比这个更Q，但我也表示很喜欢。结果EA直接度改成成了英雄连4，RTS 的基础结构直接给整没了，EASB这么NB你咋不去收购水雷？

I could accept the population cap and softened art style; StarCraft also has a population cap, and the experience is still great. Red Alert 3 has a cuter art style, but I still liked it. EA just turned it into Company of Heroes 4, completely destroying the fundamental structure of an RTS. If EASB is so powerful, why didn't they just acquire Minesweeper?

The terrible pathfinding and collision detection are still there. A single unit can walk through a group, and the rest of the units will immediately scatter in panic. This is a stark contrast to StarCraft 2, which came out in the same year.

The plot suddenly became mysterious, starting to veer towards mindlessly whitewashing Nod. Few of the mysteries left from the third installment have been solved.

PS: According to some experts, this fourth installment was rushed by EA, who packaged the spin-off Command & Conquer: Arena as a sequel, turning a perfectly good RTS into a chaotic free-for-all. EASB is done for."

A little backstory behind the game, this was going to be a standalone game set in its own universe that's completely separate from the Command and Conquer universe. Early on during the project, the brilliant executives at EA thought they would make more money from the game if they slapped the Command and Conquer logo on it and based it within the Tiberian universe. So the devs were pretty much forced to turn a game that was never intended to be a Command and Conquer game into Command and Conquer 4. 

The result? An absolute mess. Plays nothing like any of the Command and Conquer games. There's really no economy or base building, it's just mindless unit spamming until you win. I completed the GDI and Nod campaigns and then immediately uninstalled -- never to play again. The story is terrible, by the way.

62399603,russian,2020.00.25 22:39,❌,✅,0.6853628755,36,"Безусловно, это худшая часть серии C&C. Даже Джозеф Кукан (он же Кейн) своей актерской игрой не смог вытащить этот геймплейно провальный кусок кода. Однако, в 2014 году, я купил диск с этой игрой в одном из магазинов. Целиком ее прошел. Несмотря на низкий рейтинг игры, я получил от нее какое-то удовольствие. Можно много говорить о том, что EA козлины, сделали всё возможное для слива игры, которая превратилась натурально в Halo Wars. Но даже этот слив, который с натяжкой можно назвать ПК RTS, остался у меня в душе приятными воспоминаниями.

Но EA не были бы EA если бы не накосячили даже с релизом в стиме. На стадии предзаказа игры, всем, сделавшим предзаказ, была доступна миссия НОД Night Moves, где под руководством Гидеона нужно было угнать три транспорта, а потом уничтожить краулеры ГДИ. Так вот. 2019 год, на момент покупки игры. Покупаю игру за свои деньги, а этой миссии НЕТ. Прошло 9 лет с релиза игры. ТАК КАКОГО ЧЕРТА НА ПИРАТСКОЙ БОЛВАНКЕ ЗА 150 РУБЛЕЙ ОНА БЫЛА, А В ЛИЦЕНЗИОННОЙ ВЕРСИИ УЖЕ СПУСТЯ 9 ЧЕРТОВЫХ ЛЕТ ВЫ НЕ ДАЛИ ДОСТУП К ЭТОЙ МИССИИ ВСЕМ???? КАКОГО ХРЕНА??? Это была одна из моих любимых миссий, плюс за нее давали максимум 4к опыта, что доп прокачка. А теперь ее тупо нет. Красавцы.","This is undoubtedly the worst game in the C&C series. Even Joseph Kukan (aka Kane) couldn't save this gameplay disaster with his acting. However, in 2014, I bought a copy of this game from a store. I finished it entirely. Despite the game's low rating, I did enjoy it to some extent. You can talk a lot about how EA are jerks, doing everything possible to dump the game, which naturally turned into Halo Wars. But even this dump, which can hardly be called a PC RTS, remains a fond memory for me.

But EA wouldn't be EA if they didn't screw up even the Steam release. When pre-ordering the game, everyone who pre-ordered had access to the NOD mission ""Night Moves,"" where, under Gideon's leadership, they had to hijack three transports and then destroy GDI crawlers. So, that's the year 2019, when I purchased the game. I bought the game with my own money, and this mission is NOT there. It's been 9 years since the game's release. SO WHY THE HELL WAS IT ON A PIRATED FILM FOR 150 RUBLES, AND IN THE LICENSED VERSION, 9 FUCKING YEARS LATER, YOU HAVEN'T GAVE EVERYONE ACCESS TO THIS MISSION???? WHAT THE HELL???

https://myaccount.ea.com/cp-ui/redemption/index
 完成后即可正常游玩，王八竞技场本质是像R6S一样的买断制网游
（不需要下载烂橘子）
老实说，王八竞技场没有想象的那么烂
[b]1.画面：7.5/10[/b]
不少人都在喷画面还不如CC3好，学RA3的卡通风格，确实如此，RA系一直是比较偏向“政治玩笑”“黑色幽默”性的游戏，使用卡通画风其实很多人都是可以接受的，但CC正传系从1代起构架的世界观一直都相对起来想向严谨一点的方向走，这么看起来确实别扭了一点。当然我觉得画面并不都全是缺点，这一代的模型更科幻一点，帅就完事了[strike]然而单位需要肝就很气[/strike]，其次至少CC4没有太过分的光污染（护盾亮度还能接受，要说的话就是火鹰空袭挺亮的，但是ra3换个黄色阵营色感觉整个人都要瞎了），而且单位细节也还可以，但也只是可以的程度（泰坦吃蓝核变猫耳还挺可爱的），个人觉得，总体还是差强人意，没有什么喷的那么过

[b]2.游戏性：5.5/10[/b]
要说他没劲，但是总会莫名其妙就玩上了，说他有劲的话，我还真找不出来哪好玩
怎么玩？很简单
你可以选择闹得或者鸡呆，选择自己的王八种类，分为走地王八（攻击&防御）和飞天王八（支援），而走地王八中还分为了四足王八和履带王八，你的最终目标是占领地图上的王八窝来夺取分数，当然也可以比较激进的去干翻敌人的王八，也可以
同时场上有时会有人投食萝卜，你可以让你的单位去争夺萝卜带回自己的王八沙滩，可以带来一定的升级点数来让自己的王八变得更♂强
正经点好了，先说这一代的较大改变：
1.GDI和Nod不再可以混编，如果你选择的阵营是GDI那么你的队伍必须全都是GDI。
2.不能偷鸡了，就是说双科技不再存在
3.所有的生产建筑集中于MCV上，不再单独建造
4.部分单位的改动，如斗牛犬从反装甲变成了反轻型单位，毒液从反步兵变成了反中型飞行器
5.老生常谈人口上限，并且没了经济，唯一的资源采集是偷泰矿升级（游戏中引导不好，采集泰矿之后运回自己颜色的网格状地形基地后方可获得点数）
主要还是这些，都说怕是说到明年，游戏上我也不能评判出来是不是有意思，首先游戏里杀伤力低的出奇（遭遇战可以改）尤其是镭射伤害打步兵特别感人，反制很死板，几乎就是个石头剪刀布，当然只娱乐也不是不能框框A，火炮伤害打轻中还行，重甲也能看（会有点小吃瘪）不考虑防空直接爆猎手和复仇者就行了，死板这算是第一个减分点吧
第二嘛，这个EA当初自己宣传的时候就说了，这一代拥有最多的玩具，前提是你够肝。遭遇战效率低，战役因为科技不全肯定会吃亏，如果单刷一关战役多多少少会破坏掉剧情体验，当然在线模式也能得到经验但是这游戏虽然有人玩但是匹配得到算我输
但是也不用特别担心，只要按剧情走拥有的军备是完全可以走完全流程的，不需要刻意刷满级，虽然这么说但是有单位不让用心里也挺恼火的
第三我不知道算不算缺点，我本来以为这一代没了采集建设应该会更简单，但是没想到其实是更难了 
首先因为这个死板的克制，队伍构成和单位配合变得尤为重要，其次需要占领多个目标，不玩多线操作是不行的
这也就代表了这个游戏的门槛，之前有RTS或RTT经验的人还好，但萌新会被百分之一万的劝退
开始玩着可能觉得还不错，但通关就腻了
啊对了顺便一说，本来是想抱着对开发者的最基本的敬意看完制作人员名单，没想到不止画面是重复的连名单都是tm循环播放

说第三点之前插几句，既然是CNC那怎么少的了批斗EASB的环节呢
本身这个游戏原名是 命令与征服：竞技场，一个网游性质的外传，但因为EA对EALA制作组的低效率感到不满，要求制作CNC正传恰烂钱，但时间完全不充裕（据说不足一年）开发是完全不可能的，于是将竞技场包装成了泰伯利亚黄昏
CC4中不少可以看的到赶工的痕迹，后面剧情方面也会稍微谈一些

但最大的错就在于你身为一个收官作明知自己只有死忠粉才会玩的情况下出了一个RTT游戏

P.S. 这作平衡并不好，加上死板的克制导致你即使全力了想带几个丢人ai也很难扳回局势，你拼了老命攻占来的节点赚到的那一点分可能还不如ai队友往对方老家送死了好几台猛犸带残骸丢的分多

3.剧情：5/10

以下情节包含剧透

终于到了最重要的环节了，CC正传的灵魂之一摆在这，也是王八竞技场的最大槽点，以下分析不喜勿喷
首先最大的吃书点是茄子咕咕咕了，说好的要来报复人类结果影子都没看见一个

尊王：地球的臭弟弟们爷来辣，吔我黄金舰队
茄子AI：正在链接服务器 地球 确认吗？
尊王：确认，搞快点
茄子AI：无法链接至EA服务器，请检查您的网线是否已拔出
尊王：QNMD，丝巾科技天下第一，搁这看不起谁呢
茄子AI：连接超时，正在返航
尊王：？？？？？

除此之外仍然有其他待解释的bug，比如全世界已不存在黄区蓝区，包括GDI总部莫名其妙都遭到了泰伯利亚的污染（zocom：摸了）而全世界剩下的唯一还能控制的污染区只有巴黎（我看今天谁敢乳法.jpg）但也产生了一些个人想法，希望各位可以积极指正或补充

1.GDI才是最大反派？CC4为nod洗白？
个人感觉没有这种说法
GDI的主观目的在于彻底净化这颗星球，而Nod的目的则是协助凯恩完成""升天""
最终的结局这么一看其实是双赢，只不过[b]GDI的胜利建立于Nod的胜利之上[/b]
洗白其实也说不上，CC里也并没有传统欧美爽片里的明确善恶观念，GDI不一定代表正义，Nod也不一定代表邪恶，但说真的我感觉王八竞技场的Nod结局才是正统结局

2.游戏中各个派系的关系？
游戏中大致有4个派系，[b]李奥斯领导的GDI理事会，詹姆斯旗下的GDI激进派，凯恩名下的Nod正统，还有隶属吉迪恩的Nod分裂主义[/b]，13和24为合作关系
倒是有个有意思的点，兄弟会每一代都不缺二五仔，算是传统艺能了。至于吉迪恩的叛变并一路阻碍凯恩的升天计划，官方似乎并没有解释，（在吃书漫画里面吉迪恩甚至都是凯恩一手安排的）
也不排除另一种可能，就是吉迪恩对凯恩的升天计划的改变感到不满
Nod最初信念是用泰伯利亚改造地球实现进化（通过命令与征服2可以了解最终可能将世界泰化，最后光头也升天便乘了光），但后来凯恩将自己升天的概念更换为""离开地球""。吉迪恩有可能是早期信念的拥护人，可能觉得我们辛辛苦苦打拼事业而光头却在想着跑路，才是真正的背叛者，把所有nod信徒摆了一道，自然有理由鼓动大量成员转而支持他的分裂主义并不遗余力的破坏升天计划

当然也有可能是EASB纯粹懒得编剧情直接吃书了

GDI方面詹姆斯的激进作为更偏向于公报私仇，因为她的两个孩子在第三次泰伯利亚战争中被思金人杀死，认为凯恩就是这一切的始作俑者（确实），同时凯恩与GDI的合作中仅仅与高层说明了自己的升天会彻底消除泰伯利亚，其余的官员都蒙在鼓里，詹姆斯认为凯恩开启传送门想把思金人引回地球引发新的战争，之前的事故早就给詹姆斯心底留下的恐惧阴影，这使她慢慢丧失理智，一切信念驱使她一心只想把凯恩从地球上彻底抹除

3.关于GDI第五关帮助主角越狱的人
这个也没有官方解释，神秘人杜凯特干员似乎在那一关之后就再也没出现过，那么他究竟是谁？目的是什么？
有一句不经意的话：有一个重要的人需要你离开
很明显了，他有极大可能是凯恩的信使，为什么？
除主角外的最后一位TCN植入者帕斯卡博士遭到杀害，但TCN的启动迫在眉睫，凯恩必须保证唯一可以操作TCN的主角的存活来完成自己的目的
同时在游戏开始时告诉主角""你需要支援，现在就要""然后就会有空降仓投下一只GDI步兵小队，而不是Nod的步兵，可见此人在GDI内部也拥有一定的权力（鸡呆：有内鬼，终止交易）
更多的资料似乎也不太好挖掘了，EASB也是真的绝，一个线性剧情的故事整的迷惑的不行还得东拼西凑自己推敲，当然也不排除是故意为了这样（cc4开发周期被大削，可能也是EALA为了减少工程量才这么做）
暂时先说这些 以后想起来再补的
总之cc4作为收尾作确实剧情缺少张力，上一代几乎是关系星球存亡的战斗到了这一代变成了小规模冲突，而且疯狂吃书，但毕竟官方最后一作也没办法不承认，但要说实在的，也算看的下去，虽然真的很让人失望
对了这一代剧情短的出奇，嗦不粗话
P.S. 虽然剧情涝但是其实还是被EA砍过，比如Nod线其实有自己的开头而不是继承GDI的分支等等
4.音乐：9/10
这一作的音乐非常棒，只能说配乐遇到一群猪队友带不动，不过不推荐各位玩之前去网易云等平台试听，一是平台收录几乎都不完整，二是cc4的音乐搭着游戏玩才有内味，只不过初次玩Nod你可能会有一种GLA的即视感，毕竟都是以女声吟唱为主+宗教感十足的风格，玩多了之后会感觉比鸡呆的还要有感觉

总之如果打总分的话，画面（10%）游戏性（50%）剧情（30%）音乐（10%）
（也不能说区别对待吧，隔壁RA3 本身就不是以剧情为主，所以剧情分占比较低，而cc正传这里剧情是灵魂呀，所以比重较高）
对于一路玩过来的cc粉丝来说，它就是这个最终得出来的5.9分了，但对于未接触过这个系列的人来说，其实真正的游戏体验比这个数字要高的多，玩起来感觉也还不错，不过也不能说粉丝挑剔，而是这个游戏配不上叫[b]4[/b]

Once completed, you can play normally. Arena of the Tortoise is essentially a buy-to-play MMO like R6S

(No need to download Origin)

Honestly, Arena of the Tortoise isn't as bad as you might think.

[b]1. Graphics: 7.5/10[/b] Many people are criticizing the graphics, saying it's worse than CC3 and uses the cartoon style of RA3. This is true; the RA series has always leaned towards ""political jokes"" and ""dark humor,"" so many people can accept the cartoon style. However, the main CC series, from the first game onwards, has always aimed for a more rigorous worldview, making this style look a bit awkward. Of course, I don't think the graphics are all bad. The models in this generation are more futuristic, and they look cool, that's all that matters. [strike]However, the units require a lot of grinding, which is annoying.[/strike] Secondly, at least CC4 doesn't have too much light pollution (the shield brightness is acceptable; if I had to say, the Firehawk airstrike is quite bright, but RA3's yellow faction color makes it feel like you're going to go blind). The unit details are also okay, but only to a passable degree (the Titan turning into cat ears after eating a blue core is quite cute). Personally, I think overall it's just passable, not as bad as some people say.

[b]2. Gameplay: 5.5/10[/b] To say it's boring is a bit of a stretch, but you'll always find yourself playing it for no reason. As for saying it's fun, I honestly can't find anything enjoyable about it. How do you play it? It's very simple.

You can choose to be either aggressive or passive, and select your turtle type: ground turtles (attack & defense) and flying turtles (support). Ground turtles are further divided into four-legged turtles and tracked turtles. Your ultimate goal is to capture turtle nests on the map to score points. Of course, you can also be more aggressive and take down the enemy's turtles.

Sometimes, players will throw carrots onto the field. You can send your units to collect the carrots and bring them back to your turtle beach, which will give you upgrade points to make your turtles stronger.

Seriously, let's talk about the major changes in this generation:

1. GDI and Nod can no longer be mixed. If you choose the GDI faction, your entire team must consist of GDI units.

2. No more sneaky farming; dual-technology is no longer possible.

3. All production buildings are now concentrated on the MCV (Multi-Channel Vehicle); they are no longer built separately.

4. Some units have been changed, such as the Bulldog changing from anti-armor to anti-light units, and the Venom changing from anti-infantry to anti-medium aircraft.

5. The familiar population cap has been removed, and there's no economy. The only resource gathering method is stealing Tienite to upgrade (the game's guidance is poor; you only gain points after transporting Tienite back to your own colored grid-like terrain base).

These are the main points; it's said that this will likely continue until next year in the game. I can't really judge whether it's fun or not. First, the game's damage output is surprisingly low (this could be improved in skirmishes), especially laser damage against infantry, which is incredibly weak. Countermeasures are very rigid, almost like a game of rock-paper-scissors. Of course, if you're just playing for fun, you can still use basic attacks. Artillery damage is decent against light and medium armor, and even heavy armor is somewhat manageable (though you might get a little bit of a setback). If you don't care about anti-air, just go for Hunters and Avengers. This rigidity is the first major drawback.

Second, EA advertised that this installment has the most toys, provided you're willing to grind. Skirmishes are inefficient, and you'll definitely be at a disadvantage in campaigns due to incomplete technology. Soloing a campaign will somewhat ruin the story experience. Of course, you can gain experience in online mode, but while there are players, finding a match is a nightmare.

However, don't worry too much. As long as you follow the story, your available armaments are enough to complete the game. You don't need to deliberately grind to max level. Even so, it's still annoying to not be able to use certain units.

Third, I don't know if this is a flaw, but I initially thought that the absence of resource gathering and construction would make this installment easier, but it turns out it's actually harder. Firstly, because of this rigid system of checks and balances, team composition and unit coordination become extremely important. Secondly, you need to capture multiple objectives; multitasking is essential.

This also represents the game's high barrier to entry. Those with RTS or RTT experience will be fine, but newbies will be almost guaranteed to give up.

It might seem okay at first, but it gets boring after completion.

Oh, and by the way, I originally intended to read the credits out of basic respect for the developers, but not only were the visuals repetitive, but the credits were also looping.

Before getting to the third point, a quick aside: since this is CNC (Completely Incompetent) content, how could we forget to criticize EASB?

The game's original title was... Command & Conquer: Arena, a spin-off MMO, was developed by EA due to their dissatisfaction with the EALA development team's inefficiency. EA demanded a mainline Command & Conquer game to cash in, but with insufficient time (reportedly less than a year), development was impossible. Therefore, Arena was repackaged as Tiberian Twilight.

Many signs of rushed development are visible in CC4, and I'll discuss the later plot briefly.

But the biggest mistake was releasing an RTT (real-time strategy) game when you knew only die-hard fans would play it as a concluding title.

P.S. The game's balance is poor, and the rigid controls mean that even if you go all out and bring along a few incompetent AI, it's difficult to turn the tide. The points you gain from conquering nodes with all your might might not even equal the points your AI teammates lose by sending several Mammoths to their deaths and wreckage in the enemy's base.

3. Story: 5/10

The following plot contains spoilers.

Finally, we've reached the most important part, one of the souls of the Critical Ops series, and also the biggest flaw of the Arena of Valor. Please don't criticize the following analysis if you disagree.

First, the biggest retcon is that Eggplant (the AI) is nowhere to be seen. He promised to take revenge on humanity, but we haven't even seen a shadow of him.

King: Earth's stinking little brothers, I'm here! Eat my Golden Fleet!

Eggplant AI: Connecting to server Earth. Confirm?

King: Confirmed, hurry up!

Eggplant AI: Unable to connect to EA server. Please check if your network cable is unplugged.

King: F*** you! Silk Scarf Technology is the best in the world! Who do you think you are?

Eggplant AI: Connection timed out, returning to base.

King: ??? ? ?

Besides this, there are still other unexplained bugs, such as the fact that yellow and blue zones no longer exist worldwide, and even GDI headquarters was inexplicably contaminated by Tiberium (Zocom: touched). The only remaining controllable contaminated zone is Paris (I wonder who dares to criticize France today.jpg). However, I've also come up with some personal thoughts, and I hope everyone can actively correct or supplement them.

1. Is GDI the biggest villain? Does CC4 whitewash Nod?

Personally, I don't think so. GDI's subjective goal was to completely purify the planet, while Nod's goal was to assist Kane in achieving ""ascension."" Looking at the final outcome, it's actually a win-win situation, except that [b]GDI's victory is built on Nod's victory[/b]. Whitewashing isn't really accurate. CC doesn't have the clear-cut good and evil concepts found in traditional Western action movies. GDI doesn't necessarily represent justice, and Nod doesn't necessarily represent evil, but honestly, I feel the Nod ending in the Turtle Arena is the more authentic ending.

2. What are the relationships between the various factions in the game? There are roughly four factions in the game: [b]the GDI Council led by Leos, the GDI Radicals under James, the Nod Orthodox faction under Kane, and the Nod Separatists affiliated with Gideon[/b]. Brotherhood 13 and 24 are cooperative.

An interesting point is that the Brotherhood has always had traitors in every generation; it's practically a tradition. As for Gideon's betrayal and his obstruction of Kane's ascension plan, the official explanation seems vague (in retconned comics, Gideon was even orchestrated by Kane).

Another possibility is that Gideon was dissatisfied with Kane's changes to the ascension plan.

The Nod's initial belief was to use Tiberium to terraform the Earth for evolution (as seen in Command & Conquer 2, which may ultimately lead to the Tiberiumization of the world, culminating in Kane's ascension), but later Kane changed his concept of ascension to ""leaving Earth."" Gideon might have been an early supporter of the beliefs, perhaps feeling that while they had worked hard to build the cause, Gideon was thinking of running away, making him the true traitor who had betrayed all Nod followers. He would naturally have had reason to incite a large number of members to support his separatism and relentlessly sabotage the Ascension Plan.

Of course, it's also possible that EASB simply didn't bother writing the plot and retconned the source material.

On the GDI side, James's radical actions leaned more towards personal revenge, as her two children were killed by the Scrins during the Third Tiberian War, and she believed Kane was the instigator (which is true). Meanwhile, in his cooperation with GDI, Kane only informed the higher-ups that his ascension would completely eliminate Tiberium; the rest of the officials were kept in the dark. James believed Kane opened the portal to lure the Scrin people back to Earth, triggering a new war. The previous incident had already left James with a deep-seated fear, slowly driving her to madness. Driven by unwavering conviction, she was solely focused on erasing Kane from Earth.

3. Regarding the person who helped the protagonist escape in GDI's fifth mission:

There's no official explanation for this. The mysterious operator, Dukat, seems to have disappeared after that mission. So who is he? What is his purpose?

There's a casual remark: ""An important person needs you to leave.""

It's quite obvious; he's highly likely Kane's messenger. Why?

Dr. Pascal, the last TCN implant recipient besides the protagonist, is murdered. However, TCN activation is urgent, and Kane must ensure the protagonist's survival—the only one capable of operating the TCN—to achieve his goals.

At the start of the game, the protagonist is told, ""You need support, now,"" followed by an airdrop of a GDI infantry squad, not Nod's, indicating this person wields some power within GDI (Chicken: There's a mole, terminate the deal). Further information seems difficult to uncover. EASB is truly cunning; they've made a linear story incredibly confusing, requiring piecing together clues and deduction. Of course, it's possible this was intentional (CC4's development cycle was significantly shortened, perhaps EALA did this to reduce workload).

That's all for now. I'll add more later if I think of anything else.

In short, CC4, as the final installment, definitely lacks plot tension. The battles of the previous game, almost a matter of planetary survival, became small-scale conflicts in this one, and it retconned a lot. But since it's the official final game, we can't deny it. To be honest, it's watchable, although very disappointing.

By the way, the story in this game is surprisingly short.

P.S. Although the plot is weak, it was actually cut by EA. For example, the Nod route actually had its own beginning instead of inheriting the GDI branch, etc.

4. Music: 9/10 The music in this game is excellent, but unfortunately, the soundtrack was ruined by a bunch of bad teammates. However, I don't recommend listening to it on platforms like NetEase Cloud Music before playing. First, the music on those platforms is almost incomplete, and second, the CC4 music only really feels right when played with the game. However, when you first play Nod, you might feel a bit like you're watching GLA, since both are mainly female chanting with a strong religious feel. After playing more, you'll find it even more impactful than GLA.

In short, if I were to give an overall score, it would be: Graphics (10%), Gameplay (50%), Story (30%), Music (10%)

(It's not fair to say they treated it differently, considering RA3 is another example.) (This game isn't primarily story-driven, so its story score is relatively low, whereas in the main Clash Royale series, the story is the soul, hence its higher weight.) For longtime Clash Royale fans, this final score of 5.9 is fitting. However, for those unfamiliar with the series, the actual gameplay experience is much higher than that number, and it's quite enjoyable. It's not that fans are being picky, but rather that this game doesn't deserve a 4.

Additionally: It seems Clash Royale 4 really likes hiding General's Easter eggs, such as the ""MiG Fighter"" achievement for the Light Bomber and the ""Crusader"" achievement for the Paladin."

Все остальное принадлежит чему угодно, но не тому, что мы привыкли называть Command & Conquer. Если это был эксперимент ЕА на тему ""давайте поставим игру с ног на голову"", то он удался, но я несколько в шоке. Причины шока:
- Экономики тут нет. Совсем. СКТ построили, тибериум оставили для улучшений юнитов. Нанимай столько, сколько размер армии позволит, а позволит он... в общем, стратегия чуть ли не всегда одна и та же получается в игре за исключением некоторых сюжетных поворотов в самих миссиях;
- Теперь вместо классической базы со зданиями нам выдали аж 3 типа мобильной базы под названием краулер, ориентированные на наступление, оборону и поддержку. Судя по всему, изначально хотели разделить бронетехнику, пехоту и авиацию, но в итоге только в обороне нету смешения первого и третьего, про баланс молчу;
- Вкатили систему званий через набор опыта, которая позволяет пользоваться новыми юнитами и улучшениями. Своеобразный ход, но вот зачем....;
- Улучшения юнитов зачем-то поделили на улучшения от разных видов тибериума, которые получаешь через трофеи с противников, и общие изучаемые через сбор кристаллов тибериума, заодно переломав в ту же сторону систему званий. В итоге получилось так себе;
- Сюжет крайне рваный, многое не обьясняется, все идет кусками, предлагая игроку самому поломать голову над происходящим;
- Отвратительная локализация. С каких пор GDI решили переводить как ГДИ, не знаю...;
- Графика.... Ну вот честно, мне третья часть куда больше понравилась в этом вопросе.

По итогам: пройти стоит ради того, чтобы увидеть завершение тибериумной эры и забыть.","I finally got to the final game in the C&C 4 series, spent 10 hours on the Brotherhood campaign, and realized that the only things that remained of the C&C atmosphere were the name, Kane, Tiberium, and some units from the second game. Everything else belongs anywhere but what we're used to calling Command & Conquer. If this was EA's experiment in ""let's turn the game on its head,"" it was a success, but I'm a bit shocked. The reasons for the shock:
- There's no economy here. None at all. They built the SCT, and left Tiberium for unit upgrades. Recruit as many as your army size allows, and it will... well, the strategy is almost always the same in the game, with the exception of a few plot twists in the missions themselves;
- Now, instead of a classic base with buildings, we're given three types of mobile bases called crawlers, focused on offense, defense, and support. Apparently, they initially wanted to separate armored vehicles, infantry, and aircraft, but in the end, only defense lacks a mix of the first and third, not to mention balance;
- They rolled out a rank system based on experience gain, which allows you to use new units and upgrades. It's a peculiar move, but why...;
- Unit upgrades were somehow divided into upgrades based on different types of Tiberium, which you get through enemy drops, and general upgrades that you can learn by collecting Tiberium crystals, simultaneously upending the rank system in the same direction. The end result was so-so;
- The plot is extremely disjointed, much is left unexplained, everything comes in bits and pieces, leaving the player to puzzle out what's happening;
- Terrible localization. Since when did they decide to translate GDI as GDI, I don't know...;
- Graphics.... Honestly, I liked the third game much more in this regard.

Maybe I messed something up and had to start over—I had to re-enter my account and password! That means I have to enter my account and password every time I enter the game! The serial number just wouldn't work; after searching online, I found out I had to redeem it online.

That's not all. Playing single-player mode requires a constant internet connection.

So I have to re-enter my account and password, confirm my game name, and enter the game again. It's like playing single-player mode and getting a rollback...

The most fatal flaw is the game content. It's no longer about real-time strategy—collecting resources, developing troops, and building units. Instead, you're given a command center and you just press the button to order the troops. Technology development is just research in the command center. There's no concept of money; besides the command center, you only have 50 units. And each unit doesn't even have a population of 1. You can't build many troops at once. Tactics? Since troops are free, I'll just build more; there's no concept of casualties. Trading 50 tanks for one enemy soldier isn't a loss, right? What kind of game is this? The controls are terrible too. Aside from the special effects, the atmosphere and gameplay are worse than 2. Is this a refund? The money didn't even go to WW (World War II)."

PD: Iniciar el juego puede traer serios problemas debido a que el launcher funciona mal a la hora de crear cuenta.","Unfortunately, I have to give this game a bad rating despite it being a C&C game.

The plot is great and I loved it, but the gameplay mechanics are uglier than Diego Maradona in his underwear. Very few units, no economic system, the combat is as tough as Diego Maradona visiting the Casa Rosada (the presidential palace), but above all, the online system is completely neglected...

A shame for a series that brought us more joy than Diego Maradona.

PS: Starting the game can cause serious problems because the launcher malfunctions when creating an account."

帐号我是橘子注册，所以没问题，大不了去橘子上注册，我不相信现在大家连橘子碰都不碰，我是小时候玩的盗版，正版入的不久，频繁的断开连接没遇到，这个就不反喷了。

战斗模式我认为很棒，不是一般的棒，抛弃资源，水晶变成升级点数，让玩家可以全身心的打战术，不再为经营烦恼，因为这就是战术为重点的RTS，帝国时代3已经是运营RTS巅峰，再去做没意思，人优我转。

剩下什么人口少，兵种设计没意义之类的内容喷，我只说一点，需要打垃圾剧情来解锁兵种确实恶心，剧情垃圾我也很烦，但是其它问题已经有大神说了，你们所喷的问题都是不适应造成的，我一直在跟电脑打遭遇磨练技术，所以兵种平衡性我无法评论。

还是老生常谈的内容，玩不惯，玩不爽不是游戏垃圾，是你的问题，之前的命令系列和红警系列在兵种上没有平衡，纯属是爆兵娱乐向RTS，所以突然竞技化肯定不适应，星际2时极限运动，跟你的apm和运营有很大关系，战术啥的根据版本变，到现在都没有做到平衡也是服了。",

自己一个人玩的时候，满屏幕都写着两个字，无聊。
而且那个升级系统，EA是认真的么，无聊真的。
更让人郁闷的是，这一部游戏的过场剧情做得特别差。
前作打下了极好的基础，埋下的诸多伏笔，俨然已经将故事推向了最高潮。
结果到这一部，啪唧，剧情摔了，最后做出个烂尾结局，草草了事。

Сквозь года, моё восприятие изменилось, и сейчас запуская эту игру, я стал понимать, от чего так геймеры обозлились на ЕА, разработчики всё похерили и угробили серию C&C со своим многопользовательским режимом. Да, в неё играть можно, но не в одиночку, а только с друзьями (как Red Alert 3).
Помня ещё первое впечатление от игры, когда удалось урвать пиратский диск без багов и с русской озвучкой за 150-200 руб (лицензионка стоила от 450-700 отдельно или сборником и в разных магазинах по разному $$$) я ставлю палец вверх, так как эта последняя игра из серии C&C, в которую ещё можно рубиться в одну харю.
 Спойлер к игре: Как оказалось Кейн был Скрином, который 1000 лет ждал прибытия, и благодаря захваченной вышке в третьей части игры, он смог ""вознестись"" (отправиться домой), прихватив с собой всех последователей, своих новых братьев, а что касается командира, киборга, он исполнил свой долг, активировал врата-вышку чужих и благополучно скончался, на этой ноте и завершаются события серии игр C&C, всё, эпилог.
P/s: Хотя бы ради любопытства стоит купить эту игру, чтобы насладиться конечным видеороликом, всё понять и осознать, как же долго бедолага Кейн ждал возвращения домой...",

Game: 
Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight
...
About & Plot: 
This is the end to the Tiberium canon universe, Kane and Tiberium leave together, but before that happens you must help either GDI or NOD to get the outcome, the outcome is the same no matter who you side with, really, and there's no bonus nor hidden ending from what I can tell nor find either,
...
Story & Spoilers:
Tiberium has evolved and is spreading at such a rate that the whole planet is expected to become uninhabitable by 2068. Humanity is on the brink of extinction. The player takes the role of Commander Parker, a GDI military officer who receives an optical implant after his battle wounds have caused him to lose his eyesight. The player is presented with the possibility to aid either Colonel Louise James's GDI extremists or Kane's Nod Loyalist forces in the Fourth Tiberium War. After the final battle for the Threshold 19, Kane is about to leave Earth using the Scrin tower. He convinces Commander Parker (the player) to activate it for him with the optical implant. The player is shot by Colonel James but nonetheless succeeds in activating the portal. In both campaigns, Kane enters the portal. In the ending cut-scene, news channels announce that the Tiberium growth has receded following the complete activation of Tiberium Control Network and all the Nod followers have entered the Scrin tower and disappeared. Kane and Nod are no more and Tiberium follows suit slowly, thus closing the book to the Saga.

Strategy, Gameplay, Mechanics and Statistics:
The time to take you to beat both campaigns is mmm 3-18 hours depends on how you go about doing it, and highest level is level 20 (GDI) level 20 (NOD) so Max is level 40 witch can take you 3-8+ hours grinding, the best way to grind in skirmishes is medium vs brutal with you on the brutal side and trying to speedrun to 4000 points in the best shortest replay moves, if you play average or are a casual person it can take you 3-5 hours to Max both sides, if you are a pro or an expert at game mechanics or very enthusiastic in ""speedrunning to Lv40"" it can take 1-4 hours and playing the story at max can take 2-5 hours to beat both campaigns so if you tried or wanted you could be New to completing the whole game in under 6-12 hours.

The Good and Pro:
-RPG RTS
-5v5 w/A.I
-Short Story
-End to a Saga

The Bad and Cons:
-Original intentions for online only

-Required one time use access key for the pc
-Requires to be signed in in order to play
-No extra content or hidden content for 100% in the game
-No reward for beating or completing the game

-A poorly shoehorn motivation involving your wife
-Cutscenes and Gameplay in campaign refers your wife to get you motivated and have purpose but you're only introduced to her for existing and being like ""this is your wife"" and then dying immediately soon after and is an annoying reminder that's shes a shoe horn into the plot to motivate the player making the story seemed rushed when shes brought up especially how they do it in GDI campaign

...
CONCLUSION:
I recommend this game, finish and end a book that's just the Tiberium series, the Final Chapter to the Canon Tiberium universe, to have a short game you can complete it in 1-3 days or in 6-12 hours, just ignore the existence of your wife when she is brought up for motivational plot convenience and you have a very nice endgame pages to look at, its got great music, there is no extra stuff for 100% it so you can get it to cross off your list so you don't have to come back to it ever if you don't want to.","10/10

About & Plot: 
This is the end to the Tiberium canon universe, Kane and Tiberium leave together, but before that happens you must help either GDI or NOD to get the outcome, the outcome is the same no matter who you side with, really, and there's no bonus nor hidden ending from what I can tell nor find either,

ข้อดี
1. ถ้าเล่นโดยที่ไม่สนเนื้อเรื่องและภาคเก่าๆ มันยังพอหาความสนุกได้อยู่บ้าง อย่างน้อยมันยังมีแนววางแผนหลงเหลืออยู่บ้าง(มั้งนะ)
ข้อเสีย
1. เล่นออฟไลน์ไม่ได้ บังคับออนไลน์ตลอด ยิ่งถ้าเน็ตไม่ดี มีหลุดกลางเกมอีก
2. เนื้อเรื่องน่าเบื่อ แย่ที่สุด ทำลายตำนานของซีรี่ย์ C&C จนพินาศย่อยยับ ทำเอาตัวร้ายอย่าง Kane ไร้เสน่ห์ไปเลย
3. ระบบออนไลน์แย่ หาห้องยากมาก แทบไม่คนเลย เซิฟห่วยแตก
4. ใช้ยูนิตทุกตัวไม่ได้ ต้องมานั่งลงแมพ ลงเนื้อเรื่อง เก็บแต้มมาปลดล็อคยูนิตแต่ละตัว อันนี้ทุเรศที่สุด เพราะมันควรจะให้ใช้ทุกตัวได้มาตั้งแต่แรก ไม่ใช่มาล็อคแบบนี้
สรุป เละเทะ ทุเรศทุรังที่สุด เข้าใจว่าอยากทำแนวใหม่ แต่ควรไปทำเป็นเกมใหม่เลย ไม่ใช่เอามาทดลองใช้กับเกมซีรี่ย์เก่าเป็นหนูทดลองแบบนี้

С этого момента у некогда культовой серии началась “новая жизнь”. Последующие несколько лет студийные беженцы, примкнувшие к EA Los Angeles, сочли необходимым замешивать рассыпчатый шарм сериала с бульоном на костях – сначала ответвление Generals, потом, наконец, [b]Command & Conquer 3[/b]. Не сказать, что последняя получилась из рук вон плохо, определенно не сказать. Тем не менее, воочию, кроме основы и свежей обертки нужно было добавить чуть больше смелых идей, больше тактики и больше вычурности игрового баланса – обязательно, с пониманием дела. Сейчас же это в прошлом – господа, пробуксовка на месте сменилась левым креном.[/i]

[h1]Тиберий во мгле[/h1]

Electronic Arts преподносила [b]C&C 4[/b] как эпичное завершение саги, длившейся целых 15 лет, и обещала ответить на все вопросы о Кейне и тиберии. Увы, достойного финала не вышло. Одиночная кампания разочарует и тех, кто следил за борьбой GDI и Братства Нод долгие годы, и новичков, которым сценаристы решили вообще ничего не объяснять.

В [b]C&C 3[/b] и [b]Kane’s Wrath[/b] авторы грубо оборвали повествование — Кейн активировал башню инопланетян, и экран утонул в белизне. «Мостик» к [b]C&C 4[/b] до ужаса банален, пусть и логичен. Лидер Нод заполучил технологии фиолетовых жуков-пришельцев, и от «вознесения» его отделяет один шаг. Однако собственных ресурсов Братства не хватило, чтобы провести ритуал и открыть портал. Кейн был вынужден предложить GDI перемирие. Объединив усилия, заклятые враги построили Сеть контроля тиберия. Любителям свободы и демократии она поможет избавить планету от зеленой заразы, а фанатикам — достичь их мистической цели.

Разумеется, не всем в GDI и Нод понравился этот союз. Вскоре вспыхнули масштабные мятежи, затягивающие игрока в водоворот странной гражданской войны. Свои интересы в конфликте преследуют сразу четыре фракции. Видимо, разработчики писали историю под впечатлением от четвертого сезона ""Крейсер ""Галактика"""". О сериале напоминают и некоторые композиции саундтрека, окончательно порвавшего с творчеством Фрэнка Клепаки .

Столь подробное описание сюжета — суровая необходимость. Он подан так скомкано и сумбурно, что информацию приходится по крупицам выуживать из роликов, заданий на миссию, текстов в руководстве пользователя и комиксов на официальном сайте.

К слову, восторга от просмотра видео в [b]C&C 4[/b] нет: декорации бедны как церковная мышь, «пререндер» уступает стареньким [b]Red Alert[/b] и [b]Tiberian Sun[/b], noname-актеры сильно переигрывают. Особенно усердствуют дамы — вечно хнычущая жена главного героя  и его начальница полковник Джеймс. Правда, динамичных моментов больше, чем в [b]C&C 3[/b], и Джо Кукан по-прежнему хорош, но даже злодейская харизма не спасает. Противостояние, решающее судьбу Земли, слишком похоже на возню в песочнице.

Едва локомотив сценария набирает ход, EA LA бьет по тормозам. GDI досталось девять операций, причем в первых трех втолковывают, как двигать камеру и щелкать по кнопкам. Втиснуть интригу в такие узкие рамки было просто невозможно. У Нод ситуация чуть приличнее. Командующий-перебежчик попадает в их ряды после «учебки» GDI, а затем служит новым хозяевам в семи сражениях. 

[h1]Тиберий не тонет[/h1]

Браться за [b]C&C 4[/b] стоит лишь в режиме совместного прохождения, где почему-то недоступны «сейвы». В [b]Red Alert 3[/b] от той же студии именно перепалки с напарником скрашивали самые унылые эпизоды. Да и над уродством графики, порожденной доисторическим движком SAGE, можно посмеяться вдвоем. Впрочем, достоинствам «коопа» не скрыть убожество игрового процесса. EA LA, всегда с опаской глядевшая на эксперименты коллег, в этот раз пошла на радикальные реформы. Вроде бы хотели они как лучше…

Вместо того чтобы пошаманить над геймплейной формулой, авторы… отсекли все «ненужное». Из четвертой части исчезли многие черты, бывшие визитной карточкой C&C, включая харвестеры, строительство базы и снабжение электроэнергией. Тиберий, к середине XXI века отравивший всю планету, в игре почти не встречается. Если бы не истеричные бунтари, Сеть со дня на день завершила бы очистку и принесла мир и спокойствие. А пока редкие кристаллы, разбросанные по закоулкам, идут на улучшения. Зеленые минералы дают право купить один «апгрейд», синие — два, красные — пять.

Все, что остается — возить по полю брани «мобильный штаб» и заказывать в нем подкрепления. Выполнив подряд, «матка» садится на грунт, и выползающие из ее чрева юниты тут же вступают в бой. Финансовых затрат производство не требует, хотя штамповать армию до бесконечности нельзя — лимит позволяет набрать десяток-другой бронемашин.

Какую бы задачу ни поставило начальство, мы действуем по шаблону: затариваемся под завязку и прем к цели, преодолевая сопротивление. Методично «зачищать» карту или проворачивать хитрые маневры незачем. Вражеский конвейер работает не хуже нашего, поэтому противника можно взять только нахрапом. Разгром чужой базы или потеря своей тоже ни на что не повлияют — через несколько секунд покровители пришлют замену.

«Битвы», когда два MCV выезжают на поляну и раскладываются в десятке метров друг от друга, выглядят нелепо. Тактика сведена к подбору правильных аргументов: лазерами вскрыть тяжелую броню, натравить ПВО на самолеты и т. п. Захват нейтральных объектов (автоматических пушек, сенсоров, замечающих «невидимок») не добавляет интереса.

Чтобы оживить вялые схватки «стенка на стенку», EA LA разделила войска по трем специализациям. К первому виду штаба относятся танки, артиллерия и коммандос, ко второму — пехота и оборонительные сооружения, к третьему — авиация и ряд умений, ослабляющих неприятеля и усиливающих союзников. Выбранное направление потом можно сменить на более подходящее.

Правда, оценить все 90 юнитов и зданий нелегко. Изначально игроку подсовывают скромный комплект из 3-4 типов. Другие придется открывать, «прокачивая» свою учетную запись. Драгоценную «экспу» начисляют за основные и промежуточные задания, убийство врагов, заработанные «достижения» и победы в сетевых баталиях. Эта неплохая, в сущности, идея также пострадала от бездарной реализации. По сути, тем, кто не одолел «сингл», запретили встревать в онлайновые разборки. Никакая сноровка не спасет, если вы бросите на пулеметы солдат в бумажных доспехах.

Кроме «Мамонтов» и прочих «толстячков», смотреть на высоких уровнях особенно не на что — искусственно раздутый ассортимент не впечатляет. В [b]Tiberian Sun[/b] и [b]Tiberium Wars[/b] об игре у GDI и Нод были уникальные подразделения, а в [b]C&C 4[/b] их различия минимальны. Разве что «лучи смерти» разных цветов.

Грустно наблюдать за тем, как разработчики решили поставить точку в истории. Верю, что они пытались как лучше, как проще, как интереснее, но получилось абсолютно невыносимо – глубочайший удар под дых фанатам и всей серии в целом. Проект со скучный процессом, отвратительный мультиплеером, кособокой системой достижений и совершенно безобразным графическим стилем. Огрызок стратегии, лишенный не только несущей платформы, но и надежды на будущее.[/i]",

Lamentablemente, al comprarlo en pack con otros títulos de la saga, el equipo de soporte de Steam consideró el tiempo de juego de los otros (Red Alert 3 + Expansión) para negarse a la devolución (siendo que claramente este en particular no tenía tiempo de juego, por que no podía ingresar). Finalmente, después de investigar por mi cuenta pude finalizar la instalación, pero ojala que nunca hubiese funcionado. Nada más lejos de la jugabilidad que la saga me tenía acostumbrado... No existe la construcción de estructuras, no hay que recolectar recursos, tiene un nivel de población limitado y pequeño, la historia principal se fue por una tangente que tiene nada que ver con lo que se esperaba de acuerdo a la línea de su predecesor, sólo una base que genera todo, limitando la expansión estratégica ya que sólo puedes tener esa base y la desastrosa costumbre que están tomando las compañías de tener que estar siempre ""online"", que es un despropósito para partidas Single Player. Las cinemáticas siguen siendo buenas, tiene un sistema de upgrades que podría haber funcionado bien si el resto de la jugabilidad se hubiese mantenido, pero sumando y restando diría que es el peor título de la saga, como si tuviera foco para consola o ser jugado con un mando, perdiendo toda su esencia. No recomendado para fanáticos, tal vez para alguien que nunca haya jugado los títulos anteriores podría funcionar... E igual tengo mis dudas al respecto.",

Наверное стоит рассказать, как я про нее вообще узнал. Точно не скажу, но было как то в журнале ""Игромания"" упоминание о разработке данной игры, рассказывали о том, что будет Самой красивой RTS. О новой фишке- Краулерах (Самоходный сборочный цех, который не строил здания, а производил войска прямо внутри себя, и что самое главное, мог оказывать поддержку и постоять за себя). Звучало для юного меня очень заманчиво. Но что насторожило, это отсутствие  кристала Тибериума (или Тиберия, как вам удобнее). Ни на одном скрине ничего не было. Зато писали про ""СКТ"". Что это, не ясно. и дата релиза был в 2010.
Но у нас  в Москве я лично ее нигде не видел, и с где то пару месяцев поисков вздохнул и играл дальше в Tiberian Sun. Но толи в 2012ом году, толи в 2013 ом, когда был ивент в Стиме с угольками под новый год , друг один решил мне сделать приятное, и подогнал ее. Я был в диком восторге, ведь это она, та самая игра, о котором я читал несколько лет назад в журнале! Подарив ему в ответ ..  я не помню что.., я поспешил устанавливать..
Что первое встречало рядового игрока, это окошко логина. Косо смотря на нее, я зарегистрировался впервые у электронщиков, выбрал себе ник и не задумываясь ни о мультиплеере, ни о настройках. Я сразу хотел приступить к кампании за моих любимчиков , братства НОД.
Но тебя заставляли играть в занудную обучалку за GDI. С другой стороны было приятно смотреть на все те же видеовставки, с живыми актерами. Правда сюжет... ммм... Даже не знаю, сейчас про него говорить, или позже.. Хотя нет, не могу.
Вначале вам покажут, что на нашей планете спустя несколько лет, после третьей тиберевой , наступил полный п*здец- уровень заражения тиберием достиг крит. отметки, жить невозможно. Совет GDI уже не знают что делать (ХОТЯ НЕТ, Я СДЕРЖИВАТЬСЯ ТУТ НЕ НАМЕРЕН! ЧТО БЛ*ТЬ МЕШАЕТ ПРОСТО ПОНАСТРОИТЬ ХАРВЕСТЕРОВ И ПРОСТО СОБИРАТЬ И ПЕРЕРАБАТЫВАТЬ ЕГО? НАЧИНАЯ С ПЕРВОЙ ЧАСТИ ЭТОТ ВОПРОС МЕНЯ НЕ УНИМАЛСЯ, ОНИ ТАМ ЧТО, ТРИЖДЫ КЕЙНА КОГДА УБИВАЛИ РАЗЛИЧНЫМИ СПОСОБАМИ ПРОСТО В ГАРАЖАХ ОТСТАВЛЯЛИ И СМОТРЕЛИ КАК ПЛАНЕТА РАЗРАСТАЛАСЬ ЗЕЛЕНЫМ ДЕРЬМОМ??), но к ним ВНЕЗАПНО на транспортном корабле выходит сам Кейн, ибо он жив, цел, орел, и говорит ""Джентельмены , у меня есть план!"" и показывает Тацит (За который во втором тиберьевом мы чуть ли не глотки драли , дабы забрать у них же и у обезумевшего КАБАЛа, ну да х*й с ним).Проходит время, и сотрудничая с Пророком, инженеры смогли построить СКТ , что переводится как Сеть Контроля Тиберия. Эта конструкия позволяла не давать кристаллам разрастаться как крапива на вашем заднем дворе и в тоже время собирать с них полезные ресурсы. И вроде вот, наступило светлое будущее, уровень заражения сильно упал, пошла растительность, людской народ спасен. Но Сепаратистам Гидеона, что откололись от братства, считали это ересью, и что кейн просто поехал с катушек, ибо это противоречело планам изначального (С этой стороны он прав, ведь на протяжении трех игр, мы занимались тем, чтобы засрать всю планету тиберием, дабы человечество познала истину.. ну или что то типа того. Правда в третьей игре все это было нужно , чтобы вызвать пришельцев, чтобы они понаставили своих врат, но я что то улетел от темы). Мы, как новый командующий армией GDI, должны были сопроводить караван, в котором находился сам пророк. После уничтожения  засад, он нам говорил что мы еще встретимся. И Внезапно после отбития узла СКТ, происходит взрыв, который нас грубо говоря вырубает. Нас поднимает наша Жена с стоящим сзади охранником, и беспокоится за нас, и хочет чтобы мы были с ней. и тут нам дают выбор, или мы идем за пророком, или за генералом Дейвиз (О котором нигде толком ничего не было, но если вкратце, то она поехавшая на всю катушку баба. Она потеряла при вторжении Скриннов свою семью. И во всем винит как раз Пророка). Я больше считаю каноничным сюжет за НОД. Почему? Там больше раскрывается сюжет , ибо если выбрать генерала, то Дейвиз на протяжении ВСЕХ миссии будет гонятся за ним, насрав на приказы командования, насрав на своих подчиненных. Она. Хочет. Убить. Кейна! И в конце это у нее получается! Вот только не совсем..
Выбрав сторону Нод, нужно отбить город от Сепаратистов Гидеона, которые устроили бунт, сжигая город дотла. Вот незадача, а GDI  нас не приветствует тут, да и наша жена тут. Вроде мы ее спасли, а вроде.. вдруг откуда ни возьмись и ракетой по транспорту зацепили. Тела нет. Вроде навевают грусть, но тебе как то пох*й. затем мы отбивает у одновременно у GDI и Гидеона несколько СКТ, и в один момент, когда мы приближались к нужной целе, Кейну не понравилось, что за нами по пятам шла Джейвиз. Он приказал убить. Мы как то сомневаемся, и внезапно он показывает что у нее наша жена. Жива и здорова. Как? Меня спрашиваешь?? ОТКУДА МНЕ ЗНАТЬ! ТАМ ТАКАЯ БАНДУРИНА ВЛЕТЕЛА, ЧТО МОКРОГО МЕСТА БЫ НЕ ОСТАВИЛО, но если мы хотим ее увидеть живой, то мы должны уничтожить  бывшего начальника. Говоришь х*йня вопрос, бать. и с горем пополам уничтожаешь Ох*еть огроменный корабль. Он реально огромный. 
После убийства, вновь посылают за СКТ, но вот незадача : Гидеон мразь, и прознал про то, что для работы с Скт нужны имплантанты, вживленные в 5 человек. 4ых он уже кокнул. ""Остался последний"" С ехидной улыбкой говорит нам в камеру. Кейн Ох как забеспокоился что его план летит к чертям, и устроил подмену лица.. и тела. ""Без лица, фильм второй""!
Затем мы от лица Кейна сначала взломали  Краулер, в котором находились координаты убежища Гидеона, в следующем мы должны были его захватить.. Я ненавижу эту миссию. контроль точек , которые нельзя было отдавать врагу, или он сдохнет, что Не нравилось Кейну, ибо тогда он будет мучеником, а это выставит Пророка в худшем свете. Захватив его и выступив перед публикой за него, мы получили пулю в грудь. Угоняем Краулер у GDI , пытаемся смотаться из этого дерьма, ибо тут начинается кровавое веселье меж GDI  и NOD , ведь братья нас не признают своим , ведь мы в чужом краулере.
А под конец эпичное противостояние меж нами, братьями и GDI, ведь нам нужно запустить  башню Скриннов. До Них наконец дошло что мы творим какую то ахинею, и пытаются нас остановить, но тщетно. ВНЕЗАПНО прилетает Дейвис, которая все же выжила, и орет в духе ""ТЫ НЕ ПРОЙДЕШЬ!"" и с пафосным роликом , где она одной бомбой уничтожает краулер. Без особого труда (ибо это вам не захват контрольных точек!) мы ее уничтожаем.
в финале показывают ролик, как мы вместе с Кейном открываем портал, но эта тварь все еще жива. какого х*я? ДА ПОНЯТИЯ НЕ ИМЕЮ, ЧТО ДО*БАЛСЯ? Дейвис стреляет в нас, считая что мы Кейн. Но он хватает ее и начинается махач. Мы кое как открываем портал.. и умираем. После этого рассказывают что Пророк вместе с тысячими последователи шагнули во врата и их никто больше не видел. Вроде наконец и хеппиэнд, а вроде...как то хз.
Как видно, игра сюжетом не блещет и создает много противоречий.
Картинка на то время и правда была прекрасной, меня впечатляла, особенно детализация самих пехотинцев. Красивые выстрелы тяжелых пехотинцев, взрывы смачные.
Музыка лично мне ох как нравится, особенно тема у НОД. Но почему такие отрицательные рецензии и оценки?
Первая причина- Это не C&C. Это МОБА. Внезапно. Из за отстуствия кристаллов как ресурс, мы не тратим ресурсы на создание воиск. Они вылезают с краулера, который считается как ""Герой"". Сами боевые действия выглядят так. Видишь врага? Становишься перед ним, по кд нажимаешь на производство, и стараешься задавить врага. Забавно выглядит бой меж двумя краулерами, которые впритык к друг к другу стоят.
Вторая причина- Гринд. в RTS. Да , ты меня правильно понял. Чтобы получить доступ к шикарным юнитам, тебе нужно качать свое звание. За одну миссию можно получить два уровня. А тебе нужно получить 20 званий, дабы стать самым крутым командиром на районе. Итого тебе нужно потратить грубо говоря 8 часов нудного гринда на одной, мать его миссии (Город в огне, или как то так)

- network oriented gamplay: teamwork/cooperative, deathmatch (there's still a small singleplayer campaign)

- quality over quantity: you can't build hundreds of units (there are points as a limit system, their maximum depends on player's profile level) so you really have to be more tactical, keep them alive so they become veterans, use their special abilities

Познакомился с этой серией я в далеком 2000, с Command & Conquer: Tiberium sun, это было что-то с чем-то, шедевр, легенда, прошедшая проверку временем. Затем появился не плохой, но без яиц Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium wars. 
А потом пришло оно, в 2010, назвать это игр.. иг.. игро…й, этот  кусок гов#а, язык не поворачивается. Поиграл, охр#нел, и удалил. Спустя почти 5 лет, я решил все же пройти историю Command & Conquer до конца. Интересно, что стало с Кейном, GDI,NOD, тибериумом в целом. Как раз в steam’е продавалась вся серия C&C со скидкой. Купил, повторно прошел C&C  Tiberium wars, C&C Red alert 3, и забил. Прошло еще около 4 лет, и я вновь собрался с силами. 
И тут началось, регистрация на сайте ЕА, регистрация в магазине ЕА, регистрация регистрации. Пройдя всю бюрократию, в ведя имя профиля, введя пароль, ведя что-то там еще, игра под конец просит ввести код активации. КАКОЙ НА Х#Й КОД? Подсказка объясняет, что код, на обратной стороне коробки. КАКЯ БЛ#ДЬ КОРОБКА? или, вам должен был придти код на почту. КАКАЯ НА ХРЕН ПОЧТА, ДЕСЯТИ ЛЕТНЕЙ ДАВНОСТИ? ИДИ#ТЫ. Код активации от steam, не подходит, можете забрать его себе, вот F8JJ-KRFH-UUHH-4CW9-GZHQ. Оказалось что ЕА обрубила все свои конченые сервера.    
И тут в глазах потемнело, вся ненависть к ЕА копившаяся на протяжении 20 лет вырвалась наружу. 
Держитесь…
Я всем сердцем ненавижу эту компанию этих, жадных, бездушных МУД#КОВ. Они скупают, велики студии, а затем паразитируют на их достижениях, при этом, как настоящие паразиты, они убивают своих носителей. Так поступили с Westwood studios. Мы все знаем, как обошлись с их наследием, и уж точно не забудем, как бы не старались ПИД#РАСЫ из ЕА, скрыть свое преступление, закрывая сервера twilight (ставить приставку C&C рядом с этой херо#добиной просто оскорбительно) 
Как они обошлись с Dead Space, хотя это и отчасти их продукт, но боже, как же, они дро#или собственных разработчиков, ставили им палки в колеса. И что в итоге, первая часть: всемирное признание, десятки наград, любовь фанатов. Но МУД#КАМ из ЕА нужно больше золота. В итоге …. Третья часть, и все сотрудники идут нах#й… Позор и Забытье.
А теперь эти ПИД#РМОТЫ добрались до ВЕЛИКОЙ BioWare. Кто в танке, это создатели первого Mass effect, Dragon Age: Origins, а для олдскулов, это создатели ВЕЛИКОГО Baldur's Gate. И что же мы имеем, а имеем мы мертвую BioWare, а из ее гниющего трупа, как чужой из груди, вылезает Mass effect: andromeda. А в это время ЕА имеет нас, и наш кошелек.  И таких примеров десятки. Вы понимаете размеры злодеяния этой ЗЛОЕБ#ЧЕЙ компании и нанесенного ею морального вреда фанатам.
Но если этих ХУ#СОС#В из ЕА еще можно как-то оправдать: алчность – надо купить крутую компанию, жадность – надо быстро выпустить го#ноигру, эгоизм – пофиг на людей, главное бабки.. бабки.. бабки… То, как можно оправдать игроков-ПИЗ#ЮКОВ, которые тащат свои кровные, или кровные своих родитель, что бы поддерживать существование этого БЛ#ДЬ паразита в игросфере. Которые, за чтобы не взялись, всё уничтожают, а если не уничтожат, то извратят, до неузнаваемости. Но ДОЛБОКЛОУНЫ готовы, не только покупать их ДЕРЬ#ОИГРЫ, но и сливать кучу денег, что бы, купить себе красивую зимнюю шапку с рогами как у оленя, для своего персонажа, может потому что вы и есть олени. 
В итоге, наследие игр, которые мы любили в детстве, уничтожено либо осквернено.  Компании их создавшие, поглощены и разорены. Люди причастные к созданию великих шедевров, вложившие свою душу и сердце, сейчас чуть ли не подвергнуты гонению. ЕА, это как 3-й рейх в игроиндустрии, который либо всех поглотит либо уничтожит, и вместо того что бы с ним бороться, вы поддерживаете его существование, засылая свои кровные.Остановитесь.

一个rts游戏变成了类似打怪升级的游戏。新手进去由于级别太低，单位都解锁不了，只能一堆一级兵打人家满级兵。。。。这还打个屁。我战役连第一关都过的非常吃力，低等级50人口的一级普通兵，打人家茫茫多的满级高级兵，任务是保护平民逃难车，对手nod两个兵营处茫茫多的高级兵种，而我只有初级兵种。我想游戏设计之处肯定是瞅准了花钱升级这个点，否则级别高的玩家纯粹就是虐杀低等级玩家。

可怜正版玩家了。电脑无限爆各种高级兵种，而你只有可怜的5种低级兵，人口锁定50，面对电脑若干兵营爆出大量的兵。完全没法打，打就是添油战，，只能是换同等数量对面兵，不打就是被对手不断爆兵到一定数量一波消灭。一局游戏，打了1个小时，还是原地踏步，完全的焦灼，没有任何出路。什么rts，任何战略都用不到，就是机械的防守就完了。

Unfortunately, anything but Command & Conquer! Even the stupid registration via an account is annoying! If only it would work. I saw about 2% of the game, then I had to reinstall my PC due to a system crash and since then I have not been able to log in because my account is already taken! It doesn't matter at all that I have the right passwords and user names, the system doesn't accept access.
When I asked support, as is always to be expected with Electronic Arts, there was no answer at first and after a long time of pestering me, I was simply told that it was probably a local problem and that I should just buy the game again!
So typical ElectronicArts. The main thing is to take money out of your pocket and not have to deliver anything in return. Cheeky!
This filthy publisher and game studio destroyer should be closed down by the state and the UN, the management staff expropriated and sentenced to a lifetime of forced gaming of the pearls of the gaming world that they themselves defaced.
What I was able to see during the only access I've had so far was anything but convincing. This crawler principle seems to be anything but convincing, but as I said, since I can't access it, further analysis is unfortunately out of the question. ElectronicArts can go to hell!


German:
Leider alles andere als Command & Conquer! Schon die dämliche Anmeldung über ein Konto nervt! Wenn sie denn wenigstens mal funktionieren würde. Ich hab etwa 2% von dem Spiel gesehen, danach mußte ich aufgrund eines Systemcrash meinen PC neu aufsetzen und seitdem kann ich mich nicht mehr einloggen, da mein Konto ja schon vergeben sei! Es spielt überhaupt keine Rolle, daß ich die richtgen Passwörter und Benutzernahmen habe, das System akzeptiert den Zugriff nicht.
Auf Nachfrage beim Support kommt wie bei Electronic Arts stets zu erwarten erst mal keine Antwort und nach langem nerven dann nur lapidar, daß sei wohl ein lokales Problem und ich solle mir das Spiel eben noch mal kaufen!
Also ganz typisch ElectronicArts. Hauptsache Geld aus der Tasche gezogen und dafür nix liefern müssen. Frechheit!
Dieser Dreckspublisher und Spielestudiozerstörer gehört von Staats- und UNO-wegen geschlossen, das Direktionspersonal enteigent und zu lebenslangen Zwangsspielen der von ihnen selbst verunstalteten Perlen der Spielewelt verurteilt.
Das was ich beim bisher einzigesten Zugriff sehen konnte ist übrigens auch alles andere als überzeugend gewesen.

- too shallow for an MMO game
- too shallow for a C&C game

TL,DR: just leave it alone. Really, don't bother

This game is marred by bad design from the start.
 
It forces you to play online, YET it won't start, unless you log onto Origin, and add your CD key. Even after that, you must make numerous login attempts to play.

It forces you to play single player campaign, YET the story is a complete mess. I never felt so disappointed in my life playing a C&C campaign. Reading the reviews I thought it can't be that bad. Guess what, it's worse... Just watch the outro video on YT, and you'll see what I mean.

It tries to be c&c only in its name. It is basically a small-squad-tactics game, sprinkled with minimal special abilities for units. Oh, and said units are boring as HELL. I have 12 hours behind my back, but I couldn't tell the difference between a Zone Trooper and a Zone Enforcer with a gun at my head.

It attempts to be the herald on the MMO era with its ""fast"" pace, but it also falls flat. Dammit, who designed the hotkeys? SHIFT+F5 for a unit construction? Geez... Also, even basic design attempts are failing. Like, I delpoy a Zone Lancer gunner, and then select a new one by double-clicking on it. If I press the deploy hotkey, the newly selected ones deploy, while the deployed ones undeploy... good luck managing that in the midst of battle.

All in all, be glad if you couldn't start that one - nothing can give you back the time you would've wasted on that garbage.","+ runs well on older computers

По скидке в виде завершения истории серии Command and conquer игра смотрится отлично. Сама по себе, пожалуй, сравнима с Dawn of war 3 концептуально (MOBA-вский дух, IceFrog-ом пахнет; к счастью, ареноподобные карты  - единственное сходство с дота-семейством, в остальном похоже на серию Dawn of war - контроль за точками победы) и Dawn of war 2 по содержанию (небольшой лимит юнитов, одно здание производит все войска) и графике. Красивые эффекты взрывов, великолепный дизайн  и огромное разнообразие юнитов, немаленький набор построек, но всего один режим мультиплеера на горстке в целом однотипных карт. P.S. Поражаюсь, почему люди на utube жалуются, мол, не раскрыли все тайны серии в этой игре. Дальше - максимальные спойлеры. Если кто не догадался: портал скриннов был сломан, а сеть контроля тиберия лишила инопланетян стратегического преимущества (хотя ясно, что разработчики просто поленились придумать игру, в которой уникальной внеземной расе вновь нашлось бы достойное место); Кейн - бывший император скриннов в изгнании либо ещё более мощное существо, уже его имя позволяет догадаться, что библейский Каин, сына Адама и Евы, первый убийца (жертва-родной брат Авель) - самое раннее описание главы братства НОД. Перед финальной миссией Кейн намекает главному герою, что ему надоело несколько тысяч лет сидеть на планете Земля (началось всё в пустыне) и развлекаться с людьми, пытаясь управлять развитием их технологий, поэтому он запускает портал в башне скриннов и вместе с братством уматывает домой  по своим делам.",

- Well, after almost 10 years of bad RTS games or no RTS games available at all on the gaming market, I replayed all the series of Command & Conquer and I must say I truly enjoyed playing them for like the seventh time. I could never get from any other recent RTS the same exceptionally good feeling I got in the C&C or Starcraft series.
- If you played the rest of the games in the franchise, you will find this one disconcerting and strange, because the game mechanics are not at all what are you used to.
- Nevertheless, once you master the new mechanisms and accept the fact that spots holding and points counting will make the game shorter than expected or desired, you can still have fun in the game.
- The joy I received from the franchise over the years is the only reason I gave C&C 4 a thumbs-up, since this game had a very unfortunate fate due to the mixed-up system they changed instead of keeping the good old (and proved) game mechanics in the series.
- Still, for an RTS fan, the game was  a must-play marker and can still be enjoyed even in 4K.

其实这款游戏做的很好，音乐非常好听，手感也不错，节奏很快，一打起来非常的热闹

玩法像是命令与征服和英雄连抢点玩法的结合，防御组的玩法很像红警3的TR战术，支援组的飞机也很帅气，后期的大战舰非常的霸气，游戏的血量可以自己设置，游戏其实很好玩。

新玩家不要听信那些所谓的“命令与征服老粉丝”的话，这款游戏很值得一玩，我每一部命令与征服都很喜欢，并且命令与征服全系列的对战我都仔细玩过，真正喜欢命令与征服的玩家是不会跟风黑这款游戏的。

虽然很多年前我第一次在网吧打开这款游戏也是满脸的不解和疑惑，但是多年后想起这款游戏，发现这款游戏意外的好玩。

喜欢命令与征服和RTS以及英雄连的玩家一定要仔细玩玩这款特别的竞技场风格的RTS游戏。",

Постоянно идет ошибка ""general system error"", на что жалуются и американцы, и ру комьюнити (откройте обсуждения к игре и сами все увидите). Из-за этой ошибки мне пришлось устанавливать Origin на свой пк. Создав там учетную запись, активировав ключ игры там (благо он подошел, некоторые жалуются что в стиме и ключ не правильный), скачав этот шлак уже с клиента ориджина, я наконец-то зашел в игру. И боже, я просто ахуел. Я не знаю, как можно было так просрать франшизу. Игра без тиберия просто бессмысленна. Раньше давали 10к тиберия (в среднем) в начале каждой миссии и ты знал, что либо ты обустроишь начальную базу и с помощью аванпоста захватишь еще хранилище, либо миссия проиграна. В этой же части игры просто райткликом клепаешь войска. Я всю компанию за ГДИ прошел одним классом, никакой стратегией в игре просто и не пахнет. Даже видеоролики после каждой миссии смотрятся как говно из жопы, если сравнивать с предыдущими частями франшизы. Минусы в игре можно продолжать перечислять до бесконечности. Простой совет: не покупайте сей шлак, особенно в стиме, где он даже не запускается стабильно. А если и хотите по играть несмотря на все отрицательные отзывы к игре, то ориджин вам в помощь, лучше купите игру там.",

Steam bietet in diesem Fall keine Hilfe und verweist auf den EA Kundensupport der den Support für genau dieses Game Eingestellt zu haben scheint, somit ist es nicht möglich dieses Game auf legalem weg zu Spielen, ein Keygenerator könnte hier vermutlich Abhilfe schaffen, aber da ich solche Programme nicht nutze bleibt dieses Spiel wohl für immer ausserhalb meiner Reichweite.

Edit: Habe das Problem mit dem nicht Funktionierendem Key gelöst, Ihr müsst euch über euren Browser in euer bereits bestehendes EA Konto Einloggen oder ein Konto eröffnen,          

Ihr klickt dann folgendes: Konto Verwalten ---> Code Einlösen, jetzt den Code hier Eintippen oder Reinkopieren,  Wiedeholt auf next klicken bis Key Akzeptiert wurde.

Steam Starten (wenn bereits aktiviert dann neustart machen), C&C4 starten und im folgenden EA Bildschirm normal Einloggen und dann spiel Starten ohne den Key erneut eingeben zu müssen, fertig ;)

However, my greatest disappointment is with the gameplay.

1. Limited population - you can only build 6-7 medium units + 2-4 engineers for repairs. By no means are you able to fully balance out your units and deploy your strategy effectively and every battle becomes a micro management nightmare.

2. Lack of resouce management - to me part of the beauty of past C&C (or any RTS for that matter) is the effective use of limited resource. In this game, you are given unlimited resource to build any amount of units, only constraint being the miserable pop cap in point 1. Half the time in this game you are just spamming cheap cannon fodder units without a care to their surviveabilty.

3. MCV - 3 MCV types that you have to select at start of game and each with their specific units / buildings. For example, you can only build defensive structure if you select the defense MCV and only tank units if you select the offense MCV. To change MCV type mid game you have to basically deconstruct your existing MCV and select a new type. And you can only land it on specific zones! This is a major PITA for me, why can't we have the option to build up my base defense even if my strategy is tank based? 

4. Upgrade path - you can only gain access to certain units / abilities after leveling up and even at end game stage you will not have access to the best units / abilities, even after finishing all the side quests. While this by no means stops you from completing the game, it does not offer you the best experience (unless you are willing to replay completed missions to earn extra exp). The best example is perhaps the final mission for NOD, where you have to destroy a GDI battleship, which basically 2 hits all your basic units. I remember spamming the basic units till the miserable pop cap, watching them shave 4-5%  off the GDI battleship and then dying in less than 3 sec, and then repeat ad naseum.

Overall, this game seems to be a weak & sad attempt by EA to milk a dying cow and is an utter embarrassment to the original C&C.

To gra strategiczna, zaprojektowana przez EA Los Angeles i wydana przez Electronic Arts w 2010 roku. Opowiada o konflikcie na skale światową Bractwa Nod z GDI.

[b]Silnik gry[/b]

Jest mocną stroną gry. Nie posiada żadnych istotnych błędów, które warto byłoby wymienić. Jest bardzo dobrze dopracowany.

[b]Grafika[/b]

To kolejny gigantyczny plus. Grafika na najwyższych wymaganiach jest starannie dociągnięta do najdrobniejszych elementów, co daje wspaniały rezultat wizualny. Jednak wiadomo, że za idealną jakością tekstur idzie odpowieni sprzęt komputerowy.

[b]Muzyka[/b]

Zaprezentowane utwory w przedstawionym produkcie są dobrze dopasowane względem rozgrywki. Oczywiście utwory zmieniają się względem napięcia akcji, co idealnie nastraja gracza do tematyki wojennej przedstawionego tytułu.

[b]Rozgrywka[/b]

Niestety tutaj nie można powiedzieć, że to mocna strona gry. Jeżeli chodzi o porównanie do poprzednich wersji to po prostu będzie niepoprawne, gdyż Command & Conquer 4 jest nastawiony głównie na grę multiplayer. Z każdą napotkaną grą ów serii C&C rozgrywka była dość banalna - zbierasz surowce, które wymieniane są na fundusze, budujesz bazę, werbujesz jednostki piechoty, bądź produkujesz zmechanizowane i starasz się wyeliminować przeciwnika wszelkimi dostępnymi środkami. Natomiast ta część odstaje od normy, gdyż do dyspozycji mamy (nie ważne czy w GDI, czy w NOD) 3 rodzaje budynków głównych. Ofensywny - charakteryzuje się tworzeniem głównie jednostek zmechanizowanych naziemnych, Defensywny - gdzie do werbunku możemy podjąć piechote, oraz Wsparcia - uruchamiając produkcję głównie jednostek latających. Im więcej bitew online, bądź offline rozegramy tym bardziej rośnie poziom naszego awatara, dzięki czemu możemy odblokować różnego rodzaju nowe jednostki, bądź ulepszenia. Tutaj rozgrywka jest ograniczona głównie do nacierania na przeciwnika, bez rozbudowywania flanki defensywnej, bądź bazy. Nie zbiera się surowców, które zapewniają fundusze na produkcję wojska, po prostu wybieramy jeden z trzech rodzajów ruchomego budynku głównego, produkujemy (za darmo)  takie wojsko jakie uważamy za słuszne i rozpoczynamy jak najszybszy atak. Największą wadą jest brak zaawansowanego wiersza poleceń, który mocno ułatwiłby rozgrywkę.

[b]Fabuła[/b]

Kane stara się za wszelką cenę dostąpić wniebowstąpienia, za pomocą wieży pozostawionej przez kosmiczą rasę scrinów. GDI za wszelką cenę stara się stłumić zamieszki spowodowane wysłannikami bractwa NOD i nie ma zamiaru pozwolić Kane'owi na spełnienie swojego celu, czy uda im się powstrzymać fanatycznego przywódcę bractwa?

[b]Reasumując, do plusów gry możemy zaliczyć:[/b]
[list]
[*]poprawność w sferze fabularnej
[*]czas potrzebny do zakończenia wątku
[*]mocno intensywną akcję podczas rozgrywki
[*]wciągającą fabułę
[*]innowacyjny pomysł rozgrywki, który mocno różni się od każdej poprzedniej części serii C&C.
[/list]
[b]Natomiast do ewidentnych minusów trzeba zaliczyć:[/b]
[list]
[*]strasznie wygórowaną cenę względem tego co oferuje produkt
[*]brak zaawansowanego wiersza poleceń, który ułatwiłby w wielu sytuacjach rozgrywkę
[*]bardzo uproszczoną rozgrywkę.
[/list]
[b]Moim zdaniem[/b]

Zaprezentowany produkt Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight jest tytułem godnym polecenia i wartym uwagi, po mimo tego, że rozgrywka nie jest świetna to fabuła i efekty specjalne, jak również i tempo akcji zaprezentowane przez twórców przechylają szalę tej części z serii C&C na pozytywną stronę.

42006008,russian,2018.04.13 01:50,❌,✅,0.6780002117,18,"Очень сложно непредвзято оценить эту игру, являясь фанатом серии C&C (а не орать от увиденного матом на своего кота, потому что больше то и не на кого выместить всё негодование, но кот то и не при чем, и сидит он потом думает где же я опять нассал не так)

Главная фишка серии игр - живые видеоролики. С одной стороны, видеоролики в своём качестве стали на порядок выше, актёры начали по-настоящему играть, это уже больше не та клоунада как в порнушных роликах перед основным действом (вспомнить актёрскую игру из предыдущей части... Даже в убогих русских сериалах про ментов качество игры актёров лучше в гигалиарды раз). С другой стороны, совершенно ни капельки, ни грамулечки, ни песчиночки, ни ху яшечки не понятно что там вообще, мать того за ногу, происходит. Помимо этого, многие моменты настолько абсурдные и нелепые, что залезаешь в стим в поисках ДЛС к этой игре, по которому вам отсыпят немного дури, вкуренной в процессе написания сценария.

Может быть, это я такой придирчивый и невнимательный, допускаю, но я ни черта не понял сюжета, начиная с первого видеоролика, и заканчивая последним. Буду благодарен, если кто-то расскажет, что там на самом деле происходило.

Оценить геймплей в полной мере, возможно, мне помешает прохождение игры в одиночку. Как я понял, она рассчитана на кооп. Поэтому скажу только о своем опыте одиночной игры. [strike]ПОЛНОЕ ГОВ НИЩЕ[/strike] Геймплей довольно экспериментальный и необычный. Вместо типичной стратегии, к которой мы все привыкли, динамику боёв решили раскрутить, и лишили нас построек, базы, добычи ресурсов, штампования тысячного воинства и подобных плюшек, за которые мы любили C&C. Вместо этого, нам дали гигантскую черепашку, разрешили нон-стопом рожать из неё максимум 10-15 бойцов, которыми мы должны разруливать любой конфликт. Нет больше супер-оружия, нет масштабных боёв и харвестеров. Да и тиберий здесь нужен только чтобы его схватить, залететь с ним в руках в толпу врагов и подорваться. Сам по себе такой режим игры интересный, и к нему нет никаких претензий. Но игроки явно ожидали от C&C совсем не этого. Будь он каким-нибудь отдельным режимом игры, то проблем не было бы вообще никаких.

Дизайн. Графическая составляющая отступила на несколько шагов назад от предыдущей части. Юниты выглядят как игрушки из лего, сама графика стала более яркой и мультяшной (особенно спецэффекты), интерфейс стал максимально убогим, каким не был в этой серии игр вообще никогда. И если с ред алертом подобный дизайн игры прокатил, т.к. игра сама по себе является карикатурной и шутливой, то у серии тибериума совершенно другой посыл. Без шуток. Всё серьёзно. С игрушками из лего.

А вот саундтрек действительно порадовал. Многим не понравились ""цыганские завывания"" на фоне НОДов, а мне показалось это очень клёвым и уместным, учитывая, что эта группировка собралась как раз в этих странах. 

В итоге мы имеем игру среднего качества, которую загнала в могилу аббревиатура C&C. Не будь этой аббревиатуры, положительных обзоров было бы намного больше.",

Кампания заделана на ура(можно даже с другом пройти);
Схватка (да это не тибериум, где баталии, а захват и удержание точек, но мне понравилось);
Графика;
Музыка за НОД;
Прокачка и улучшения.
-
Войска(половина не понравились);
Нету моих любимых ""инопланетян"" (т.е. бои только между ГДИ и НОД);
Один командный центр, который теперь с пушками при прокачке(при достижении определенного уровня), однако это для меня не минус, но всё-таки не плюс.

如果这款游戏能等到2017年发售，想必不会是现在的差评如潮
如果这款游戏能冠以：“红色警戒3番外-泰伯利亚王者”  这个名字，而不是命令与征服4，亦或不会是现在的窘境。

放一个资源：这个地图能帮助你快速升到20级 https://pan.baidu.com/s/1dGHwNbb

断断续续玩了一段时间，一直没有明白这款游戏到底是在做什么，然而偶尔玩了一把王者荣耀，不禁感慨，这游戏真的是出的太早了，当时的人们无法理解这个游戏的玩法，而把他简单的认为像以往的命令与征服一样，造一堆部队推过去就赢了。

基地传送时间=“敌军还有十秒到达战场”，
选择MCV类型 攻击，防御，辅助=“战士，法师，团控”，
请登陆EA账户=“召唤师，请先登陆”
20级解锁科技=XX级解锁治疗，XX级解锁奔跑，25级解锁闪现
不能碾压=我没听说关羽可以碾压
有人口限制=我没听说王者荣耀可以控制多个英雄
占领泰伯利亚网络中心获得点数=摧毁水晶获得胜利
5v5=5v5
收集泰伯利亚获得科技升级=打野升级出装

这款游戏与王者荣耀百分之60的相似度，为什么不好玩，是因为，亲爱的指挥官，你用命令与征服传统的视角去看这款游戏
这款游戏的画风和红色警戒3一样
这款游戏不叫命令与征服4，它叫：红色警戒3番外-泰伯利亚王者

Не долго думая я решил приобрести все игры C&C 3. Оказалось, что EA выпустило продолжение этой саги - C&C 4: Tiberian Twilight и я решил, что и её тоже необходимо приобрести, но когда перешёл на страницу с отзывами - я начал сомневаться в целесообразности данной покупки, т.к. отзывы были крайне негативные. Почитал их. Ну, думаю, куплю всё-равно, благо если покупать комплектом все игры данной серии, то скидка покрывала большую часть стоимости 4й части. Всё же хотелось верить в то, что фанатам просто не понравилась новая механика, я же не был столь строгим консерватором и решил дать игре шанс. Каково же было моё разочарование когда я начал в неё играть, предварительно пройдя C&C 3... Такой скучной и неинтересной стратегии-кликера мне ещё не попадалось... Даже Кейн не смог хоть сколько-нибудь сгладить негативного впечатления от этой поделки. Сюжет ни о чём, ролики унылые и неинтересные, миссии скучные, а иногда и нудные когда нужно кругами бегать за вражескими краулерами. Проходил на высоком уровне сложности, может быть это добавило дополнительного негатива - не знаю, но в C&C 3 это только усиливало положительные эмоции! Ну да, а тут, выходит, усиливало отрицательные... В общем я не советую фанатам играть в эту игру, уж лучше прочтите на Википедии или ещё где-нибудь сюжет и надейтесь на выход когда-нибудь в светлом будущем адекватной 5й части.

I actually played it when it came out, well played a pirated copy lol, and I actually enjoyed it! I played Command and Conquer Red Alert and Command and Conquer 3, both of em, so I understood the ""basics"" of this series. So I was a bit shocked seeing the gameplay go from base builder to something like Homeworld.

However, I must say that Tiberium Twilight, if we ignore the campaign, isn't so bad! It just feels... unfinished at times in comparison to CnC 3.
What sucks is that I can't get past the in game login screen with the disconnected pop up always preventing me from getting into the game. 

So if  there is a way to have this ""disconnecting"" issue resolved I would appreciate that! Thank you.

EDIT:
Managed to make it work and, after playing some more, I can definitely say: the gameplay is still as fun as I remember! My issue though is that the games are either too slow or too fast. Sometimes you can't even reach Tier 3 and other times you're fully upgraded, 70/70 supply, and just juggling units until one side reaches the higher number.

To conclude: The game is aight. If you like Homeworld this could make you feel a bit at home with the gameplay, but if you're looking for a base builder akin to old CnC, this ain't it. I'd recommend getting this when it's on sale for around $10 or $15.

So I was a bit shocked seeing the gameplay go from base builder to something like Homeworld.

However, I must say that Tiberium Twilight, if we ignore the campaign, isn't so bad! It just feels... unfinished at times in comparison to CnC 3.
What sucks is that I can't get past the in game login screen with the disconnected pop up always preventing me from getting into the game. 

So if  there is a way to have this ""disconnecting"" issue resolved I would appreciate that! Thank you.

EDIT:
Managed to make it work and, after playing some more, I can definitely say: the gameplay is still as fun as I remember! My issue though is that the games are either too slow or too fast. Sometimes you can't even reach Tier 3 and other times you're fully upgraded, 70/70 supply, and just juggling units until one side reaches the higher number.

To conclude: The game is aight. If you like Homeworld this could make you feel a bit at home with the gameplay, but if you're looking for a base builder akin to old CnC, this ain't it. I'd recommend getting this when it's on sale for around $10 or $15.

A solid 6.9/10. Grind and then forget... and then come back just to screw around lol."

CNC4就如同HOMM4，如果你能接受英雄无敌4之于英雄无敌3、5的差距，也就可能可以接受CNC4之于CNC2、3甚至RA的差距。
CNC4确实做到了非常高度的平衡性和竞技性，以致于整个游戏几乎变成了dead game，几乎毫无娱乐性可言，但这确实是一个了不起的设想，把即时战略和策略糅合在一起，只不过就如同英雄无敌4一样，游戏在还有润色空间的情况下就发布了........
剧情，甚至都不如西木时代，好吧，其实只是和CNC3的断代过于显著了，Kane的人设变动以及塔西图斯的设定变动，让剧情变得不知所云，加上两大阵营最后几章的过场电影，scrin塔里白白的一片，和那个非常突兀的传送门............想想西木，想想CNC3.......

在我心目中EA确实毁了CNC系列，CNC4也是蛇尾之作，而且也不会再有CNC5，加上非常愚蠢和某碧有得一拼的高级土豆服务器，形同虚设极其愚蠢的指挥官经验值系统（这是个收集养成类卡牌游戏没错），以及愚蠢的让你想要删游戏的敌我AI差距，这确实是一部极其糟糕的CNC。

他给我们打开了一扇通往新的CNC世界的大门，只是，这扇门摇摇欲坠，也并不美观，于是，谁也不想再走过去了。

对，EA甚至都不想高清重置CNC1、2和RA1、2。

Из плюсов разве что:

- Оборонительные башенки и некоторые постройки смотрятся достаточно красиво

- Ну и ввиду применения движка с Red Alert 3 масовки стали выглядеть чуть более красочно чем в 3 части

- Заставочки вроде все так же хороши как и в предыдущей игре

- Не плохо сделаны карты в какой-то степени (на мой взгляд), хотя они и создают ощущение ""скованности""
 
  На этом пожалуй плюсы заканчиваются...

Из минусов:

- Отсутствие базы как таковой, приходтся ходить альтернативной версией АТ-АТ и ""рожать"" себе юнитов, которые кстати впервые за все время ограничены...

- Новый движок с Red Alert 3, движок не спорю не плох, НО ОН НЕЛОХ ДЛЯ RED ALERT ИСТОРИИ, А НЕ ДЛЯ ТИБЕРИЯ, ввиду этого после 3 части кажется что зашел в какой-то жалкий плагиат на замечательную серию...

- Возможно я сейчас жутко предираюсь, НО в развед информации в прошлой игре говорилось что ГСБ ПОЧТИ ПОЛНОСТЬЮ ОТКАЗАЛАСЬ ОТ ШАГАЮЩЕЙ ТЕХНИКИ ПОСЛЕ ВТОРОЙ ВОЙНЫ ЗА ТЕБЕРИЙ, не считая джагернаута, а что тут??? ШАГАЮЩАЯ ТЕХНИКА ВЕЗДЕ НАХЕР, как по мне это довольно нелепо...

- Ретекстурирование танка ""Скорпион"".... я когда впервые его увидел меня почти сразу же вывернуло, настолько мне показалось это высером... так же как и ретекстурирование танка ""Призрак""... 

- ХМ...ЧТО ЭТО? СЕРИЯ ИГР ЗАВЯЗАННАЯ НА ДОБЫЧЕ ТИБЕРИЯ?? А ДАВАЙТЕ УБЕРЕМ ВОЗМОЖНОСТЬ ЕГО ДОБЫВАТЬ, ВОТ ВЕСЕЛО БУДЕТ И ОСТАВЛЯТЬ БУДЕМ ПО НЕСКОЛЬКО КУСОЧКОВ НА УРОВЕНЬ, ДА И ПОХЕР ЧТО ОН ПОЧТИ ПОЛНОСТЬЮ ЗАРАЗИЛ И ОТРАВИЛ ЗЕМЛЮ И РАСТЕТ ВЕЗДЕ И ПРОИЗВОДИТ ТОКСИНЫ ОБРАЩАЮЩИЕ ЛЮДЕЙ В МУТАНТОВ...ХМ...МУТАНТЫ?....НЕ, НАХЕР И ИХ ОТСЮДА....ТАК ШО ТУТ ИНТЕРФЕЙС ПРИЯТНЫЙ БЫЛ В ПРЕДЫДУЩЕЙ ЧАСТИ ГОВОРИТЕ, ХОРОШО, МЫ ЕГО ДОПИЛИМ...ТАК ЭТО НАХЕР...ЭТО ТОЖЕ...А?

　　总评：7.4分

　　整体评价：

　　看到开发组和发行商冒着危险继续推出已经多少有些过时的游戏题材，这样的感觉还不错。《命令与征服》传统的游戏机制相信大家已经非常熟悉了。如果他们继续，就必须要做出一些改变。EA洛杉矶这次并没有仅仅对画面和其他内容进行精加工，而是彻底重写了游戏的规则，让大家体会到了颠覆性的感觉。《命令与征服4》据称是泰伯利亚题材的最后一部。在游戏中你将体验到节奏飞快的基于不同兵种的实时策略战斗。  基地是可移动的，而Tiberium矿产也消失了，而获得分数是你的主要目标。游戏节奏飞快，十分混乱，因此说在线团队游戏一定非常有趣。可惜，游戏的战役模式设置不合理，想法不错但是又根本没有必要的解锁系统限制了游戏的整体表现。

　　众媒体点评：

　　gamingxp：87/100，优异

　　“作为一款历史悠久的知名系列的完结作，《命令与征服4》的表现恰如其分，一个老故事传奇般的结束以及注入大量新鲜的元素……最让我感到印象深刻的是，游戏营造的战场氛围，这方面表现极其成功，这得益于高质量的视频效果以及一个令人深思的故事安排，这让玩家有很强的代入感，并且能立刻沉浸在战场上。玩家可以看到破败或壮观的城市，包含大量细节的，代表市民文化的东西，比如广告牌，电线杆或者汽车，当然，这些事物对游戏本身并没有直接的影响，但长久以来，正是这种良好的氛围才塑造了命令与征服今日的地位。”


　　gamepro：80/100，不错

　　“排除了恼人的DRM签名管理问题，命令与征服4的游戏体验无疑是令人愉快的，当然，铁杆玩家或许不能接受爬行者以及不能采矿的改变，但是想法开放的玩家应该给游戏一个机会，开发者试图为游戏开辟一个崭新的发展方向，而这一劳动成果显然值得我们去体验！”

　　“总的来说，爬行者系统运转良好，多人游戏表现稳定，持续性的升级和解锁设置，很容易让玩家沉迷于此，此外，游戏的故事，显然可以让老玩家感到满意……当然，游戏的缺点也清晰可见，需要时刻接入互联网，并且一些地图上，会出现一些导致不平衡现象的发生。”


　　pcgamer：73/100

　　“公平的说，如果这款游戏的名字中没有包含“4”，那一定会是一个皆大欢喜的结果，因为玩家总是对所谓的终结之作抱有极高的期待，而这款游戏的表现显然达不到这种程度。我们认为游戏中的很多探索，设计初衷应该是一款网络游戏……不过考虑到这款游戏即便是单人任务，都需要接入EA的服务器，我们希望玩家谨慎对待，不要忘记发售还不到两年的雇佣兵2，刚刚被EA停服，我们不能够买一款心仪的产品，还要担心网络服务是否能持续很久。没错，游戏的多人部分非常出彩，但是我们头顶上悬着的达摩克利斯之剑也令人担忧！”",

A C&C 4 nem olyan játék, mint amit megszokhattak a játékosok az előző részeknél. Itt nincs begyűjtés, jelentősebb építkezés sem, csupán elfoglalható létesítméynek. Mindennek ellenére nem lenne olyan rossz a játék, ha a küldetéseket lehetne egyjátékos módban játszani. Sajnos mint utóbb kiderült, a negyedik küldetés lehetetlen egyjátékos módban, mivel akkora az ellenség túlereje, hogy egyedül induló játékost lenyomja a gép mint a csikket. ""Solo"" lehetőség félrevezetés! Limit van minden játékosnál, ami 50-es. Akkor lenne esély a győzelemre, ha ez nem lenne. Limittel pedig képtelenség elég egységet vezényelni az óriás hajó elpusztítására. (NOD)
GDI kampányt ki sem próbáltam, gyanítom ott is csak az első 2-3 küldetés játszható egyjátékosban, azután a túlerő megekasztja a sztorit. nagyon valószínű, hogy a kampány előrehaladtával a párban induló játékosok összhadereje is kevés lenne, mivel alapból három féle bázis választható ki: Védekezés, támadás, támogatás. Egyik sem alkalmas a küldetések megoldására emberhiányban. Öszintén szólva biztos voltam benne, hogy mivel solo kületés módban vagyok, leskálázódik az ellenséges haderő, de nem. Nem segít az alacsonyabb nehézségi szint választása sem. El kell fogadni, hogy ez egy kizárólag többjátékos kaland.

A zene fasza mint mindíg, de ez nem nyújt vígaszt.

There are three major reasons why this game is an awful buy, I believe it was a waste of money due to how horrible the three things are.
1) the RTS from the original games allowed for full unit usage. What I mean is you where not limited to what you could play with depending on the structure you choose durring a deploy phase. Yep you are limited in your units as to which of three main stuctures you choose. While this was a great idea you can only deploy one crawler at a time where enmies in the main story can deploy more. This makes the game play fustratingly difficult.
2) The severly limited pop cap, Ok population caps are important but in the game the pop cap is 50.... units beyond basic crap units are 6 or higher. This is awlful considering how limited and how long it takes to produce said units. In pvp this can be a fustrating experance. In story mode it is even more so due to the fact each crawler of an opponate has its own cap of 50.
3) You do not build.... Ok bar the previous two issues this is my main problem with this game command and conquer is a paced building war machine... this means you start a map with little and you slowly conquer it with a play style that suits your personal abilities. In this game pushing with a large force not happening you cant build multiple development buldings. Want to tower it up? fuck no if your not in the defence crawler, oh and btw these towers blow ass. No i mean seriously they take shit loads of damage from units and do little to no damage to units that they dont directly counter.
Please if you plan to buy this... crap that came out of some programers ass reconsider you will most likely end up regreting the purchuse as i have.","So Id like to go on a extreamly long rant on how they ruined this great series but ill just give you the simple facts.

Pros:
-Kane
-New Tactics
-Kane
-Forgiving game with mistakes
-Uninstallation button
-Did I mention Kane?

Truth be told, there isn't a lot of good things about this game! I played it for as long as I could before I just told myself no! I can't play this anymore! My goal was to play it to see what happened at the end of the game, and for $5, it seems reasonable to waste your money on something so cheap. However, even going into this game KNOWING it's trash, I still couldn't finish it! It was that bad! If you're curious about the ending, just look up the campaign cutscenes through YouTube or something. Do yourself a favor and keep that $5. 

But for the few positive things I did say about it, it is true that Kane (Joseph Kucan) is the only set in stone thing that's worth the buy here. The man's entire life is based on this gaming franchise, and every CaC fan should pay respect to this man's future in this game considering it went downhill for CaC after this game's release. The game also offers new tactics with the Crawler unit that you have to protect now. 

So instead of base building (you know, the thing that made the Command and Conquer gaming franchise famous), you now have this Crawler, and the missions are now turned to escort missions rather than destroying your enemy base! But nevertheless, if you lose a Crawler in battle, do not fret! You get to respawn a new Crawler in a designated area that the AI doesn't know about and you don't have to start over the mission! Yay! All the Crawler does is turn itself into a construction yard and build units to defend it, that's all! No buildings, no Tiberium, no fun! All the player could do with the Crawler is choose between 3 classes, Offence, Defense, and Support. And even though the tutorial gives you all the classes special abilities and whatnot, you have to earn experience points to unlock the simplest abilities! So you're forced to go back and play the same damn missions again and again! 

Ugh! If you look up the interview the developers had once the CaC4 was released, they talked about how RTS games are getting tedious, and how they thought this new change would help it. The problem there is that you don't simply change the entire gameplay that the franchise was founded on. Other games like the Red Alert trilogy, CaC3, CaC General Zero Hour, CaC Tiberium Sun and many others continued to show off the wonderful RTS experience that CaC4 completely killed! You can't do that under the CaC name, you just can't. EA forever killed this franchise, so have fun with their last game if you're still very interested in it. But for the market value of $20, don't even think of purchasing it! It's not worth it! 

If you want to know the negatives, here you go:
Cons:
-Tedious gameplay
-Boring campaign
-Multiplayer servers are down
-Useless units
-No Tiberium collection
-Always have to sign into EA when you start up the game
-No base building
-Last CaC game ever
-Crawler unit
-Cap amount on units made
-Experience system for the simplest abilities
-Acting was mediocre
-Killed CaC franchise
-Too expensive at retail price
-No other known actors
-No cool looking costumes
-Graphics are meh
-Having to review such a good franchise dead
-No one likes the game
-No one will play with you
-Screw you developers, you suck
-Don't
-Buy
-This
-Game
-It
-Sucks
-Balls
-And

But for the market value of $20, don't even think of purchasing it! It's not worth it! 

If you want to know the negatives, here you go:
Cons:
-Tedious gameplay
-Boring campaign
-Multiplayer servers are down
-Useless units
-No Tiberium collection
-Always have to sign into EA when you start up the game
-No base building
-Last CaC game ever
-Crawler unit
-Cap amount on units made
-Experience system for the simplest abilities
-Acting was mediocre
-Killed CaC franchise
-Too expensive at retail price
-No other known actors
-No cool looking costumes
-Graphics are meh
-Having to review such a good franchise dead
-No one likes the game
-No one will play with you
-Screw you developers, you suck
-Don't
-Buy
-This
-Game
-It
-Sucks
-Balls
-And
-Ass!"

  CNC4的名字取得好，泰伯利亚的黄昏，也是这个系列的黄昏。
  我并不是一个铁杆的CNC粉，我最早接触的RTS是星际，所以反而CNC4的有上限游戏模式是我比较能接受的。但是不得不说CNC4的缺陷太大了，红警3是复制西木的产物，而泰伯利亚的黄昏则是不想复制西木的产物，比起以前的CNC系列甚至是RTS，CNC4几乎成了四不像，甚至连采集资源都没有。对一个长期扎根于帝国时代和星际里面的玩家来说，这是无法接受的地方，一切就只凸显在队伍安排与微操（换弹夹）上面，游戏性非常差。剧情也有很大的缺陷，接不上三代的剧情。所以说，CNC4只是西木过后EA洛杉矶对RTS一次笨拙的尝试。

Its painful to even be on this storepage writing this review. I can honestly feel a tiny twinge of a headache coming on so i'll get to my points.

Command & Conquer, as a series, is one of the grandfathers of all modern base-building RTS games up there with Warcraft as well. While the series saw a few minor adjustments to the lore here 'n there it was always a very solid setting whose factions i'll cover briefly:

The Brotherhood of Nod is/was a paramilitary organization with ties to just about every major country that isn't afflicted w/ Tiberium or the first world ""Blue zones"". It's ranks are comprised not JUST of hundreds of millions of loyal militia but also extremely well-trained and well organized black ops infiltrators and die-hard fantical soldiers. Lead by ""Kane"", while it was never openly announced, it was highly alluded to that he was in fact the mythical brother of Abel from the bible, thus meaning he has existed since almost the literal dawn of time. While Kane was always viewed as EXTREMELY charismatic, he was also astoundingly cunning and a survivor above all, surviving not one but 2 seperate attacks from WMD-scale orbital weapons platforms despite being at the ground-zero of both attacks.

In C&C 4 this appears to have all been retconned and it now alludes that Kane is an alien seeking to go home.

The Global Defense Initiative (or GDI) is effectively the UN/NATO and every other western first-world 3 or 4 letter organization all smashed into one giant organization. GDI are essentially ""The good guys"", the Free world all gathered together to try and stomp out The Brotherhood of Nod and stop Tiberium from spreading across the globe, the highly toxic green crystal has turned much of the planet into an uninhabitable hellscape labled ""Red Zones"" and semi-infested zones (Yellow zones) both of which Nod operates out of predominantly.

Now, as mentioned previously, base-building was extremely important in previous games because your resources were rarely directly inside your base and could deplete rapidly, creating a NEED to control the map's terrain to move to new fields while the expended ones slooooowly regenerated. There was also the matter that air units had to return to the structure that created them to resupply, even the very use of your minimap was a feature given by one of your buildings.

Here, thats no longer the case, base building has been entirely removed and replaced with different 'styles' of command structure, restricting access to what units you can produce. It takes away a huge aspect of the game for the sake of trying to make the game more 'user friendly' but instead only takes away from the experience.

On top of this, C&C 4 was the ending to the story of Kane as far as we were told, it is the conclusion......and it's endings answers precisely zero plot questions despite more and more cropping up as the series progressed. Theres also the matter that the game tries to shoe-horn in a Co-Op experience, something none of the previous games did and while good on paper, it fails to make up for the rest of the game's failures.

In short, C&C 4 neutered a major part of what made the earlier games unique, failed to deliver any note-worthy answers to questions that'd existed since the series began over a decade ago and left most (if not all) of it's fans (as is probably apparent by the reviews) with a very very sour taste in our mouths.","Foreward: Time listed played for this title does not reflect full play-time w/ game, have completed both campaigns.

The biggest issue is EA's attempt to ""introduce a multitude of innovations to the classic fast and fluid Command & Conquer gameplay"". BIG MISTAKE! A bit of fine tuning or maybe a single change would have been fine and accepted by the masses but attempting to turn the entire RTS genre on it's head from it's root origins way back in Dune 2: Battle for Arrakis/Building a Dynasty (yep I owned both and argued with friends about the title) was a bad idea that wasn't play tested enough and then when executed signaled the death bell of this otherwise Glorious Franchaise.

Audio/Sound: 10/10. The sound engineering and audio in the game is freaking brilliant. The music is absoluting amazing and soulful with each battle/mission. The menu music almost makes you feel like you're in some form of command centre and the troops are awaiting your orders to throw themselves into the fray. It's very thematic and is done well, even the FMV have an excellent tone to them.

Video: 8/10. The visuals are fantastic. The FMV have always been top notch (ignoring Tiberium Dawn's blue-screen era) and they don't disappoint. But while in game I can't help but feel the visuals got a severe downgrade from the E3 trailers and previews. Not sure if it was a QA or coding issue that changed this but it was a bit of a disappointment. But still the game looks great compred to some of the RTS clones out there.

Gameplay: 4/10. Sadly this is where it all goes to hell. It is C&C. But it's not the RTS we want. Or the one we deserve. Mobile fluid command structures aren't anything new. Dark Reign, Supreme Commander and a few others have done this before and always to a varying degree of failure when it comes to reception of the players. Why they decided to follow this course is a mystery... maybe they did want the franchaise to end and die? Why? No idea.

To non-C&C fans of RTS games I must suggest that you avoid this. To the C&C fans whom want to see an ending... well I'm a hardcore fan and played them all back to back(even Renegade) before getting to this game and for me it was worth it to get an ending. If you're not that keen but want to see an ending then I suggest youtube'ing the FMV cinematics but you probably won't get the same impact.

I will say this having an end boss fight was unexpected and a nice twist and the GDI bring the pain with their ultimate super-heavy vehicle (no spoilers I promise) but holy heck it kicks butt and took me 26 minutes to bring down... yep it's that tough but then again I like to play on stupidly hard cause I'm a sucker for pain... hrm maybe that's why I liked the game.

A Mini 'Rebview'!!

Do you like real-time strategy games?
Did you while away hours, just playing skirmish maps  throughout the C&C franchise ?
Did you marvel at the hammy acting and silly stories in the campaign and test friendships in vs battles?
Did you enjoy managing your base and slowly wresting control of the map from your opponents, all the while protecting your harvesters and amassing your forces for that planned overwhelming assault? 
Is Command and Conquer 4 the game for you?
Nope, probably not. 

Thanks for reading, check my other reviews.

What!!?

What do you mean that's not good enough? 

Okay then, second time's a charm....
Do you hate previous Command and Conquer games and wish they never existed? 
Did you play level 7 of Dune 2 as a child and decide if you can't have a base nobody should?
Do you think innovation within a franchise should automatically mean a complete and utter deviation from that franchise's core mechanics? 
Do you get a sense of inner fulfillment when EA takes over other studios and then homogenizes and dumbs their properties down?
Then this might be the game for you..... 
You monster. 

Firstly, sorry to the live action actors, they acted their little hearts out.
And now the dirty work.... 
The game itself 'features' a perspective limited to about 3ft off the ground.
Replacing bases and harvesters is a crawler mechanic done better elsewhere.
The crawler acts as a mobile HQ that can deploy sort of acting like a base, but not.
Limited unit selection is improved slightly as each of the 3 crawlers for the two factions has a selection of unique abilities and units - providing a thin façade of choice - so long as your choice doesn't involve wanting to play a Command and Conquer game!

The game does look good for its age and still had a bunch of people playing it online, but based on my time with the game I'm forced to assume they get some sort of masochistic thrill from sticking with it, but far be it from me to kink shame.

The units may look acceptable but the tiny unit cap in the missions I played was not, the game may have merits when considered as its own thing, but as a long time fan of the franchise and Westwood's work it pains me to see the Command and Conquer title connected to this game.

C&C 4 is a compelling Asylum B movie, tethered to a game forged by an exact and precise series of awful decision; like an entire solar system whose planets orbit comes into alignment once every billion years and unleashes some dark force, Command and Conquer 4 came into being- spawned from a heady mix of EA's contempt for the franchise and a desire for accessibility that seemingly took precedence at every stage of designing the games mechanics.  

If you are new to the franchise or enjoyed Homeworld Deserts of Karak it might be worth playing but as a Command and Conquer fan I'd be honoured to recomend that nobody play this game, ever, not even for nostalgia.... 

Thanks for the read and if you enjoyed this feedback is always appreciated.

With this game, Command and Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight, electronic arts put forth their single greatest INSULT to the gaming community, and ultimately one of the dumbest business decisions in gaming history. In a pathetic, short sighted attempt at trying to push the highly coveted Command And Conquer brand onto a new generation of gamer, they have destroyed everything CNC has stood for.

In order to appeal to a NEW playerbase of (GUESSTIMATE) 50 000-80 000 players from a NEW generation of gamers, they have created a fast paced RTS that is so heavily disconnected from the ENTIRE CNC genre up to this point, it is unrecognizeable as an actual command and conquer title, and more closely resembles a next-gen mobile-tower defense game.

In doing so, EA Games made its BIGGEST mistake. In order to appeal to a NEW small audience, they ALIENATED the older audience which comprises over two MILLION players, probably more. From both a lore standpoint and shockingly a business standpoint, CNC4 was a BIG mistake.

While CNC 4 is in itself a good game for what it is, not a true RTS but more an RTS based mobile tower defense game. Good graphics, good gameplay, good story, brilliant unit balancing, as always to be expected from a CNC title. But, the game is NOT command and conquer. The original CNC games were base building, calling on MASSIVE armies of PC shattering numbers of units into HUGE, tiny or small battlefields.

THAT is what the players of the CNC series grew up with. Thats what they fell in love with. THAT gameplay mechanic of building a fortress and a massve army was what drove CNC fans down its very long history to make it one of if not THE greatest RTS-defining franchises in gaming history.

Command and Conquer universe - with the exception of CNC Renegade (an FPS based in the tiberium universe) - has been defined by base building, resource management, resource collection, base defense, tactical decisions and heavy strategy that have molded playstyles that have blown away other RTS games, and even set the precedent on what to beat for the entire RTS gaming industry.

Command and Conquer Generals and its extension Zero Hour, STILL have a loyal fan base, online community and very extensive modding community that, years on, is still loyally playing a game they've had for ages, completely ignoring anything NEW you try to produce. Most true CNC fans will buy CNC4 because its command and conquer, but will NEVER play it after the first few times logging in.

But, for now i shall leave you with the following review of CNC4 Tib Twilight:

For what it is, it's a good, fun game.

Good Graphics.
Good gameplay.
Good story.
Good skirmish modes.
Challenging AI.

But these do not excuse it. It is NOT command and conquer, and for this reason

I DO NOT CONSIDER THIS GAME, CNC4 TIBERIAN TWILIGHT, TO BE CANON TO THE CNC FRANCHISE.

30307058,english,2017.02.04 08:12,❌,✅,0.5,1,"Greetings!  I’m going to say something that doesn’t seem the norm based off the reviews of this game.  I liked this game.  I’ve always been a fan of Command & Conquer and although this game definitely isn’t my favorite it does seem to hold up pretty well.

Graphics:  No, these graphics aren’t amazing but they do hold up from when the game first came out.  I can’t really complain as they were pretty amazing when the game first came out, they hold up pretty well.  Battle damage is still present and the particle effects are still pretty good. I’d love to see more RTS do battle damage and such.

Mechanics:  I have to compare this to a modern product and with that said the mechanics do hold up tolerably but I keep going back to the gold standard of controls for RTS:  StarCraft 2.  I wish RTS would just look at the standard SC2 has set and make that their minimum.  Yes, you need innovation but you should start at least with the core.  I did find the unit selection double press feature very useful (on press you select all combat units, double and you select all units).  If I was rating this completely on mechanics I’d probably be more in the not recommend as the controls have not kept up in the world of precision, to many times I couldn’t move a unit too close to something or his pathing would lead him somewhere completely opposite of where I wanted him to go.  And…one game type for skirmish?  Really? Sigh.

RPG:  I wish more games would include some of the leveling features that this game has, I’d love to see a mode where you level up and unlock new units, or include veterancy.  Yes, I know these aren’t very ‘competitive’ features, so maybe make them toggled or their own game type.  In fact, the core design of this game (the mobile base building and focus on less units and more action) would be an amazing game type for RTS but kind of falls flat as the core component.  Ultimately, I would have loved to see this game take off more so if nothing else these game types would have continued on.

Story:  Unfortunately, this story felt the most forgettable over all the other C&C games.  I know I beat this when it first came out but for the life of me didn’t remember any of the story, I actually remember the story of most of the C&C world but this one slipped me.  I’m not sure if they weren’t trying but it actually felt more like a game copying the C&C world than a C&C game.

Ultimately, I am cycling between a positive or negative review.  I look at everything and see more negative thoughts than positive, but this game is 6 years old and I just replayed the campaign and overall enjoyed it… but I love C&C.  Should you buy this?  Eh, if you like C&C yes, if you are just looking for a good RTS I’d look elsewhere or go back in time 6 years and play it when it comes out.","Greetings!

1.) This version of CnC greatly move in a different gameplay of RTS compare to other CnC. SO DIFFERENT. I pretty much understand those who say that the classic CnC gameplay is much  better since it was the one that they got to play since their childhood (Nostalgia factor is a plus). This version greatly rewarded those who knows a little bit of micro-managing (Especially those who are good in that matter). New gameplay, new strategies, new tactics.

2.) EA launch this game in Steam via 3rd party software, which you have to make an account with EA to play it. I got no problem doing that as I have a lot of games doing that in my Steam library, however the create new account link in launch program is broken, so you have to go directly to the site (minor inconvinience). Other thing, creating new account is pretty much a pain in the neck depending on your location, so I have to activate my VPN (Germany) to successfully make a new account. This could make those who are kinda not informed what VPN is lose interest in playing this game.

3.) You can not play this without internet connection, as you have to login everytime you launch this game. Big minus point.

I played this game until I finished GDI and NOD Brotherhood path. I quite say that I got the game mechanic and game play after few games (due to the fact that compare to other CnC, this version is like entirely another game). If you'll give it some time, it's enjoying. Hard and rewarding. Although the campaign was so short that if you have no other friend to play with, this gonna go lame very fast.

Oh, and a lot of people are rampantly cheating coz of weak-ass anti-cheat system of EA.

Эта была одна из первых игр в которые я поиграл и впервые я поиграл в C&C 3 Tiberium Wars потом начал в Red alert играть и так далее потом вышла Ярость Кейна и мне ужасно понравилось новый вид бытвы добавили и всё такое жаль что компании за ГСБ не было но не суть. После всех частей пройденных мной а я прошел все игры серии C&C это нечто ужасное и скучное. Я даже проходить его не хотел, я просто хотел посмотреть концовку, я прошел 1 раз за Гди и 1 раз за Нод а остальные концовки посмотрел в инете. В общем не советую эту игру в ней нет ни постройки базы ни нормальных войск ни нормального геймплея как в предшествниках, действительно ""Зачем нужна эта построй базы это же так сложно"".

Je préfère même rejouer aux premiers de la série tant celui-ci propose un gameplay totalement aux antipodes des C&C comme on les aime !

Ce jeu est à éviter, je l'ai acheté dans le bundle en promo de C&C et très honnêtement je regrette sincèrement de l'avoir eu dedans, j'aurais préféré ne pas l'obtenir et passer à coté de cet étron tellement la désillusion est grande...

18年的CNC也是结束了，从小玩红警长大，对这个系列感情很深，将军2胎死腹中之后，CNC4注定是系列的终点了，还真的没想到最终作是这么个奇行种……（虽然我断断续续好几年才把战役通了）

首先来说这个游戏的成品质量：
　　剧情基本烂片，制作完全没有3代的水准；地图非常糊弄，程序相当偷懒（地形与单位碰撞检测无语得想砸键盘，各种单位空气墙），大家都能看出来这款“正统续作”根本就不算是亲生的，不论哪一方面都在透露着低成本赶工骗情怀的嘴脸。

再来具体谈谈这游戏的玩法设计：
　　本作对系列前作来说都是颠覆性的变革——简化建造部分，极度控制人口（不禁想到了某些RTS探路失败作）。这一设计也是有一些优点的，那就是再也没有人海战术和后期一波推的路线，从而迫使玩家更加关注策略。
　　但这种看似新颖的玩火设计显然非常不成熟。
　　1.三种基地的选择更像是为了设计而设计，并没有完全突出三选一能带来的优势特点。选择路线后反而固定了套路，发展缺乏多样化，也失去了随时根据战局调整的可控性（虽然可以重新选择路线，不过只能在出生点降落的设计很让人绝望）。
　　2.在建筑直接砍掉的前提下，为了弥补游戏元素过少的不足，设计了并不精简的大量冗余兵种。兵种虽多，但由于人口的限制，游戏可控单位数量极少，以至于每个单位的兵种血量逆天，再加上极端的兵种克制，1个步兵被5辆坦克群殴10秒不死有时还能反杀的情况也是时常发生，不禁怀疑数值策划是不是在报复社会……

步子迈得太大容易扯到胯……大家RTS都玩微创新，不是没有道理，20多年积累下来的模式不是能轻易改变的。创新可以有，但在正统续作上实验，只能说胆识过人，但有勇无谋吧；市场和口碑的双重滑铁卢足以说明这是一次完全失败的冒险。

最后：怀念西木头。

so was schelchtes hab ich schon lange nicht mehr gespielt, ansich is das gameplay ja ganz lustig, aber es kommt einfach nicht richtig motivation zusammen.
das die einheiten aufsteigen, ist ja ganz schön, jedach merkt man so gut wie nichts davon, das sie irgendwie stärker werden oder sonstige verbesserungen.
für mich ist allerdrings das schlimmste, das man von den crawlern(gebäude zu einheiten bau) jeweils nur einen bauen kann, sprich off, def und supp, dadruch auch andere einheiten bauen kann/muss, man könnte den crawler wechseln während des spieles, was aber schwachsinn ist weil nur off was bringt, dazu schwankt der schwierigkeitsgrad von missionen so sehr das man meint, man hat was falsch eingestellt.
für mich ist das spiel leider ne große enttäuschung und was mich zu diesem review veranlasst hat war eigentlich nur eine einheit die dermaßen geärgert hat, das mir der kragen geplatzt ist.
wie kann man denn nen trupp ins spiel einbauen, wohlgemerkt fußeinheit, die einfach deine panzer übernimmt obwohl fast 10 panzer auf ihn schießen und während er dir dann das teil klaut is er einfach nich down zu kriegen, so nimmt er sich stück für stück und du schießt eigene einheiten kaputt, ich flüchte doch nicht über die halbe karte mit panzern vor ""einer"" verdammten einheit, unfassbar.
wobei 10 panzer auch übertrieben is man kann ja nur 50-60 einheiten bauen und kein trup flug oder fahrzeug kostet weniger als 3 größere sogar 6, da kommt also nich viel zusammen zudem braucht man immer genügend rep einheiten.

First off this is not a sequal to an amazing game this is barley even command and conquer. There is no base building, no resource gathering, the community is dead, and this game is SO over priced its not even worth your time as a F2P game, and im one of the suckers that got tricked into buying it for 20 bucks, yeah i feel real stupid, please please please do not buy this game take that 20 dollars and buy one of the previous games in the series that is a true command and conquer game this is not CnC this is EAs attempt to squeeze as much money out of a game as they possibly can. And wtf is wrong with the Super dedicated Rock Paper Sissors style of units? it would be fine if they had COUNTER UNITS that could take on 2 diffrent types at once but there isn't its all just one unit ment to counter another no versatility and that breaks the game it means you just wasted alot of time building one type of unit to counter what you thought the enemy had only to realize he changed his army and before you say OH JUST BUILD A BUNCH OF DIFFRENT UNITS that won't work because you really do need an army of one type of unit to have any impact on the enemy, you could use that stratigy like i tried to but it simply fell apart and i was fighting bots at the time, the class system was interesting for 2 minutes till i found out aggressive support or campy defense is the best way to win. Here are my pros and cons

Pros (the few the proud)
Its a newer take on a stratigy game.

It adds new units to the game.

Works well enough with friends.

I had no lag issues and minimal game crashs.

Fast unistall.

Cons (here we go)
Nothing like any of the other CnC games so I simply can't label it as CnC.

There are no counter units meaning you just have to guess what the enemy is building and build units accordingly.

No base building and no resource gathering which is the corner stone of the CnC universe in terms of gameplay.

Some units are either broken op or so underwelming its just stupid (like the commandos that used to be badass).

Its way over priced.

Gameplay is increadably repetative.

Graphics are subpar to say the least.

The story is the weakest the CnC series has ever had.

If you do play with people its either a steam rolling support that focuses damage or rushing assault. 

There is no balancing in my opinion between the classes. 

No more fight the enemy to the death its now just who can get the most points by capturing points of intrest around the map ( the very limited amounts of maps).

Slow install.

Summary
EA once again found a series everyone loved and worrshipped and decided to destroy is for the sake of money the game is simply not fun its over priced its not CnC, I understand a game needs to evolve but you do need to keep those core elements in the game that make it that game something the devs don't understand and btw at this point in time the game is hacker central so if you do for some reason decide to buy this game have fun with that. 2/10 DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.","So I am a massive fan of the Command and conquer games and I heard about this game and simply had to try it, something i regret.

Nach vielen Jahren habe ich mir für 5 EUR dieses letzte Puzzlestück zu der tollen Tiberium-Reihe gekönnt, allen Unkenrufen zum Trotz... War ich seit Alarmstufe Rot völlig begeistert und habe seit den späten 90er Jahren alle C&C samt Addons regelmäßig gerne gespielt - sowohl die Missionen, als auch im Mehrspieler-Geplänkel.

RA 1 +2Addons - strategisch eines der besten
RA 2 +1Addon - das witzigste und einfachste zu ""Modden"" und mit FA2 zu ""mappen""
RA 3 +1Addon - hier schlägt es schon eine seltsame Richtung ein, allerdings gibt es eine super Mod, die Alarmstufe Rot 1 quasi auf die neue Engine portiert - top.
TD +1Addon - muss ich sagen, hat mich nie so begeistert, die Mechanik in RA war besser. Storytechnisch aber auch gut.
TS +1Addon - sowohl TiberianSun, als auch Firestorm sind meine absolute Favoriten, da strategisch mehr niemals mehr geboten wurde. Ver#nderbares Terrain, Untergrundeinheiten etc. Geiles Spiel - auch heute noch.
TW +1Addon - Meiner Meinung nach ist das der letzte Teil, der Tiberium-Saga, sowohl Storymäßig als auch grafisch und von der Mechanik. Die Dystopie aus TS/FS fehlt leider manchmal, aber dennoch ein sehr gutes Spiel.
Renegade und Generals lasse ich mal außen vor, da erstes ein FPS und zweites ein relativ realistisches gutes RTS-Game ist, aber mit CnC ebenfalls nicht wirklich etwas gemein hat.

=== Command & Conquer IV - Tiberian Twilight ===

Nach drei Stunden bereuhe ich den Kauf und möchte nicht mehr alles wiederholen, was bereits x Mal geschrieben wurde....

Kurzum:
Alles(!) was Command & Conquer ausgemacht hat, fehlt hier. Zwar wurde das seinerzeit zu Generals auch gesagt, doch Generals war ein echtes RTS - was man von TiberianTwilight nicht mal behaupten kann. Drei Produktionsstätten und irgendein mit XP-Punkten versehende Logik um Einheiten (begrenzt) bauen zu können. Wäre kein Joe C. ""Kane"" anwesend, in den wenigen Sequenzen, wüsste man nicht, dass man ein CnC in Händen hält.

Dämlich, nicht mal 5 EUR wert. Traurig, dass der gute Name von den Westwood Studios für dieses Machwerk missbraucht wurde. Wo CnC nun steht, wissen wir - im Regal bzw. als billiger Abklatsch als Free-To-Play-Variante...",

De todos os C&Cs que já lançaram e que eu já joguei esse é de longe o único que não tem nada haver com a franquia, alias não devia nem ter o titulo de C&C, o modo skirmish que era tão foda de ficar batalhando entre as A.I para tentar derrotar todas e controlar o mapa todo agora virou um modo estilo Conquest, não tem coleta de recurso igual seus antecessores, o sistema de upgrade é uma Me#$% foge completamente do contesto de um jogo RTS na qual somente upando de level que você consegue liberar tropas e tecnologias, você pode escolher entre 3 classes(defense, support e offense) para jogar e com diferentes unidades cada classe, necessário estar online sempre e caso a conexão cair você perde todo o progesso, fico triste ao saber que uma franquia tão memorável como C&C acabou tomando o rumo errado e teve esse fim completamente decepcionante .

Essa é minha opinião, fique livre para criticar e opinar.

Cons: 
1. No base building/ tiberium harvesting= loss of the rts feel. What I mean by this is that 4 is more for the starcraft spam multiplayer than anyone else. Without base building or real tiberium harvesting where every purchase is much more impacting in the long meta of a mission, everything here becomes a rock paper scissors contest of what you can deploy to counter 1 to 2 enemy crawlers. Without base building the story also seems totally rushed.
2. The story is terrible. Either way you end up really lossing and with the worst cliff hanger that implies EA not progressing the story past this game. Its like we began with Turtledove, rich in universe detail and description with Tiberium Dawn thru tiberium sun while forgoing character development. then in 3 we hit an SM Stirling kind of narrative with really indepth background about the universe, annecdotes about characters like Havoc from Renegade, and crazy battlefields like red zones and yellow. Then we hit this...this slop. If you are here for the story I suggest you find it elsewhere for Tiberium Twilight will make you hate yourself. 
3. Multiplayer is stupid unbalanced due to unit unlocks versus experience.

Premièrement, les unités ne vienne pas de la même façon que les autres opus. Dans cette merde, vous devez montez votre niveau global du jeu pour avoir les meilleurs unités et améliorations d'unités. Donc si vous êtes nouveau à ce jeu et que vous jouez en ligne contre un joueur niveau max, vous allez en chier une bonne. En plus, votre niveau ''global'' n'est pas vraiment global, car votre lvl augmente seulement dans la faction dont vous jouez. C'est à dire que si vous jouez avec le GDI, le Nod va rester à son niveau actuel. 

Deuxièmement, vous n'avez QU'UNE SEULE structure. Vous ne pouvez pas construire par exemple des centrales pour votre énergie parce que vous en avez pas besoin. Les seules structure qu'on peut fabriquer sont les tourelles et autres défenses. Autrement dit, tout ce fait avec votre unique base (appelé Crawler) : création d'unité, amélioration, etc... et sérieusement, je trouve cela vraiment médiocre.

Finalement, le truc qu'on a tous besoin dans tous les RTS est bien sûr la gestion des ressources. Dans ce jeu, il n'y en a pas. Le tiberium, seule ressource du jeu, n'existe plus. D'accord j'avoue qu'il en a encore dans le jeux, mais ça sert seulement à faire avancé vos amélioration plus rapidement. les parties ressemblent plus à du spam de création d'unité. La stratégie n'existe plus dans C&C 4.

Pour conclure, ce jeu est mauvais. Il y a d'autre chose que je n'ai pas parlé comme la sorte de classe que vous pouvez prendre: attaque, défense et soutien. Je trouve cette idée vraiment nulle, parce que vous n'avez pas toutes les variations d'unité (exemple : pour avoir des unités aériennes il faut être soutien). Franchement, j'avais acheté cet opus seulement pour connaître le reste de l'histoire, mais j'ai pas réussi à le finir à cause du gameplay pourri qui me dégoûte. Même en rabais je le déconseille.

 - Sometimes it's very challenging.
 - Visuals.
 - 5v5 players possible.

Reasons to avoid it and tell me that i am stupid for giving it a positive rating :

 - Abysmal plot written by a madman in a few hours. Probably taken from DeviantArt fanfiction section.
 - Questionable units design.
 - Horrible FMV actors performance.
 - There is almost no way to beat campaign alone, it's designed to be beaten in COOP.
 - Unit cap.
 - Has almost nothing to do with C&C, hence no base building or tiberium harvesting.
 - The ending cutscene ( which is the finale of whole C&C series presumably ) is so horrible that you might want to kys after it.
 - Most of the super/special weapons feel weak.
 - You need to unlock units in order to use them.


If reasons to avoid it don't scare you + it's on a huge sale and you have a friend to play it with - then you might want to get it just for collection and full playthrough with people you know. If you're looking for extra content for it - don't. Game doesn't have mod support, but it does have few custom maps.

But if you want some more good old C&C - don't get it, it's not C&C, it won't be fun for you, infact it might leave you with few dead brain cells, just like me.","This is not your typical C&C by any means, the rumors say that this was EA's attempt to push C&C to eSports, but because market was overwhelmed by MOBAs and other quality RTS games, they decided to slap 4 and ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE story on it to lure in loyal C&C fans, and the final product we have now does look and play exactly like it was initially planned to be. The only reason i give this game a positive rating is because i had a tons of fun and positive memories playing it with my friends in coop/compstomp and just skirmish with AI. If you play this game without thinking about past C&C games, it's actually fine, runs great, plays great, looks great. Let's do a breakdown :

The UI is a thing of nightmares and so full of glitches, you'd need Yuri Prime's psychic ability to directly access the developers mind on how it works.
The game perspective is so near, with a zoom so limited, that you can only go from viewing nasal hair, out to the blackheads covering the nose of a particularly grubby Zone-trooper.
Not that viewing the game is necessary as only being able to produce a handful of units, buildings, etc. due to the tiny resource caps, that you may as well keep the mouse button constantly clicking to make new units as the old ones get destroyed as soon as they emerge.
As for unit capabilities, you can go from nerf to fluffy kitten in a single bound, rendering the entire enterprise as challenging as going for a poo having eaten six buckets of yogurt.
Not that you should bother playing the game at all, as the concept of game-play seems to have eluded the developers who must have been so high on LSD they thought a table leg was interesting.
Thinking on it, I'm embarrassed for the video actors, some of who were in previous C&C incarnations and acted their hearts out in this one, only for it to be a total disgrace.

Suport - Units, mostly repair/heal. some attack. Powers - repair, clocking and stuff (global)

Плюсы:

Завершение истории не смотря на кучу оставшихся вопросов

Наличие мозга не обязательно

Лысина Кейна

Панацея от игровой зависимости

Незабываемый опыт  - ДА игра действительна вызывает эмоции. Боль, гнев, чувство бесконечного осознания собственной ничтожности и важности твоего мнения как потребителя для злобных корпораций. Всю прелесть космических путешествий,изучения и познания нашей вселенной на личном транспортном средстве - горящая жо""па. Действительно не то что ты мог ожидать от развлекательной продукции, но хей по крайней мере это не бездушный трипл А а игра дарящая эмоции. 

Что бы зайти в игру нужно конкретно потрудится с регистрациями итд итп в случае переустановки еще и проблема с повторной активацией продукта казалось огромный минус и не удобство НО я верю что компания ЕА заботится о вашем здоровье и всячески усложняет вам доступ к этому продукту потому записываю в плюс

Возможность скипнуть заставку ЕА

Минусы:

Не игра - ЭТО прошло контроль качества кампании EA что очень пугает меня даже спустя 5 лет

Нет экономики - да во многих играх ее нет но там хоть есть игра

Краулеры - Есть 3 вида атакующий и 2 бесполезных

Разделение шагалок - кроме бесполезности всего кроме атакующего нет возможности комбинировать войска каждая шагалка рожает только один род войск тоесть по факту у вас даже не передвижная база а ТОЛЬКО военный завод\казарма\аэродром

Армия - Лимит юнитов смехотворен и странное чувство что в 95 я мог построить больше юнитов чем в 2010 не давало покоя.

Геймплей - вся игра сводится к тому что нужно дойти до места и родить юнитов, в случае если задача уничтожить врага нужно сесть своей хреновиной рядом с вражеской и смотреть как две херовины рожают юнитов в жалких попытках уничтожить друг друга

Динамичность - поймите меня правильно смотреть как два юнита стреляют друг в друга по 2 минуты не то что бы увлекательное действие 

Вторичность - в каждой серии игры так или иначе был виден технологический прогресс человечества за время нашего отсутствия но видимо в ЕА решили что ""нет игры - нет прогресса"" и юниты не то что бы изменились с момента 3 части большенство из них стали даже хуже. Видимо с момента последней войны все малость подзабили на тех обслуживание или типа того) нет конечно же некоторые юниты кочуют по играм серии с первой части но даже в них чувствуется развитие технологий. Тут нам предлогают все тоже самое + штучную пехоту( что на мой взгляд конкретный шаг назад на фоне 3 части)
Так же и замут с протоганистом искуственным интелектом как то в этот раз не зашел.
А глядя на полоски захвата стратегических пунктов упорно пытаешься найти значки Альянса и Орды
Однообразные задачи на протяжении всей игры которые прекрасно дополняют однообразный геймплей

Дегродация качества  - У нас в 3 части был в полне приличный перевод даже названия GDI(ГСБ)Глобальный Совет Безопасности и вообще качество работы Актеров озвучки на весьма приличном уровне. Актерам озвучки видимо давали сначало демо версию игры ибо желания работать (а может быть даже и жить) в их творчестве не чувствуется. В этой  поделке видимо даже локализаторы прошли контроль качества EA(Вместе со сценаристами, и тем человеком который решил отказатсья от основ C&C и переработать из стратегии в говно И мужик который накурил всех паленым красным тиберием...и секретарша которая не дала босу и он решил отомстить человечеству создав ЭТО в волнующем приходе от красного) - ибо только им одним ведомо как то же самое GDI(ГДИ) расшифровать адекватному русскоязычному человеку. Выдать говно за игру. Раскрутить ее так что люди это купят. И впервые в жизни не соврать с названием - это действительно закат....

Знаком с предыдущими продуктами серии - без коментариев просто плачу о покинувшей нас серии 

Стоимость - они хотят денег за то что убили великую RTS  и в итоге превратили ее в ср""ную браузерку

[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/24810]Command & Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath Review[/url]

[h1]INTRODUCTION:[/h1]
Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight is a real-time strategy game developed and published by Electronic Arts. This title serves as the official sequel to the critically acclaimed C&C 3: Tiberium Wars  and acts as the final chapter in the decade and a half long Command & Conquer Tiberian franchise.

[h1]PLOT (No Spoilers):[/h1]
The story picks up 15 years after the end of Command & Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath. The Scrin has been defeated, Kane has successfully recovered the Tacitus and the Brotherhood of NOD is merely a shadow of its former self. Despite the Scrin's failed invasion, all is not well as Tiberium now spreads in an ever more rapid rate and human extinction is almost inevitable. The game starts with Kane offering the remaining world leaders a solution to this problem.

[h1]PROS:[/h1]
+ Return of live action cinematics but...(See CON #1)
+ Good sound effects and voice acting
+ Interesting veterancy system with visual upgrade changes for each level of veterancy
+ Good special effects and graphics (but average art style)
+ Interesting new units

[h1]CONS:[/h1]
- [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=522954423]Poor costume quality for the live action cutscenes[/url]
- No base building
- No resource gathering
- DRM Stacking (Always Online + Log-in requirement every time you start the game)
- Unlock and account level up system that ruins the game's unit availability: (meaning you can't jump to multiplayer immediately because half of your units are locked.)
- Population Cap
- The game is lore deficient, with a rushed and confusing story
- Poorly written and poorly executed attempt to establish “emotional depth” by giving the Commander a wife that most players won't care about.
- Lack of mission variety and the fun stealth missions were completely removed
- No side bar like the old games; the entire UI looks bad as a whole
- Too much deviation from the C&C source material meaning it neither look nor feel like a C&C game
- Ridiculously low damage and high HP for every unit that results in...(See next CON)
- VERY slow paced action
- Pathfinding problems
- Severe balance issues
- Very short campaign time
- Small and poorly designed campaign maps
- The game as a whole feels rushed and cheap

[h1]NEUTRAL:[/h1]
+/- The 'Crawler / MCV' unit building system is an interesting idea but it shouldn't have been implemented on an already existing franchise such as C&C because it already has an established (and working) formula.

[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]
A [b]VERY BAD[/b] sequel which stands as an insult to the fans of a 15 year old franchise. In EA's attempt to “innovate,” they failed to see what made the Command and Conquer games fun for a lot of people.

[h1]WORTH IT?[/h1]
[b]NO,[/b] the game is not worth it. I would [b]not recommend[/b] this game to anyone even on a sale, specially if you're a fan of the old games. You're better off buying the previous titles like [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/24790/]Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars[/url] and its [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/24810/]expansion[/url].

[h1]FINAL NOTES:[/h1]
I would have been kinder in my criticism of this game if it did not have the Command and Conquer name on it. Tiberian Twilight would have sold better and would have been received better by the community if it was merely a spin-off rather than the finale of the franchise.

[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/24810]Command & Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath Review[/url]

[h1]INTRODUCTION:[/h1]
Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight is a real-time strategy game developed and published by Electronic Arts. This title serves as the official sequel to the critically acclaimed C&C 3: Tiberium Wars  and acts as the final chapter in the decade and a half long Command & Conquer Tiberian franchise.

[h1]PLOT (No Spoilers):[/h1]
The story picks up 15 years after the end of Command & Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath. The Scrin has been defeated, Kane has successfully recovered the Tacitus and the Brotherhood of NOD is merely a shadow of its former self. Despite the Scrin's failed invasion, all is not well as Tiberium now spreads in an ever more rapid rate and human extinction is almost inevitable. The game starts with Kane offering the remaining world leaders a solution to this problem.

[h1]PROS:[/h1]
+ Return of live action cinematics but...(See CON #1)
+ Good sound effects and voice acting
+ Interesting veterancy system with visual upgrade changes for each level of veterancy
+ Good special effects and graphics (but average art style)
+ Interesting new units

[h1]CONS:[/h1]
- [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=522954423]Poor costume quality for the live action cutscenes[/url]
- No base building
- No resource gathering
- DRM Stacking (Always Online + Log-in requirement every time you start the game)
- Unlock and account level up system that ruins the game's unit availability: (meaning you can't jump to multiplayer immediately because half of your units are locked.)
- Population Cap
- The game is lore deficient, with a rushed and confusing story
- Poorly written and poorly executed attempt to establish “emotional depth” by giving the Commander a wife that most players won't care about.
- Lack of mission variety and the fun stealth missions were completely removed
- No side bar like the old games; the entire UI looks bad as a whole
- Too much deviation from the C&C source material meaning it neither look nor feel like a C&C game
- Ridiculously low damage and high HP for every unit that results in...(See next CON)
- VERY slow paced action

Je ne suis pas un grand joueur de STR, je joue plus pour le fun que pour la compétition, je n'ai pas joué aux autres Command and conquer, mais je connais les personnages et 
les factions.

[b] Le jeu:[/b]

C'est un STR, avec une toute nouvelle forme de gameplay qui a déplu à la majorité de la communauté, les Crawlers.
Des machines mobiles servant de QG, elle permet de générer différentes unités, de gérer des améliorations, et des constructions pour les crawlers défensifs.
Donc plus de bâtiment, (sauf pour le crawler défensif).

La gameplay est assez simpliste, chaque unité à une unité de faiblesse qui est indiqué sur sa petite ""fiche de présentation"" en jeu, avec les hp.

Cependant, malgrès que j'apprécie ce jeu, il à beaucoup de mauvais aspect de mon point de vue pour le gameplay:

-La récupération de tibérium, affreusement DURE, qui encourage les joueurs à build des petites unité à bas coup et rapide pour aller embêter les autres joueurs dans
cette récupération, essentielle pour la late game. Systéme de récupération qui a d'ailleurs aussi changé par rapport aux autres Command and Conquer.

-Systéme de snowball trop présent, un mauvais coup et pour remonter bonne chance.

-Trop peu d'unité total sur le terrain à mon goût, 4 juges même pas tous remplies de Devot.

Les mécaniques ont beaucoup changé par rapport aux autres Command and Conquer, cependant j'apprécie les cinématiques, la bande son, les voix en Français, les personnages.

Peut-être que je suis resté bloqué sur ça, que pour moi le seul fait de voir des personnages que j'apprécie dans un jeu qu'il soit bon ou mauvais me suffit à l'apprécier.

J'ai une bonne expérience sur ce jeu auquel j'ai joué un moment avec un ami, l'univers m'a plu, mais je comprends tout à fait qu'il n'ait pas satisfait les anciens joueurs de 
Command and Conquer, étant moi même très sceptique aux changements.

It's magical to see EA ruin yet another game which came, as I said, from a brutal saga in which I enjoyed all the other titles. GJ EA and keep up the good work, not gonna buy any game with your signature on it!

P.S. Windows 8.1 users have fun setting up the game with the graphic settings, took me around 20 minutes for it since it crashed all the time while changing settings (which was less than adequate with options). Oh and I do run GTA V and Witcher 3 on max graphics so my PC isn't an issue for this bit."

I'll start with a positive though I did like the asthetic, It wasn't half bad, The nod didn't look quite how I'd expect them to but overall it was okay. However that is the only positive I have about the game and not a very strong one at that, now for the negatives.

Lets start with the most glaringly obvious one which i think everyone feels the same and that's the campaign... This had to be written by some emotionless, imbecilic monkey. It literally starts off going THIS NAMELESS CHARACTER IS YOUR WIFE CARE ABOUT HER!!!! (uhhh okay???) Okay seriously why would I care about this character, I've literally never seen them before but the game just expects you to care about her and really really obnoxiously tries shove it down your throat it's insane because aboviously they're going to use her as a plot device. I think a bloody 5 year old can figure that out.
The campaign is insanely short as well I completed the whole thing in about 2.5 hours, that's it... the whole thing.. and like an hour of it is a tutorial. It ends so suddenly as well I was like wait is that it. I just did like 4 missions after the tutorial crap and then poof, done, over. I can only imagine that they were planning on bringing out a tonne of garbage DLC for this just to unlock more campaign missions.

Now for the Gameplay... 
It's terrible just flat out terrible, it's watered down from other games and lacks any sort of depth or strategy.
This is literally it it, You start off with your main ""structure"" called a Crawler, now you move your crawler to whatever objective you have which is either one of 3 things: Capture thing, kill thing or Defend thing. (defending thing being the most annoying since you have no control over said thing it will generally just run into things and get itself killed, it's like ""Hay you know what would be a fun idea, lets walk face first into that big horde of enemies over there. I'm sure things will be completely fine!""). Now as I was saying here's what the gameplay is: Move Crawler to objective, Deploy Crawler, Throw shit at problem until it goes away, move to next objective. That's it, that's all I did, I didn't have to care about what units I built since all i had to do is build the spider tanks with the big ass tesla coil and throw them at the enemy, I didn't even have to worry about them dying since if you build like 3 or 4 engineers everything you have is pretty much immortal anyway. i didn't even have to worry about my base since there's no base building to worry about and the base came with me anyway so screw defenses. Oh and for tech it's literally hay see that red crystal over there? yeah pic that up like 1 or 2 of them and you can INSTANTLY unlock every single bit of tech you want.

So that's it that's C&C 4 in all it's terribleness. The only way I could possibly recommend this game is to play it just to see how bad it is.","Okay so i have been a fan of C&C for about 20 years now and I can safely say this is THE most disapointing title I have ever played.

Taktik - brauchst du keine, man muss nur darauf achten das immer einheiten gebaut werden.
Grafik - war schon viel besser (achtung, Augenkrebsgefahr :-/ ).
Musik - die musik ist einfach eine endlosschleife die gefühlt 10 sekunden sich zu wiederholen scheint.
Sounds - war schon viel besser
Interface - viele Schaltflächen die man erst benutzen darf wenn man weiter ist.
Die Einheiten - Quantität statt Qualität so sieht ein futuristischer Krieg sicher nicht aus (nicht vergessen 50 Einheiten limit, 5 Panzer und schluss). Meiner meinung viel zu viele verschiedene Typen die alle irgendwie nix drauf haben. Übergroße mega Kanonen haben sie alle die minmal schaden machen (soll das witzig sein?)
Baubare Gebäude - gibt es eigentlich keine.
Gameplay - Einheiten bauen bauen bauen bauen bauen bauen bauen und das beste sie kosten nicht mal was weil sowas wie einen Sammler braucht man nicht weil es gar nix zu sammeln gibt!

Die Story war auch ganz witzig, das Technoflair stimmig, und alles in allem ein wirklich hübsches Spiel.

Tja, jetzt war Teil 4 im Sale, und ich dachte mir, schau Dir mal an, wie C&C heute so in modern aussieht. Aber gleich vorweg - was auch immer EA aus C&C gemacht hat, es ist nicht mehr C&C...

Es gibt ein Einheitenlimit, und man kann keine Basis/Gebäude bauen - man platziert einfach sein MBF irgendwo auf einer vordefinierten Fläche, gibt ihm eine von drei taktischen Ausrichtungen (offensiv/defensiv/Unterstützung), und spamt dann nur noch Einheiten. Eine richtig schöne Masse wie bei den alten Teilen kommt dank des strengen Einheitenlimits aber trotzdem nicht zusammen, und so wird einem das Leben künstlich schwer gemacht. Taktikverständnis wird im Prinzip nicht gebraucht, es ist mehr wie ein modernes Clickergame.

Ich hatte gelesen, dass die Kampagne sehr kurz sein soll (es sind wohl 2x7 Missionen), und dachte noch, das halte ich durch. Habe jetzt bei Mission 5 aufgehört und werde stattdessen eine Wand streichen gehen. Der Farbe beim Trocknen zuzusehen macht nämlich viel mehr Spaß als C&C 4...

……玩过大概20H,明白为什么叫它WTF了，怒删都难以发泄我现在的心情。.蛋疼的人口和等级设定,本来就不想玩久只想速通战役还要在遭遇战上花几个小时刷等级。ai上NOD支援只会出眼镜蛇，对上GDI支援就算是凶残打简单也是被吊打。还有就是万年不变的网络链接问题，连不上服务器意味着游戏也玩不了，好歹你设一个离线模式不行么。最后我想吐槽剧情，朋友说4代剧情渣得要死，个人感觉剧情主线还可以，但就是糟糕的叙事硬-生-生把一个本来至少可称优秀的剧情给毁-掉-了。其他要吐槽的地方我都记不清了。只想说一句——把我的C&C还给我！
      最后客观说一句，这游戏概念和质量其实还是不错的，错就错在他的名字是C&C。要是你喜欢魔兽什么的微操，或者说今年那个灰蛊的小规模战斗，那么这游戏还是适合你。但如果你是因为它是C&C而来，恐怕你要失望了，不建议入，否则会颠覆你的世界观的。当然你说信仰喜+1什么的我也阻止不了你，就像我当时瞎了眼没有管下面一大波红色评价并阻止自己剁手一样。",

Yes, EA do what they typically do and use a name to sell a game that's completely different from what is expected of it. It probably should have been an offshoot instead of a sequel. If you can ignore that then it's not that bad of a game and has no serious technical problems.

The game is basically just dumbed down and casualised RTS that's good for playing for 30 minutes. All the more complex aspects such as base and resource management are thrown away leaving you with the job of looking after 1 master unit, the Crawler. You collect Tiberium crystals to receive upgrade points and when the Crawler is destroyed it respawns at a drop off point. The Defense type can construct buildings but only buildings such as the Obelisk and Nuke/Ion Cannon which require the Crawler to be alive to operate. Support buildings can also be captured but cannot be destroyed.

I completed the campaign and played some skirmishes. The skirmish mode is a little shallow and some extra customization would have made it much better such as increasing the unit limit for games with more players. I'm going to give it a thumbs up for that at least. If you want or expect a traditional C&C experience then don't get it and stick to C&C 3 or the older games.","I actually quite enjoyed playing this despite the bad publicity it has.

- Permanent online connection require to play. In the middle of the campaign EA servers went down and now i simply can't play until they decide to go back up. Now i am here, angry, writing a review.

- Requires you to login and input your password every time you start the game.

- Unskippable cutscenes

- Lack of mission variety, is most of the time build troops and walk around the map destroying everything in empty skirmishers style maps. Is really hard to believe that this game was released in the same year that Starcraft 2 came out.

- The new mechanics are really average, there is not much do to. They cut out resource collection, all you do is choose the appropriate MCV to the situation and walk with your troops.

- Units are ultra resilient. It may take minutes of firing to kill an enemy armada. Combat is not fun.

Westwood Studios gave birth to a new kind of gameplay called Real Time Strategy with a game whose name became legendary: Command & Conquer. The war in real time with boobs and rock music. God that was good. That... WAS... Q_Q

Came EA who made this shitty robbery called C&C4. Watched without comparison it may be an interesting game... BUT I can't watch it without comparison because of its name: COMMAND & CONQUER.

EA killed Command & Conquer and give the corpse to be raped by anyone who is clumsy enough to hope the final chapter the C&C franchise deserved.

14583167,spanish,2015.01.22 01:11,❌,✅,0.9213665724,241,"En el 2012, me acuerdo cuando en el blog de una cosplayer de España había debatído sobre el final de Mass Effect 3, el cual le parecía injusto que el final decepcionara tanto. Yo le había respondido ""Si eso es lo único que te ha decepcionado de EA, es porque no has visto el final de Command & Conquer 4. Eso SI que es una verdadera decepcion"". Si despues de eso, no ha jugado a esto, espero haberle hecho de alguna forma un favor invirtiendo su tiempo mejor en otra cosa mas interesante, como mirar un muro, por ejemplo xD.

Lo que voy a contar lo digo desde el punto de vista de fan de la saga. Aquella franquicia que me hizo fan de PC por excelencia (mucho antes de Starcraft, Max Payne, KotOR, Medal of Honor, etc) fue, sin duda, Command & Conquer (C&C), mas o menos la 1era instancia para MS-DOS allá por el 1995. Asi que me voy a tomar un tiempo en explicar el drama que aqueja a semejante monstruo que es esto.

Durante la franquicia, su antigua desarrolladora (Westwood Studios, el cual a fines de 1999 fue absorvida por EA) había generado 2 lineas temporales: la 1era basada en la guerra fria entre las potencias occidentales Vs. La Unión Sovietica (URSS) y la 2da en la que se basaba originariamente C&C:  El universo de Tiberium.

 Para hacerlo breve: en la decada del 90 en Europa del Este cae un meteorito con un mineral verde llamado Tiberium el cual empieza a esparcirse por todo el continente, y que consume los recursos y minerales de la Tierra, no obstante, su letalidad con todo ente biótico con que entre en contacto tambien es consumido por el cristal, lo que genera una amenaza grave para la sociedad mundial. Es entonces cuando surge del anonimato una sociedad secreta que adoraba al cristal, conocido como la Hermandad de Nod, liderada por un sujeto megalómano conocido como Kane (el cual se lo considera el mesias, había predicado la nueva era de tiberium para la humanidad, etc. No muere realmente en casi ningun juego). la ONU, para contrarestar a esta organización de que asimilen para ellos solos el cristal, genera una división militar internacional contra el terrorismo conocido como la GDI o Global Defense Initiative. Posterior a esto, entre estas facciónes se generan 3 guerras mundiales (que vendrían a hacer cada C&C de Tiberium) en el que la cantidad de muertos se cuentan por millones, mientras el tiberium casi consume todo el planeta, destruyendo ecosistemas y extinguiendo al ser humano a la par de los conflictos bélicos.

Y es aquí en el que entra la descripcion de este juego. en el 2062, casi 15 años despues de Tiberium Wars. El mundo esta casi totalmente devastado por tiberium, y la extinción de la especie humana es casi inminente... pero un día Kane, se levanta de su siesta, escuchando Joan Manuel Serrat al canto de ""Hoy puede ser un gran día"", va  a hacer una visita a los directivos de la GDI y les plantea un plan para salvar al mundo del cristal verde y que sean todos hippies, y así salvar la humanidad....

... tiene sentido? por supuesto que no. Pero bueno, sacando el sarcasmo, esto es lo que pasó realmente en este juego. Aparentemente un lider como Kane, el cual declaró la guerra a GDI, y fue participe de genocidios masivos, como hacer desaparecer casi toda europa con una bomba de tiberio liquido, de repente quiere aliarse contra sus peores enemigos con los cuales hizo guerras durante 80 años, para reparar el mundo (¿?) cuando él mismo quería que el planeta sea consumida por él....
Si no tiene sentido, está el guionista del juego, un tal Sam Bass, que se merece una patada en el trasero por esto. Supuestamente ESTE iba a ser el ULTIMO juego del universo de Tiberium... y así lo dejó.

 Que desastre... y otros se quejaban del final de Mass Effect 3...

Ok, con respecto al juego, que tenga el titulo de C&C no implica que se sienta como uno. Este juego es el intento de EA de hacer novedad en la franquicia, generando un MOBA, pero destruye lo que hizo clásico al C&C, poniendo limite de población, y sacando la construcción de bases, y NO HAY TIBERIUM (hay algun cristalito por allí en los mapas para mejorar poderes, pero no hay lo mas importante del juego!) por ende, no hay recolección de recursos. La idea es hacer un edificio móvil (Crawler) que permite la construcción de unidades de forma inmediata. Las conquistas de los mapas, se tratan de capturar diversos puntos estrategicos hasta que se alcance el limite de puntos, en multiplayer. Aunque llevado a la práctica, el juego es divertido y los mapas estan bien realizados a la par de que los combates no se detienen por nada, aquí no hay casi referencia a nada de command & conquer que lo hiciera famoso. Además para aquellos que se hayan comprado el juego, 1ero tienen que jugar la campaña para luego entrar al multiplayer, porque tiene un sistema de progresión de arsenal que se comparte tanto en single como en multi, por ende muchos se aprobechaban de esto y destrozaban a noobs por este tema. A pesar de esto, reconozco que el gameplay es bastante entretenido y divertido, pero se siente muy parecido a un Dawn of War 2, versión 2.1 en lugar de que se sienta como un C&C

Para aquel que sea casual, este juego le va a resultar interesante, porque su gameplay es frenético y las unidades son bien variadas, pero para el fan hardcore, sabiendo que este sería el final de 15 años de C&C, esto es un disparo a quemarropa al corazón (EA no piensa volver a este universo, solo utiliza un juego de Facebook horrendo en su lugar), así de simple ... al menos que seas capaz de dejar eso de lado y disfrutar el juego simplemente por lo que es y pensar de que  la historia de Kane pudo haber concluido mejor de lo que tristemente fue.",

Ок. Не подхожу. Игра - шлак. Игра в жанре, на секундочку, стратегии, в которой стратегия редуцирована до таскания краулера за войсками по полю боя, а тактика - к определению по принципу ""камень-ножницы-бумага"" нужного рода войск для текущей ситуации и накликиванию их необходимого количества в панели заказов.
Отстройка базы? Добыча ресурсов? Планирование развития? О чём вы - всего этого больше нет.

Что осталось на том же уровне - это сюжет и видеовставки. Первый логично завершает историю (хотя, сколько раз уже казалось, что она завершена), а вторые - традиционно отыгрывают это событие с выдающимся пафосом и мастерством актёра театра самодеятельности химкомбината. Разумеется, это нисколько ни умаляет игру, поскольку является её, своего рода, визитной карточкой. Умаляет её то, что чтобы получить ""тот самый"" сюжет на ""тех самых"" роликах приходится продираться через уже помянутый всуе чудовищный геймплей.

Что в итоге? В итоге ничего. Игры нет. Остался какой-то обрубок расчитанный на некую абстрактную ""новую аудиторию"", которая должна, внезапно, появиться в старом сеттинге.

I've have been a C&C fan since I was 4, aka from 1998. The first game was perhaps the first game I have ever got and was the series that got me into both gaming and real time strategy games. So as you can see, when I heard abotu C&C 4, I was prepared to enbark on a good bye party for my beloved franchise. However, I had to scrap it when a leaked beta information on the gameplay changes the game was gonna make. Therefore I avoided the game like the plague. Once the game was finally released, did I feel guilty of having to abandon the party?
Apparently not cause not only did the reviews show little discouragement but 98% of all the C&C fans like me cryout in anger for the series. Obviously this game recommendation from me was Hell no (and I'll repeat it again at the end for those who are too lazy to read this and skips to the end. 
So why is the game bad? Well the first problem is the gameplay. The gameplay in terms of C&C gameplay felt like it was design by satan. Rather than traditional gameplay where you would collect resources and build both a base and an army to conquer your enemies, the game went Moba like based game with a unusual population limit (which drew me away from the game) and a requirement of playing from other people. Another thing that the game is known to have been hated on is the story. Now I haven't played the campaign but from what I heard, it's a cluster f*(k. 
So is there one thing I like about the game? well......... I do actually enjoy the music which is actually pretty good.
In conclusion, if it wasn't for C&C being in the game, it could have been ok, but the C&C is a perminate damage to the game for I have to say I do not recommend the game

It is to be said that this game and its dynamics, even the approach to it all, differ fundementally from the previous installment. The game is rather based on having mobile bases, not only encouraging of establishing only temporary bases, but even forcing you to hastly settle down only to for the most urgent actions and to move on in a giant caravan of units and your mobile command/construction building in order to survive. In the sense that [spoilers!] the planet is a Tiberian wasteland invaded by an Alien species in this installment, it gives off this nomadic post-apocalyptic feeling, which might be quite matching but hurt the gameplay experience in my opinion. Everything feels less permanent, rather like an action-packed campaign mission where your goal is not to build up a base and start offensives from there, but to utilize the little you have to outsmart your (in this case, also) mobile enemy.

Before I start the criticism of the game, I feel that it would be fair to mention the one redeeming feature because there is only one and that is Joe Kucan reprising his role as Kane, about the only thing satisfying for a long time fan of the series such as myself.  Now on to the downsides.

1. The complete lack of base building and resource gathering.  How you can even label this game as an RTS without these core elements is beyond me, instead of the staples of the RTS genre, units cost a certain amount of ""Command Points"" and that's it.  No tiberium, nothing to be gathered or collected or used tactically, just a limit placed on you at the start of the game and boom click a button, create units up to the limit and that's it, that's the extent of resources in the game.  And as for base building, much the same applies, you have a power limit so you place down a certain number of defensive turrets up to the limit and that's really all there is to it - on both fronts a complete lack of anything in-depth, evidence of a second rate game aimed at a minor market being shoe-horned into something much bigger than it actually is intended to be.

2. The units/maps/graphics.  The units provided at the start of the game are weak and ineffectual so in order to obtain more units you level up and then unlock them which sounds like a fairly simple concept, that is until you realise that exp. for leveling up is difficult to come by.  The lack of exp. becomes apparent after still not being awarded any after completion of the third mission in the story meaning that in order to progress your tech, hours of play time is required to unlock even just mostly mid-range units.  The weakness of initial units isn't alleviated by the fact that you can make large numbers as the Command Point limit applies so you are restricted to small squads of units, not the massive armies you expect from an RTS game.  To go with the theme of a small number of units, the maps which battles are conducted on are best summed up as tiny, cramped arenas with very little room for manouvere meaning it's goodbye to any tactical thinking and hello to comabt which feels scripted and unintelligent.  As if the unit/map situation was not already bad enough, this steaming mass of disappointment is served up in a graphical style more akin to a comic book setting, gone is the sleek, futuristic, powerful look of C&C3, it is instead replaced by  out of place, chunky, Megablocks style units, which completly destroys any sort of serious mood the game intends to create.  The graphical style of C&C4's units is so far removed from C&C3's that they're not even in the same universe, nevermind the same page.

3. The story.  It's fairly obvious that the story is terrible from pretty much the word go as one of the first scenes has you, as commander, greeted by your wife.  Yep, that's right, your wife because that's just what an RTS story needs, a bullshit love interest forced into the game.  From then on the story goes rapidly downhill, not aided by the dire acting of all those involved (with the exception of Joe Kucan) and then ends with the equivalent of ""And they all rode off into the sunset and lived happily ever after.""  Seriously? After having fought now at this time 4 Tiberium Wars, having battled across the globe and faced all manner of foes whilst still wondering about the mystery of Nod and Kane and what the ultimate goal could be, it ends with ""Kane and all of Nod travel through the alien tower and leave GDI behind on a tiberium-free Earth having left them peacefully"".  I have to wonder what it is with EA and their amazing ability to consistently screw up epic storylines and disappoint faithful fans of a beloved genre because that ending is just utter horseshit and reeks of a rushed writing crew being forced to pull something out of their asses.

So to conclude, C&C4 fails to deliver on all fronts: from dreadful mechanics and weak units, to poor acting and a storyline that could arugably have been concieved by a 5 year old, C&C4 smacks of poor quality, despiration and coporate greed.  A truly disappointing end to a great series, something that should not have come to pass.  I cannot urge you strongly enough, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!

Oh and one last thing... EA please if you would kindly go fuck yourselves bloody with a rusty sword that would be greatly appreiciated, you cunts.","It is not often that I am disappointed and depressed by a video game but unfortunately C&C4 has got to be one of the most awful games I have ever had the misfortune to have played.

Sowohl Menüführung als auch Ingamesteuerung sind sehr gewöhnungsbedürftig, eher unübersichtlich(ich hab zuviele RTS gespielt als das ich mit Steuerungen nicht zurecht käme)

Seit heute werde ich wahrscheinlich jeden weiteren C&C Teil meiden.

Electronic Arts’ award-winning and best-selling Tiberium saga is coming to a powerful conclusion with Command & Conquer 4, which will introduce a multitude of innovations to the classic fast and fluid Command & Conquer gameplay, while retaining the core compulsions that fans have come to love over the series’ history.

It is the year 2062 and humanity is at the brink of extinction. Tiberium, the mysterious, alien crystalline structure that has infested Earth for decades and served as the primary reason for years of relentless conflict between the Global Defense Initiative (GDI) and the Brotherhood of Nod, is close to rendering the planet uninhabitable. Mankind is on the verge of extinction when Kane, Nod’s prophetic leader, emerges from seclusion to deliver GDI the message that he has developed a system that could control Tiberium and harness its power. But he cannot build this ""Tiberium Control Network"" without GDI’s cooperation. Thus, the two opposing factions – GDI and Nod – inevitably find themselves in desperation for the same cause: to stop Tiberium from extinguishing mankind.

After 15 years, the network is nearly complete, Tiberium is under strict control and our revitalized, newly terraformed planet is on the cusp of a new age of prosperity and progress. It is then that the world’s citizens begin to seriously ponder why Kane chose to help, and what will he want in return. These questions and more lead to the dramatic final act of the Tiberium saga.

With a multitude of innovative new features to the fast and fluid C&C gameplay, Command & Conquer 4 offers players an entirely new way to play C&C. An all-in-one mobile base, persistent player progression across all game modes that is constantly updated in a real-time online profile, a 3-class system for each of the two factions, co-operative play, and a 5v5 objective-based multiplayer mode that promotes teamwork and social interaction, make Command & Conquer 4 unlike any other C&C experience.","Behold disciples of Nod, for the end is soon upon us.

One of my biggest beefs with this game is that it's just plain short.  There are only 7 GDI missions,  7 NOD missions, and 3 common missions.  I finished it all in 14 hours.  Not much room in there for story.  The story they did have, and the cutscenes, seem very low budget and thrown together.  No Hollywood actors this time around.  The final cutscene in each campaign is literally the actors standing in front of a white sheet with a drawn picture.  If they had doubled the number of missions, I would be recommending this game.  It seems like they're trying to bring a lot of focus onto multiplayer, but I'm only interested in the single player aspect.

One thing that took a little while to get used to is that they changed the gameplay style.  Previous C&C games have had the formula of building/defending/expanding a base, managing your economy and power, and trying to push out as many units as you can.  In this game, you have a fixed number of points that can be redeemed for units, another set of points for structures, and third set for skill upgrades and expanding your tech tree.  There are no power plants, harvesters, etc.  And if a unit is killed or a structure is lost, you get your points refunded, and can build it again.  A key strategy is to continually move your MCV forward, towards the goal.  This makes most of the maps very linear.  Once you can get past the dramatic difference in play style, the game actually gets enjoyable.  Though some of the time, it just feels like you're filling up your build queue so you can spam the enemy.

With the new all-in-one MCV style, they added something that I thought was not well executed.  Instead of just one kind of MCV, they now have three:  offensive, defensive, and support.  Offensive is mostly for making units.  Defensive is for setting up structures like cannons and bunkers.  Support was totally useless to me, as it's for making repairs and setting up airstrikes.  The reason why this wasn't well executed is that you could only have one MCV at a time.  So you can't be defending a structure and attacking the enemy's MCV at the same time.","I have so many mixed emotions about this game.

Farlo in una saga così importante e nel suo capitolo conclusivo, inoltre, non è stata la scelta vincente.
Togliere completamente la gestione della costruzione della base ed eliminare la raccolta delle risorse in favore di un maggior dinamismo, poteva essere un buon punto di partenza, ma visto il risultato troppo approssimativo, questo quarto capitolo farà storcere il naso anche ai fan meno incalliti.
In Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight l'attenzione del giocatore non è più rivolta verso la fortificazione di un luogo sicuro da cui far partire i propri attacchi, ma viene diretta verso la gestione di poche unità e di una base mobile andando così a cambiare radicalmente il modo di giocare rispetto al passato.
Il fatto di non doversi più preoccupare di perdere la propria base principale ha portato pesanti modifiche anche nel sistema del gioco online lasciando così spazio a modalità più vicine alla freneticità degli sparatutto piuttosto che agli strategici, portando così il giocatore a lanciarsi negli scontri con il proprio arsenale spianato, anziché a ragionare e attendere il momento giusto per evitare di vanificare i preziosi momenti passati ad accumulare risorse e soldati come avveniva in passato.
Per fortuna non tutto è andato perduto; i video di intermezzo mantengono il carisma che da sempre caratterizza la saga del tiberium e la storia vi stupirà con diversi colpi di scena.
Interessante anche il fatto di poter giocare la campagna in modalità cooperativa nonostante questa sia di scarsa durata. Discorso a sé per il multiplayer che a causa dei livelli di esperienza e di alcune combinazioni di unità aeree dei GDI inarrestabili, si rivela un’esperienza online troppo sbilanciata.
In conclusione questo era un prodotto con le potenzialità per divenire un must, se solo si fosse limitato a essere Command & Conquer e non un titolo che ne mantiene solo il nome sulla copertina ma che ne modifica profondamente lo stile di gioco, non ottenendo i risultati desiderati",

However if we forget that this is a C&C game and judge it on its own merits.  I'll say this, first its a fast paced game and unlike  previous C&C games it requires you to think about using your units right as each unit now has a strength/weakness mechanic more so in this title.

Graphics wise its visual fideltiy is pretty impressive for an RTS game and even though the ammount of units you can have is limited the battles do in fact feel big, which is a plus.  

As this is a C&C game you can expect well acted real time cutscenes and these are the most impressive I'vse seen so far.

Now for problems.  

One of the major issues is that players can level up outside multiplayer and then take that rank/level into multiplayer, meaning there's no sense of progression and someonne can just anhilate you in multiplayer because you've not unlocked all the units/upgrades.

命令与征服4首先最不能容忍的就是将延续下来的，以资源转化为单位的传统RTS即时战略改成了以指挥点数为资源的即时战术游戏，——命令与征服作为RTS鼻祖之一最后落得必须更改为即时战术游戏，作为游戏标志的泰伯伦矿居然变成了升级用道具，难怪公布时玩家会大喊“还我大片大片可以收割的泰伯伦矿！”一款没有泰伯伦的命令与征服，这简直就是对命令与征服系列的亵渎。

至于游戏的在线模式完全就是在和同期的星海争霸2的模仿，仿效SC2一样采用与网络平台合体，强制联机的方式，将游戏的单机内容完全捆绑在在线模式之上，可是万万没想到的是，命令与征服4没有提供离线单机体验模式，很多人想打剧情，就只能连接上连线质量并不怎么好的EA服务器。并且还得注册一个EA账号（即后来origin账户），

另一方面，可能是对命令与征服3系列忽视命令与征服2的风格的一点“补偿”，本作矫枉过正的打造了一个满屏太空服士兵和机甲的战斗场面，但是这些机甲与命令与征服2的风格完全不搭界，三种机甲主基地的外观被斥之为“春卷”和“乌龟盖”，可以说明显就是画虎不成反类犬的一个体现。

至于剧情，在将Westwood硕果仅存的几个成员干掉之后，新的编剧Samuel Bass大展自己胡编乱造的能力，将原有“泰伯伦黄昏”的剧本完全无视，秉承着迫不及待将剧本写死的态度写出了一个漏洞百出的大结局，并且十分幼稚的秉承”只要把GDI写坏，把NOD洗白就好”的简单思维，把原本GDI虽代表正义但是内部腐化，NOD表面邪恶却拥有宗教一般的反派魅力的两种风格给彻底的黑白分明化，并且将其安插在一个犹如肥皂剧一般的剧本中，最终肯恩更是莫名其妙的离开地球了。

至此可以看出，这个剧本，就是为了判命令与征服本传系列死刑而写的，他自始至终就传达着一个意思：C&C——DIE！

在EA LA饱受摧残之后，命令与征服4成为了LA改组前的遗作，刚刚度过红色警报3的磨合期，整个命令与征服系列的标签从Westwood到EA LA，第二代CNC的风格崛起这一系列蒸蒸日上的迹象之后，EA LA又因为命令与征服4步了Westwood的后尘，于是我们看到了一个不伦不类的命令与征服4，以及其代表的真正的“泰伯伦黄昏”——属于命令与征服的黄昏。",

This game shows a fantastic idea, a fantastic concept, something that could have worked out great - IF IT DIDN'T HAVE THE LABEL AS A FULL ON SEQUEL TO THE TIBERIUM UNIVERSE C&C GAMES. As a spinoff, this game would have been mediocre, but as the official sequel and ending to the C&C storyline, this game is abysmal in every way possible.

Not a single thing feels C&C about this game - theres a tiny population cap, there's no base building, there's no resource collection, maps are small, the campaign is abysmal with a terrible storyline and cutscenes that don't just look bad - they are legitimately stuff someone likely recorded with their iphone camera and slapped into the game! Just watch any sections that involve the ""public"" speaking rather than paid actors. The only saving grace in the storyline is Joe Kucan, who as always takes the role of Kane and makes an extremely badass villain until a terrible ending that's the same regardless of which faction you go with - AN ENDING THAT'S THE SAME REGARDLESS OF WHICH FACTION YOU GO WITH. Let that sink in.

The progression system is terrible - yes, there's a progression system. This game revolves around collecting tiberium crystals INDIVIDUALLY and using them to upgrade your MCV to higher tiers to unlock better units and such. However, when you start, you are level 1 and have access to absolutely NOTHING. Only after you level up several times will you unlock the 2nd tier of technology which at first is completely worthless without a single thing used for it. Everything has to be unlocked through progression and this BLATANTLY makes anyone who's a higher level than you stronger than you with no workarounds based on how good of a player you are or anything, PERIOD. For example, you have to pick a class - offensive, defensive, or support. If you go defensive, at the beginning of the progression scale you only have access to 3 infantry units. No vehicles of any sort, period. While these infantry units CAN be used to counter other infantry, vehicles, or aircraft, they're all infantry and can be MUCH MORE EASILY COUNTERED by a diverse enemy army.

This is a game that again, has a fantastic concept that was soiled by something that clearly had the goal of being made with the least amount of funding possible, the least motivation possible, and the smallest amount of time necessary to produce it - probably so EA wouldn't have to pay people to work on this game any longer than they would have to before it was BARELY functional as a game and could be pushed out the door, which is exactly what they did.

And what sucks is, if everyone is maximum level on progression, the multiplayer can actually potentially be fun. It feels like the game was designed for that, but it was just unfinished, so to pad the length of the game and make people play it longer, they slapped progression in to make you grind to be level 20 (the cap).

Do not buy this game. If you want a good C&C game from recent times, go with Red Alert 3. Just don't expect any multiplayer options since this is the ONLY C&C GAME to not run on Gamespy and the gamespy servers are going to tank here in a month.","I tried really hard to like this game, as it's the final C&C game that it looks like we're getting in a long time - could even be the last the way EA is heading with their BS.

Конечно предполагалось что игра может быть спасительным кругом своей новой системой боя...но это был лишь фарс. Игру загубили и изничтожили как только смогли, хуже не куда. 
Графика:
Помните ту полу/реалистичную графику в Command & Conquer 3, эфекты лучей Скриннов или солдат NOD? так вот сдесь ее не ждите,тут непобоюсь этого слова УБОГИЙ ГРАФОН, да-да именно убогий, такое ощущение что я играю во вторую часть,даже на максималках это не торт-еще четче видны косяки моделей.
Игровая механика:
Хотите отстраивать базу создавать крутю армию или использовать другие тактические штучки? вам не сюда идите дальше.
В начале боя выбираем один из трех типов МСЦ который выыполняет роль бараков/завода и всех сданий сразу, создаем ограниченное число юнитов и илем в лобовую ибо враги тупы как пробки.
Сюжет:
Думали на этом ""вкусняшки"" остались? а вот фиг! Сюжет проходишь с трудом,но не из-за сложности, а из-за убогости всего чего только можно; Кейна превратили в откровенног г*вно,он потерял весь свой шарм и харизму, даже фразы бравых фанатиков звучат как слова умственно отсталых...мир попросту невозможно изучать из-за отвратительности всего и вся на кажлм шагу

Вообщем серию загубили- игру заканчиваешь с большим трудом пересиливая себя ее не удалять ради просмотра финальных роликов. Разве то игра в которой нужно себя пересилить и закончить? Увы и ах-конец франщизе-эта часть поставила жирную точку если не крест.",

Die Vorgänger von C&C waren um einiges besser. EA scheint wohl nur noch schnell Geld verdienen zu wollen. Nach einer Anmeldung in Origin (wobei das sehr unverständlich für mich ist da das Spiel in Steam ausreichend geschützt ist) bin ich dann ins Game gekommen.

So misserable war noch kein anderes C&C. Mit nur einer Spielmodi (Herrschaft) wird es schnell langweilig.

9542245,german,2014.02.18 20:08,✅,✅,0.6525940895,106,"Eins vorweg: Ich spiele C&C seit 1995, habe jeden Teil mehrfach durchgespielt, auch auf den höchsten Schwierigkeitsstufen und diverse Online und Lan Matches hinter mir. Kenne mich dementsprechend mit der Materie aus.

Kurzfassung

Ja, man kann das Spiel, wenn man es wie ich im Angebot kauft durchweg spielen, sollte es jedoch NICHT zu C&C zählen, dann macht das Spiel durchaus Spaß, auf wenn man egal mit welchem Crawler, einer mobilen Einheit die ähnlich der mobilen Waffenfabrik von Tiberian Sun ist, man eigentlich nur vor die gegnerische Basis fährt und den Gegner mit Einheiten totwirft.

Langfassung

Kampagne: Neben dem, schnellen und recht lustigen Multiplayer ist die Kampagne ja das eigentliche Augenmerk, leider wurde hier viel verändert. Der Spielcharakter ist mal wieder namenlos, hat diesmal eine Ehefrau in den Cutscenes die ebenfalls nicht mehr die Klasse anderer Teile erreichen. Die Charaktere sind, zumindest für mich unbekannt, flach, überspitzt kitschig und mit für mich unbekannten Schauspielern besetzt. Storyline mehr als flach, aber ich will hier nicht spoilern.

Grafik

Ungefähr auf höhe von Tiberium Wars, somit immer noch die Generäle Engine, die trotzdem irgendwie ""eckig"" wirkt in sachen Einheitenbewegung und Crawlerplatzierung, ähnlich Alarmstufe Rot 3.

Sound

Durchaus okay, bekannte Sprecher, EVA von der gleichen Person gesprochen wie in Tiberium Wars. Leider fehlt knackiges Geschützfeuer.

In eigener Sache

Leider wurde mal wieder einiges geändert, abgesehen vom Crawlersystem. C&C 4 sollte eigentlich ein Onlinespiel nur für den Asiatischen Raum sein und somit Starcraft ebenbürtig werden. Die Kampagne kam erst im nachhinein, das erklärt viele Logiklücken. Die typischen C&C Waffen wurden durch realistische wie z.B. P90 in Cutscenes geändert, die Hintergründe sind nur blinkende Computerwände, ähnlich Carters Versuchslabor bei Stargate SG1. Die GDI Uniformen wurden ebenfalls gegen realistische Uniformen getauscht. Zwar haben beide Seiten wieder SciFi Einheiten wie man es in der Zukunft auch erwartet, doch komsicherweise haben alle Leute scheinbar einen totalblackout, da scheinbar keiner mehr weiß das Schallwaffen Tiberiumkristalle zerstören. Die Liste geht noch um einige Punkte weiter, aber ich denke man versteht was ich sagen will.

Fazit

Nettes Skirmish/Multiplayerspiel, mit Online und EA Registrierungszwang, aber 0 Storyline. Ironischerweise sind die Entwickler teilweise jünger als ich selbst, vielleicht liegt bei der u20 Generation die akzeptanz für Action statt Story höher.

Absolutely the worst C&C game ever made, without a doubt, I don't know how EA could make C&C 3 so incredibly amazing and then do a couplete U-turn and make this.

The ""always-online"" that EA has a big hard-on for lately is a nightmare.
The only reason I bought this was to concluce the CnC tiberium storyline and even that was terrible. Did you know there's no more tiberium in this game? Literally, it's pretty much all gone. No base building, no harvesting resources. You can train units without any cost but only up to a very, very limited unit cap. I'm talking REAL limited. Like you can only train enough units to have a decent attack force or a decent defense force. Not both. I expect that kind of limit on a console RTs but not PC.

Honestly i don't understand why this game got such bad reviews. At no point are you ever forced into multiplayer, like one of the previous reviews said. I've been playing the campaigns and did a few skirmish maps with the AI to level my profile. Which does lead into one partial negative. That being the near necessity of playing one of the campaigns before you start skirmish modes. Apperently the unlocks are tied to yoru profile rank which is persistant in the campaign and skirmish. 

Game play's not really that aweful as some have described. It's more of a elite squad based kind of strategy take on C&C. That may be off putting to some, but you do have a ""base building"" option with the defense crawler. Just don't expect massive bases like in C&C3. I did find myself useing the offensive crawlers a little bit more than i would have liked.

So the story lines a little anti climactic. Sadly given that it's the end of the series, it would have been near impossible to have actually finished it properly for the majority of the fan base. So i can't fault it for that, though i do find fault in how the cutscenes follow through. It's like there are parts missing.

В C&C4 франшиза умерла с лёгкой подачи своего издателя - EA. Потому что в компании кто-то решил, что для бизнеса будет гораздо лучше, если новая часть будет совсем другой. В итоге мы получили следующее. Все базовые и незыблемые основы геймплея C&C спилены накорню, сюжет убог, обрезан и лишён смысловой нагрузки (И харизма Джо ""Кейна"" Кукана в этот раз не спасает). Вместо классических баз - три вида разбалансированных штаба, выбор между которыми всегда очевиден. Отсутствие классической экономики и ресурсов, скучные и лишённые тактики сражения. Роль Тибериума здесь -  отвечать за прокачку бесполезных и ограниченных в своей механике скиллов. И всё это безусловно печалит...
В игру не хочется играть, игровой мир не хочется изучать.  Приходится заставлять себя проходить сюжетку ради финальных роликов. А если играть приходится через силу - то что же это за игра? Где удовольствие?

Теперь об игре:
- Сюжет в этой игре рассказывает всю тайну о Кейне, разговоры в этой игре какие то вялые и скучные;
- Теперь базу не нужно строить вообще, теперь появились 3 краулера: Наступательный, Оборонительный и Поддержка. Это хорошая затей-ка разработчиков сделать игру поинтересней;
- Ещё в игре появилась прокачка Братства Нод и Глобального Совета Безопасности, максимальный уровень 20;
- На каждом уровне открывается, что-то новое, например: какие-нибудь новые войска, постройки или какое-нибудь улучшение;
- Хорошая сетевая игра, которая включает различные режимы, множество карт, короче она вас затянет на долго. Но игра требует постоянного подключения к Интернету, отсутствие которого приведет к потере продвижения.

It is difficult for me to articulate my feelings about Command & Conquer 4 Tiberian Twilight. All I really know is, I don't like it.

In some misguided attempt by what I can only assume is an ill-informed marketing department somewhere deep in the bowels of the EA mega structure this installment of the Command & Conquer franchise changes everything about the previous games. They even went so far as to remove the live action cut-scenes that, despite being where B-movie stars go to die, had become a benchmark in the industry.

You no longer build bases or harvest Tiberium, instead you get allocated a number of points that can be spent on units, when a unit die you get your points back and can try a new combination. It takes what used to be a very balanced RTS experience and turns it into an entirely micromanagement experience, and not a terribly good one at that.

This is not unlike what you might see in the later Dawn of War games but where Dawn of War balanced it with RPG elements making each unit seem important here you are just sending mindless, faceless entities towards a bunch of other mindless, faceless entities in the hope of beating the map objective before you mind rots from the monotone boredom.

Command & Conquer might be viewed by many as the classic simple RTS, but it was the one that monopolized the best on that approach and it was the franchise that more than any other made the real time strategy genre a force to be reckoned with.

Now it is nothing more a boring mediocre clone of a game, trying to do with all the other cool new RTS's are doing but not doing it nearly as well and losing what made the game special in the first place in the attempt.

It is a sad end for what was once such a proud franchise.

As the last game in the Kane saga, you would expect the story to be the best out of all the previous games. Unfortunately, the story is extremely short, confusing, and just plain boring at times. The game mechanics has also gone through a complete overhaul, but this change is not for the better. The gameplay is just too simple now that they've taken away building structures, resource mining, and the removal of some staple units. The new interface will probably throw off a lot of old C&C players as well. The biggest issue for me was with the balance of the game. You can build any unit extremely fast and since resources are gone, you aren't punished that much for losing all your forces. The only thing that made the game bearable was the co-op. Other than that, this game deviates too far from the series and I'd only recommend getting it for cheap and if you want to see how it all ends.","The C&C franchise has always had quality games but they really dropped the ball on this installment.

This game reeks of a rush job, as if EA was hurriedly seeking to close out and move from the CNC franchise. To call it underwhelming and disappointing is an understatement. Stay away unless you really feel compelled to complete your CNC collection.

GAMEPLAY
In one word: boring.

Harsh limits on the number of units you can control makes this feel like a tactical game, with none of the visceral satisfaction often seen in those games. The game is heavily based on counters/hard counters, but even in disparate matchups by this system, the  encounters take forever to finish.

Combine this with how easy it is to replace lost units, and missions quickly become a slog.

The singleplayer is a total dud in all aspects. Missions are linear and short, and there aren't many of them. The cutscenes show a similar lack of dedication, being completely forgettable and doing little to actually wrap up the Tiberium universe story.

The multiplayer was occasionally entertaining, but given that is rarely the reason I play an RTS, it was immaterial for me.

GRAPHICS/AUDIO
Technically speaking, they aren't bad. However, the cartoony visuals are at odds with the rest of the Tib universe (including CNC3), and unit designs are both bland and uninspired. Much of the same can be said about the audio.

Kane has glowing ball, ball makes tiberium behave, GDI and Kane has built tiberium-pipelines together. And on every map, every side has a reason to kill you somehow.

The game has some RPG elements to it which you can cap within 10 hours of non stop playing.  The dev's did away with base building and resource gathering instead you get a crawler similar to a command center which is mobile.  It creates all your units.  You get 3 crawlers to choose from either side.  Support, Offense and Defense each class has it's own unique unit's and abilities.  At first I enjoyed this game.  But removing resources and base's takes away a huge elemnet of why enjoy RTS games to begin with.  No economy to manage and no real ""home"" to protect 2 factors which add depth to RTS's.  Being able to manage those and your army add's alot to the gameplay and I miss it when playing this game.  If you don't appreciate those things in RTS's and prefer to get right into the action then this game is for you.  But not so much for me.  I bought it mainly to see the conclusion to the storyline. 6/10","As an avid RTS player CnC 4 strays from traditional RTS games and focus's on action.

I understand that EA was trying to inovate the classic RTS and went in with the best intentions; but they butchered it. Missions feel generic and bases are non-existent. I like the idea of the mobile bases, which has already been done in C&C2; but I feel as though I'm playing Dawn of War 2 rather than a C&C game. I played through a few skrimishes and about 8 missions. The learning curve is incredibly steep even on normal difficulty and the computer is unforgiving even in the first campaign missions. Lastly the game is more about how many units I can produce rather than using group tactics and formations. Do yourself a favor and go buy C&C3 kane's wrath. It is a much better game with a better structure of gameplay.","To anyone who respects this series.... DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.

September 2020 UPDATE:

Still a horrible mess of a game. The only thing that resembles C&C in this title is Kane, and even that is lackluster at best. 
The mechanics that made the C&C genre great are all missing from this. A complete waste of time and money.
This is a sad, lame version that almost no one can find anything redeeming about.
If you want to play the best C&C game then go find the original C&C here on Steam. It has been remastered and runs great on modern PCs. 
You'll be glad you did!","NOT C&C!!  STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME!!!
