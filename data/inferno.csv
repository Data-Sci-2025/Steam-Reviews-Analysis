You fail, you learn, and when you finally get it done, the feeling of accomplishment is incredible. The art and music are atmospheric, and you'll want to try again and again, just one more time. If you enjoy a skill-based challenge, this is definitely for you."
200359306,japanese,2025.06.22 13:49,✅,✅,0.5454545617,4,"ボールを上に上に蹴飛ばして頂上を目指す登山ゲーム
最近日本語化されたがこれが質が高く
ストーリーも登山ゲーなのにしっかり作られてて見応えアリ
面白かったけどボールの挙動が少々不安定で
こんなんで奈落まで落とされるのかと納得できない部分が多い
もし遊ぶのなら着実に上に進める
チェックポイントモードでやる事を強くオススメします","A mountain climbing game where you kick a ball up and up to reach the summit. It was recently translated into Japanese, and it's of high quality. The story is well-crafted and well worth watching, even though it's a mountain climbing game. It was fun, but the ball's behavior was a bit erratic. There were many parts where I couldn't quite understand why it was being dropped into the abyss. If you do play it, I highly recommend playing in checkpoint mode, where you can steadily progress upwards."
199164026,english,2025.06.07 06:04,✅,✅,0.5670238733,7,"A BRUTAL Climb, Worth Every Step

Ascending Inferno isn’t just a game – it’s an experience. From the very first level, it throws you headfirst into a gauntlet of challenges that test your patience, skill, and determination. But with every failure comes a deeper understanding, and with every hard-fought victory, an overwhelming sense of satisfaction. The difficulty is real, but so is the reward.

What truly elevates this game (pun intended) is its incredible storytelling. There’s a depth to the narrative that makes the climb feel meaningful – not just for progression’s sake, but because you're fighting for something. It’s rare to see this level of emotion tied to a platformer, but Ascending Inferno pulls it off with flair.

Visually, the game is absolutely stunning. Each biome introduces a completely fresh atmosphere – from the first level to the very last – and the attention to detail is unmatched. There are so many small, handcrafted touches scattered throughout the world that you can’t help but pause and admire, even in the middle of chaos.

Whether it’s the satisfying gameplay loop, the rich story, or the jaw-dropping art direction, Ascending Inferno nails it on every front. If you’re looking for a game that challenges you, rewards you, and leaves a lasting impact – this is it.","A BRUTAL Climb, Worth Every Step

Somehow they've managed to make this game both challenging and satisfying to play at the same time, to where even when I fall about a million times, I still have an immense amount of fun in the process, because simply just running around and kicking the ball is fun on its own. The game by its design constantly encourages you to improve by repetition until you've mastered a certain area, and I cant stress how rewarding it is seeing the progress you make, and especially when you FINALLY do that one kick that or jump that's been giving you hell. Overall, definitely one of my new favourite games and worth checking out!","The game is so based.

The game’s unforgiving nature may feel punishing at first, but it rewards perseverance—you’ll quickly notice yourself improving with every failure. While the inconsistent physics can occasionally frustrate, they add a unique layer of challenge fitting for the rage genre. In my two hours with the game, I only scratched the surface of its world, but its distinct charm, compelling story, and striking visuals left me eager to dive deeper.","Ascending Inferno is surprisingly addictive, effortlessly keeping you engaged for hours.

178976934,english,2024.10.14 07:03,✅,✅,0.5185185671,4,"Ascending Inferno is a cool video game that invites me to play it and then kicks me in the balls

At the time of writing I’ve beaten Limbo and gotten halfway through Lust

Each level of hell has its own distinct style and visual story to tell. There is so much wondrously morbid creativity and imaginative design proudly on display. The art direction is on point. Each asset is placed with narrative meaning rewarding players willing to stop and smell the roses. Hell feels like a living breathing place that I want to spend more time exploring.

The Shader Authoring and VFX are extremely impressive there's so many beautiful technical marvels hidden in this game. I particularly love the screen space reflection on the glass windows.

Secret rooms are like a respite in this game. Similar to a safe room in Resident Evil. I feel relieved when i accidently screw up a kick and then instead of getting punished I get rewarded with a story beat instead. Never seen this done in a video game and it suits a Foddian very well. More rewards like this please! 

The mechanics are deceptively deep for a game about kicking a ball in one direction. There is so much to chew on just kicking the ball, the mechanics all feed into each other and it makes you want to experiment and test the limits of what's possible. 

I can't help but feel these mechanics would’ve been better suited to a game that wasn't as punishing as a Foddian. The puzzles are fun but when I have to do the same puzzle for the 50th time instead of seeing the rest of the beautiful game ahead of me, I have to play Limbo and Lust again and again and again. Oh I get it, Hell, cute!

The Training Grounds attempt to remedy this by giving you a chance to practice each individual level outside of an official run of the game, which I like. But why not just let me start from a checkpoint in the actual game? I'm not a speedrunner. I don't care if the run is official or not, I just want to play the game all the way through. I hardly think my run is invalidated whether or not I did it with checkpoints. The game is hard as balls! GIVE ME MY SPIRIT ASHES

Also why do I have to trudge over to the ball every time? Why not have a teleport to the ball location? God knows I know the level well enough after running it 100 times, why do I have to do the walk of shame? If it's just to maximize the negative energy and despair then don't you think you have enough of that already?! 💀

I know I'm publicly admitting that I'm bad at video game but it feels like Ascending Inferno is too married to being a Foddian where it has such potential to be its own thing. It feels like it wants to stretch its wings but it's held back by expectations of the genre. There's so much competent level design and teaching the player through failure that is wasted on a negative gameplay loop that doesn't give me the motivation to try again. The unique look and pixel art style attracts casual and artistic players who may not be used to the level of punishment that a streamer or speedrunner would be. There are casual players who want to play your game, let them play it.

Ascending Inferno is challenging but it's not too hard intrinsically (as far as I've gotten). In a vacuum; the gameplay is fun and challenging and forces you to think outside your limitations and experiment, but the brutalizing punishment for failure makes it excruciating to learn and grow as a player. If you toned down the punishment with a few checkpoints it would lose its Foddian status but I also think it would make it a dramatically better video game.

A beautiful game with creative level design and deep mechanics that is held back by the constraints of the genre. Spread your wings Ascending Inferno! Miles Morales did his own thing, now it's your turn!

You can dribble the ball automatically when its at your feet, small or hard kick it to go forward, or jump when dribbling to make it go high and then aim yourself to hit the balls with your head.

The map is mostly fair from what i have played, with falls that aren't too punishing, and the only hard ish section i've met so far would be the end of gluttony with the 3 small lamp. Each time you complete a section you also have the opportunity to complete it in the training ground to either practice it or try to get a best time.

The gameplay itself is challenging but also very fun. A piece of my soul dies every time I run back down to the bottom of Lust, but it always feels like this time could be the one I get past that next obstacle. 
The controls feel good! I haven't felt like the controls were unfair or not doing what I want, it's pretty tight all around.
I like the little optional secret rooms, it's nice having a little break to see the characters chat.

Overall: love the game, controls feel good (I use controller), art is very cool and pretty. I definitely recommend for those who enjoy platformers and like a challenge.","First of all, I love the art in this game. The menus, the cutscenes, the environments are all beautiful and such a vibe.

This game is madness! From the incredible and unique art  (or at least, I haven't seen art with such gloss in a game before) to the extra incredible and unique game-concept - absolute madness. 

I love the 7 deadly sins concept for each level. The game play/mechanics are consistent and fair once you spend some time getting used to them. Also there are some hidden mechanics that the tutorial doesn't necessarily show you that make ascending even easier and hype-y like jumping kicks/flicks over your head (I saw a speedrun on youtube with said mechanics that I'm keen to put into practice). That being said, the challenge doesn't necessarily arise from the mechanics (as these play consistently) but decision making - deciding what is the best/safest move to do for each segment/platform - is where the challenge lies.

Also the little garnishes/details (like the customised distance ascended bar for each biome, and a separate camera for the ball) tell me that the devs have put extreme levels of effort and care into making this game. 

I have never really played platformers before, but I am so glad this is my introduction to the genre. AND SO FOR ANYONE ON THE FENCE on whether this game is worth buying/too hard: ABSOLUTELY GIVE IT A TRY. Yes, there are falls but they (at least for me) were part of the fun, and seeing my skills improve even after playing for a short session was extremely satisfying. 

With a little bit of persistence and bravery, I am 120000% sure you will have a fun time (mixed in with times where you feel the full range of human emotions). At the moment, I feel extreme  elation as I have just reached the second level (lust). I will angrily check back in s couple hours if I am still stuck at the same level - or worse: descending back to the start.

""Ascending Inferno"" is a masterpiece of visual design, crafted to match the beauty of an immaculately cared for garden. Each platform placed with care, each pit chosen to emphasis the question to the player. Every level being unique but complimentary to the experience. Each soundtrack being a complimentary masterful composition that tells you the story of this place.

I am drawn in and repeatedly posed the question. But what truly makes this game stand above all others is its ability to tap into the essence of this exact question. It allows for yourself and others to experience the world. It lets you celebrate your hard earned achievements where only one small miscalculation, one small miskick, one wrong input can easily undo your progress.

The hellish environment becomes a backdrop as you slowly progress, learning the exact position you must be on, the exact movement that is required to progress. You become Dani, and Dani becomes you. Knowing her ability to influence the world is mastery to answering the question.

So what is this question, you may be asking dear friends? What is this question that this masterful art piece poses to us, the players of this game?
Is it a question about life and death? Is it a question about success being a fine line from failure? Is it a question about relationships and connection?

Such a question cannot actually be expressed through the medium of words, for such a question can only be posed to the player through their own discovery.

This game will leave the player frustrated at their own actions, knowing every mistake is of their own doing.

EDIT: Okay, now that I've played for a couple hours, here's a legitimate review.

Ascending Inferno is certainly not for the faint of heart. If you're looking for a casual platformer that's approachable, forgiving, and with plenty of checkpoints, look elsewhere. But if you thrive off challenge, precision, and are seeking a unique platformer that's oozing with style, this is the perfect game to add to your library.

The gameplay is incredibly straightforward: progress upwards through a variety of platforming challenges to escape Inferno. However, this has to be done all whilst juggling a sentient soccer ball (who also happens to be your brother?) by using your own physics to ensure the ball ascends with you.

The catch? The ball can fall. Way down. Aaaaaaall the way down to the start of the level. Sometimes even back to a previous level if you're unlucky.

While this is tedious, it's also the perfect opportunity to hone your skills. You'll be repeatedly climbing and falling through particularly difficult sections of each level to the point where you become incredibly confident and most previous areas are a breeze. It's a strangely satisfying yet punishing difficulty curve.

This is massively enhanced by atmosphere which is dripping in Hellish style, combining stunning pixel and voxel art with neon lighting to produce backgrounds that put even Castlevania to shame. While I'm only in the second level of Inferno, Lust, I'm already blown away by the game's visual style and can't wait to see what's ahead (if I can make it that far!).

Overall, this is a game that those who embrace difficulty and challenge will truly resonate with. If you're a skilled platformer enthusiast, give it a go and put your skills to the test as you attempt (and your soccer ball) attempt to escape inferno.","About the same difficulty as real-life soccer. ⚽
